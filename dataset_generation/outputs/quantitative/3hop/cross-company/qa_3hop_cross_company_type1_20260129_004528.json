      "question": "How does Chevron's calculation of ROCE, which depends on its average capital employed, compare to ExxonMobil's ROCE in 2024 based on their respective average capital employed figures?",
      "answer": "Chevron's ROCE is calculated by dividing its net income (adjusted for after-tax interest expense and noncontrolling interest) by its average capital employed, which is derived from the average of the beginning and end-of-year capital employed. In 2024, ExxonMobil reported an average capital employed of $278,102 million and a ROCE of 12.7%. To directly compare Chevron's ROCE with ExxonMobil's, one would need Chevron's net income and average capital employed figures to compute its ROCE and then analyze the performance relative to ExxonMobil's 12.7% ROCE.",

          "chunk_text": "## Pension Benefits\n\nThe Corporation and its affiliates sponsor about 80 defined benefit (pension) plans in over 40 countries. The Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits footnote (Note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension expense.\n\nSome  of  these  plans  (primarily  non-U.S.)  provide  pension  benefits  that  are  paid  directly  by  their  sponsoring  affiliates  out  of corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage advance funding. Book reserves are established for these plans. The portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed as services are rendered. The portion attributable to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund assets.\n\nFor funded plans, including those in the U.S., pension obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements.  These  plans  are  managed  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  governmental  authorities  and  meet  or  exceed required  funding  levels  as  measured  by  relevant  actuarial  and  government  standards  at  the  mandated  measurement  dates.  In determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes.\n\nThe Corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as necessary. All defined-benefit pension obligations, regardless  of  the  funding  status  of  the  underlying  plans,  are  fully  supported  by  the  financial  strength  of  the  Corporation  or  the respective sponsoring affiliate.\n\nPension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount  rate  for  the  benefit  obligations  and  the  long-term  rate  for  future  salary  increases.  Pension  assumptions  are  reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2021 was 5.3 percent. The 10-year and 20year actual returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively. The Corporation establishes the longterm expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $190 million before tax.\n\nDifferences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.\n\n## Litigation and Tax Contingencies\n\nA variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant,  the  Corporation  discloses  the  nature  of  the  contingency  and  where  feasible,  an  estimate  of  the  possible  loss. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16.\n\nManagement judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict. However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect on operations or financial condition. In the Corporation's experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.\n\nThe Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. The benefits of uncertain tax positions that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict. The Corporation's unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in Note 19.",

In contrast, XOM's adjusted earnings were negatively impacted by foreign currency fluctuations, with a $13 million decrease driven by the weakening of the Egyptian pound and Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar, partially offset by the euro's strengthening.

Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

There was no appraisal activity in 2021. In August 2021, an Alaska federal judge vacated the U.S. government's approval granted to our planned Willow project previously approved by the BLM in October 2020.  The Department of Justice did not appeal the decision and neither did we.  We are actively supporting the BLM and Department of Interior as they conduct the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement process to address issues highlighted by the federal district court.  In the interim, we are continuing with FEED work in service of a final investment decision.\n\nThe Stony Hill 1 well located to the east of the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit within the NPR-A was plugged and abandoned in 2021 and expensed as a dry hole.\n\nA 3D seismic survey covering 234 square miles was completed in 2020 on state and federal lands.  We are currently evaluating this seismic data for future exploration opportunities.\n\nIn late 2021, the Coyote Brookian topset exploration prospect in the Kuparuk River Unit was tested with a near vertical sidetrack from an existing wellbore.  The well was fracture stimulated and will undergo well testing early in 2022 to confirm longer term deliverability.\n\n## Transportation\n\nWe transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of Trans  -Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).  We have a 29.5 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in and operate the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.\n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double -hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels, as necessary.  The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S.\n\n## Lower 48\n\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the Gulf of Mexico.  The segment is organized into the Permian and Gulf Coast and Rockies business units with a portfolio of low cost of supply, short cycle time, resource-rich unconventional plays, and conventional production from legacy assets. Based on 2021 production volumes, the Lower 48 is the company's largest segment and contributed 55 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 64 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\nIn 2021, we completed two acquisitions significantly increasing our Permian position in the Lower 48.  On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho adding complementary acreage across the Delaware and Midland basins.  On December 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Shell's Delaware Basin position adding significant Texas acreage in the Delaware Basin.  The accounting close date used for reporting purposes of the Shell transaction was December 31, 2021.  For additional information related to these acquisitions, see Note 3 .",

      "answer": "COP's acquisition of additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit added approximately 5 MBOED in November and December 2024, partially offsetting their overall production decline of 1 MBOED for the year. In contrast, XOM experienced natural field declines, particularly in tight-oil plays with higher initial decline rates, which they aim to mitigate through a $27\u201329 billion investment program in 2025. Thus, while COP used strategic acquisitions to counteract decline, XOM focused on portfolio diversification and new project development to maintain production levels.",

          "chunk_text": "\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $23.2 billion at the end of 2024, down $8.4 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2024 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $35.1 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $23.4 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $5.0 billion, other investing activities of $1.9 billion, and cash acquired from mergers and acquisitions of $0.8 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions  to  property,  plant  and  equipment  of  $24.3  billion;  dividends  to  shareholders  of  $16.7  billion;  the  purchase  of  Ex x onMobil  stock  of  $19.6  billion; debt repayment of $5.9 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.3 billion; and an increase in working capital of $1.8 billion.\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $31.6 billion at the end of 2023, up $1.9 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2023 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $37.4 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $20.6 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $4.1 billion, and other investing activities of $1.6 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $21.9 billion; dividends to shareholders of $14.9 billion; the purchase of ExxonMobil stock of $17.7 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.0 billion; and a change in working capital of $4.3 billion.\n\nThe Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On December 31, 2024, the Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term lines of credit of $1.3 billion.\n\nTo support cash flows in future periods, the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields to eventually produce at declining rates for the remainder of their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the Corporation's key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation's net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.\n\nThe Corporation has long been successful at mitigating the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and international trade patterns and relations. The Corporation's cash flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A for a more complete discussion of risks.\n\nThe Corporation's financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures.  Cash  Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion, reflecting the  Corporation's continued active investment program, and includes plans to invest in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion in 2025 (see the Cash Capital Expenditures section for more details).\n\nActual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.  The  Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development  projects  and  exploration  opportunities,  which  helps  mitigate  the  overall  political  and  technical  risks  of  the  Corporation's  Upstream  segment  and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation's liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fix ed commitments.",

Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

      "question": "How does the increase in CVX's present value of proved reserves in 2021 relate to the expected life of assets, and how might this impact XOM's depreciation methodology for similar asset lifespans?",
      "answer": "CVX experienced a significant increase of $55,441 million in the present value of its proved reserves in 2021, which indicates improved asset valuation. This aligns with an 'Expected Life' of 4.2\u20135.4 years observed in the same period, suggesting longer asset usability contributed to the valuation increase. XOM, which uses the unit-of-production method for depreciation but resorts to straight-line depreciation for assets with shorter economic lives than reserves, may opt for accelerated depreciation if asset lives fall below the 4.2-year threshold, impacting its financials.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 2021: CVX's present value of proved reserves increased by $55,441 million in 2021, indicating improved asset valuation.",
        "Hop 2: 2021 \u2192 Expected Life: The 'Expected Life' of assets in 2021 ranged from 4.2 to 5.4 years, suggesting longer usable life may have contributed to the increase in present value.",
        "Hop 3: Expected Life \u2190 XOM: XOM uses straight-line depreciation for assets whose useful life does not align with reserve depletion, meaning assets with life spans below 4.2 years may be depreciated faster, affecting financial outcomes."

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe  Corporation  excludes  from  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  certain  sales  and  value-added  taxes  imposed  on  and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for  which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  that  arise  from  existing  assets,  liabilities,  firm  commitments  and  forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative.  All  gains  and  losses  from  derivative  instruments  for  which  the  Corporation  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil,  products  and  merchandise  inventories  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  current  market  value  or  cost  (generally  determined under the last-in, first-out method - LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and  indirectly  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventory  to  its  existing  condition  and  location.  Selling  expenses  and  general  and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this  method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well  and  where  the  Corporation  is  making  sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production  method  or  the  straight-line  method,  which  is  based  on  estimated  asset  service  life  taking  obsolescence  into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas  that  are  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  using  current  operating  methods.  Under  the  unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  unit-of-production  method  does  not  result  in  an  equitable  allocation  of  cost  over  the  economic  life  of  an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.",

      "answer": "CVX's natural gas production increased by 354 MMCFD (from 1,758 MMCFD in 2022 to 2,112 MMCFD in 2023), which contrasts with COP's Alaska segment, where natural gas production contributed only 2% of COP\u2019s consolidated output in 2023 and was not a primary focus compared to liquids. This suggests that while CVX saw significant growth in natural gas production, COP's Alaska operations had a minimal role in its overall natural gas portfolio, with production declines in the segment attributed to normal field decline, despite new wells in the Western North Slope and Greater Kuparuk Area.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "In 2024, XOM reported proved developed crude oil reserves of 375 million barrels in the Americas, while COP reported 1,841 million barrels in the Lower 48 region alone. This suggests that COP has a more concentrated upstream strategy in North America, particularly in the Lower 48, compared to XOM, whose proved developed reserves in the Americas are significantly lower and may indicate a more diversified global upstream portfolio.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

      "answer": "The $148.2 billion upstream PP&E value at XOM depends heavily on proved reserves estimates because reserve volumes are used to calculate unit-of-production depreciation rates. XOM relies on its Global Reserves and Resources Group, staffed with experts averaging over 15 years of experience, to ensure reserves estimates comply with SEC rules. However, CVX notes that extended low oil prices can negatively impact proved reserves, which in turn would affect depreciation calculations and asset valuations, highlighting the interconnected sensitivity of upstream asset values to reserves estimation accuracy.",

      "answer": "CVX's U.S. pension benefits are projected to grow from $826 million in 2022 to a peak of $1,025 million in 2025, before slightly declining through 2026. This growth trajectory implies increasing pension obligations over the five-year period. COP, on the other hand, uses a 4.00% rate of compensation increase in its assumptions for U.S. pension benefits, which directly influences the actuarial valuation of future liabilities. Given that compensation increases feed into pension benefit calculations, COP's assumption of a 4% annual increase suggests a forward-looking expectation of rising pension obligations. Therefore, the rising pension benefit figures from CVX align with the type of long-term liability growth that would be consistent with COP's assumption of a 4% rate of compensation increase.",

        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 U.S. Pension Benefits: CVX discloses specific dollar amounts for U.S. pension benefits from 2022 to 2026, showing a rise from $826 million to $1,025 million by 2025.",
        "Hop 2: U.S. Pension Benefits \u2192 Rate of Compensation Increase: The rate of compensation increase (4.29% for 2021 in the data) is a key actuarial assumption that directly affects the valuation and future growth of pension benefits.",

      "question": "How did the impact of lower commodity prices on Chevron's production in 2024 compare with the earnings decline in ConocoPhillips' Lower 48 segment, particularly in light of the Marathon Oil acquisition's influence on production volumes?",
      "answer": "Chevron's production was negatively impacted by extended periods of low commodity prices in 2024, which affected upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs. At the same time, ConocoPhillips' Lower 48 segment reported a decrease in earnings from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024, partly due to lower commodity prices ($904 million impact), despite increased production volumes driven by the Marathon Oil acquisition, which added 334 MBOED in December 2024. This indicates that while production volumes were boosted by the acquisition, the broader market pressure from falling prices still led to a significant earnings decline, mirroring Chevron\u2019s exposure to commodity price volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\ngrowth,  including  low  or  negative  growth;  industry  production  and  inventory  levels;  technology  advancements,  including  those  in  pursuit  of  a  lower  carbon economy; production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers; weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control; competing fuel prices; geopolitical risks; the pace of energy transition; customer and consumer preferences and the use of substitutes; and governmental regulations, policies and other actions regarding the development of oil and gas reserves, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business, including our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, transferred liabilities, including for decommissioning of previously divested assets, have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently defaults on the assumed transferred liabilities (e.g., bankruptcy). In addition, ex tended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity  of  the  company's  suppliers,  vendors,  partners  and  equity  affiliates  upon  which  the  company's  own  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition depend.\n\nThe scope of Chevron's business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful  in  replacing  the  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  it  produces  with  good  prospects  for  future  organic  opportunities  or  through  acquisitions,  ex ploration  or technology, the company's business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; technology advancements; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.\n\nThe company's operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company's operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, and other forms of severe weather; wildfires; ambient temperature increases; sea level rise; war or other military conflicts such as the conflict in the Middle East and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine; accidents; civil unrest; political events; fires; earthquakes; system failures; cyber threats; terrorist acts; and epidemic or pandemic diseases, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\n\nChevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital  investment  reviews  and  decisions  incorporate  potential  ranges  of  physical  risks  such  as  storm  severity  and  frequency,  sea  level  rise,  air  and  water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\nCyberattacks and events affecting Chevron's operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company's information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. The cyber risk landscape changes over time due to a variety of internal and external factors,",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) reported a decrease in its NGL price from $37.70 per barrel in 2022 to $26.13 per barrel in 2023, a decline of $11.57 per barrel. ExxonMobil (XOM) reported a drop in its combined crude oil and NGL realization from $87.25 per barrel in 2022 to $69.85 per barrel in 2023, a decline of $17.40 per barrel. Given that NGL realizations are typically lower than crude prices and are influenced by product-specific demand and processing economics, the sharper decline in XOM\u2019s realization suggests broader industry pressure on NGL values, potentially exacerbated by downstream margin compression or weaker petrochemical demand.",

The remaining extensions and discoveries were driven by the continued development planned in the other geographic regions, including Canada, Lower 48 unconventional plays, and Alaska.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves were driven by the ongoing development of our assets. Approximately 75 percent of the transfers were from the development of our Lower 48 unconventional plays. The remainder of transfers were from development across the other geographic regions.\n\nAt both December 31, 2024 and 2023, our PUDs represented 35 percent of total proved reserves. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2024, relating to the development of PUDs were $9.4 billion. A portion of our costs incurred each year relates to development projects where the PUDs will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.\n\nAt the end of 2024, approximately 88 percent of total PUDs were under development or scheduled for development within five years of initial disclosure, i ncluding all of our Lower 48 PUDs. The PUDs to be developed beyond five years are in the Willow project in Alaska, a development that is currently underway with production anticipated in 2029 due to its large scale and remote location, as well as in major development areas which are currently producing and l ocated in Canada and in our equity affiliate in Australia.",

          "chunk_text": "Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

      "answer": "COP's acquisition of an additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit added approximately five MBOED of production in November and December 2024, partially offsetting the one MBOED decline in overall production due to normal field decline. This strategic acquisition positively impacted COP's production levels. In contrast, CVX notes that sustained low commodity prices can negatively impact upstream earnings, cash flows, and production levels, potentially leading to asset impairments and reduced capital investment. Therefore, while COP's production received a near-term boost from the acquisition, CVX's production could face downward pressure under similar market conditions, highlighting divergent production outcomes under different strategic and market contexts.",

Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business, including our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, transferred liabilities, including for decommissioning of previously divested assets, have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently defaults on the assumed transferred liabilities (e.g., bankruptcy). In addition, ex tended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity  of  the  company's  suppliers,  vendors,  partners  and  equity  affiliates  upon  which  the  company's  own  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition depend.\n\nThe scope of Chevron's business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful  in  replacing  the  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  it  produces  with  good  prospects  for  future  organic  opportunities  or  through  acquisitions,  ex ploration  or technology, the company's business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; technology advancements; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.\n\nThe company's operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company's operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, and other forms of severe weather; wildfires; ambient temperature increases; sea level rise; war or other military conflicts such as the conflict in the Middle East and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine; accidents; civil unrest; political events; fires; earthquakes; system failures; cyber threats; terrorist acts; and epidemic or pandemic diseases, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\n\nChevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital  investment  reviews  and  decisions  incorporate  potential  ranges  of  physical  risks  such  as  storm  severity  and  frequency,  sea  level  rise,  air  and  water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\nCyberattacks and events affecting Chevron's operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company's information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches.

      "answer": "CVX recognized $363 million in settlement losses in 2023 for its U.S. pension plans, indicating significant pension liability settlements during the year. In contrast, COP's 2023 pension-related comprehensive income included a $48 million net change from actuarial gains/losses and a separate $67 million amortization of actuarial loss included in income, suggesting a less aggressive approach to pension liability restructuring compared to CVX. This contrast highlights differing pension liability management strategies, with CVX actively settling obligations (resulting in large one-time losses), while COP experienced ongoing actuarial losses without similar settlement activity.",

The major sources of funds in 2024 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $35.1 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $23.4 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $5.0 billion, other investing activities of $1.9 billion, and cash acquired from mergers and acquisitions of $0.8 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions  to  property,  plant  and  equipment  of  $24.3  billion;  dividends  to  shareholders  of  $16.7  billion;  the  purchase  of  Ex x onMobil  stock  of  $19.6  billion; debt repayment of $5.9 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.3 billion; and an increase in working capital of $1.8 billion.\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $31.6 billion at the end of 2023, up $1.9 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2023 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $37.4 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $20.6 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $4.1 billion, and other investing activities of $1.6 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $21.9 billion; dividends to shareholders of $14.9 billion; the purchase of ExxonMobil stock of $17.7 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.0 billion; and a change in working capital of $4.3 billion.\n\nThe Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On December 31, 2024, the Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term lines of credit of $1.3 billion.\n\nTo support cash flows in future periods, the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields to eventually produce at declining rates for the remainder of their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the Corporation's key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation's net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.\n\nThe Corporation has long been successful at mitigating the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and international trade patterns and relations. The Corporation's cash flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A for a more complete discussion of risks.\n\nThe Corporation's financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures.  Cash  Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion, reflecting the  Corporation's continued active investment program, and includes plans to invest in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion in 2025 (see the Cash Capital Expenditures section for more details).\n\nActual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.  The  Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development  projects  and  exploration  opportunities,  which  helps  mitigate  the  overall  political  and  technical  risks  of  the  Corporation's  Upstream  segment  and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation's liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fix ed commitments.",

      "answer": "Chevron allocates $274 million of its restructuring charge to the 'All Other' segment in 2024, which includes corporate administrative functions, insurance, real estate, and notably, technology activities. This suggests active reorganization of corporate-level functions, potentially impacting how technology is resourced or prioritized. In contrast, ConocoPhillips includes technology activities\u2014along with corporate overhead and interest expenses\u2014within its 'Corporate and Other' segment, which does not directly align with any operating segment but supports overall company strategy. This difference implies that while Chevron is actively restructuring its corporate functions including technology, ConocoPhillips integrates technology more passively into its corporate framework, signaling divergent strategic approaches to innovation and digital transformation within their broader cost and operational models.",

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

          "chunk_text": "If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.  The accounting notion of 'sufficient progress' is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable.  Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control.  Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained.  Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.\n\nAt year-end 2021, total suspended well costs were $660 million, compared with $682 million at year-end 2020. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 6 .\n\n## Proved Reserves\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information.  Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.\n\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of 'proved' reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations.  There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as 'proved.' Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines.  We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.  See Oil and Gas supplemental disclosures for additional information.\n\nProved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field.  Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on 12-month average prices and current costs.  This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.  Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,  the estimate of proved reserves also changes.  Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.\n\nOur proved reserves include estimat  ed quantities related to PSCs, reported under the 'economic interest' method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs.  If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.  We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.\n\nThe estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production  calculation of the DD&amp;A of the capitalized costs for that asset.  At year-end 2021, the net book value of productive PP&amp;E subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $52 billion and the DD&amp;A recorded on these assets in 2021 was approximately $7.0 billion.  The estimated proved reserves for our consolidated operations were 2.5 billion BOE at the end of 2020 and 4.0 billion BOE at the end of 2021.  If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&amp;A in 2021 would have increased by an estimated $774 million.",

Syncrude  is  a  joint  venture  established  to  recover  shallow  deposits  of  oil  sands  using  open-pit  mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest  in  Imperial  Oil  Limited.  In  2021,  the  company's  share  of  net  production  of  synthetic  crude  oil  was  about  62  thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 55 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.\n\nKearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract  the  crude  bitumen.  Imperial  Oil  Limited  holds  a  70.96  percent  interest  in  the  joint  venture  and  ExxonMobil  Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.\n\nKearl  is  located  approximately  40  miles  north  of  Fort  McMurray,  Alberta,  Canada.  Bitumen  is  extracted  from  oil  sands  and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2021, average net production at Kearl was about 251 thousand barrels per day.\n\nDuring  2021,  approximately  2.4  billion  barrels  of  bitumen  at  Kearl  were  added  to  proved  reserves  primarily  as  a  result  of  an improved SEC price basis versus 2020.\n\n## 5.

Syncrude  is  a  joint  venture  established  to  recover  shallow  deposits  of  oil  sands  using  open-pit  mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest  in  Imperial  Oil  Limited.  In  2021,  the  company's  share  of  net  production  of  synthetic  crude  oil  was  about  62  thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 55 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.\n\nKearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract  the  crude  bitumen.  Imperial  Oil  Limited  holds  a  70.96  percent  interest  in  the  joint  venture  and  ExxonMobil  Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.\n\nKearl  is  located  approximately  40  miles  north  of  Fort  McMurray,  Alberta,  Canada.  Bitumen  is  extracted  from  oil  sands  and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2021, average net production at Kearl was about 251 thousand barrels per day.\n\nDuring  2021,  approximately  2.4  billion  barrels  of  bitumen  at  Kearl  were  added  to  proved  reserves  primarily  as  a  result  of  an improved SEC price basis versus 2020.\n\n## 5.

      "answer": "The drop in ExxonMobil's crude oil realization from $87.25 in 2022 to $69.85 in 2023 indicates a market price decline that could influence upstream investment decisions. Chevron, which projects a four to seven percent production increase in 2024 assuming a $80 per barrel Brent crude price, may reassess its capital allocation or production targets if lower realizations persist. This dynamic highlights how upstream economics are sensitive to crude price volatility, with Chevron's strategic planning directly tied to price assumptions that impact return expectations and reserve development timelines.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

There was no appraisal activity in 2021. In August 2021, an Alaska federal judge vacated the U.S. government's approval granted to our planned Willow project previously approved by the BLM in October 2020.  The Department of Justice did not appeal the decision and neither did we.  We are actively supporting the BLM and Department of Interior as they conduct the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement process to address issues highlighted by the federal district court.  In the interim, we are continuing with FEED work in service of a final investment decision.\n\nThe Stony Hill 1 well located to the east of the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit within the NPR-A was plugged and abandoned in 2021 and expensed as a dry hole.\n\nA 3D seismic survey covering 234 square miles was completed in 2020 on state and federal lands.  We are currently evaluating this seismic data for future exploration opportunities.\n\nIn late 2021, the Coyote Brookian topset exploration prospect in the Kuparuk River Unit was tested with a near vertical sidetrack from an existing wellbore.  The well was fracture stimulated and will undergo well testing early in 2022 to confirm longer term deliverability.\n\n## Transportation\n\nWe transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of Trans  -Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).  We have a 29.5 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in and operate the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.\n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double -hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels, as necessary.  The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S.\n\n## Lower 48\n\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the Gulf of Mexico.  The segment is organized into the Permian and Gulf Coast and Rockies business units with a portfolio of low cost of supply, short cycle time, resource-rich unconventional plays, and conventional production from legacy assets. Based on 2021 production volumes, the Lower 48 is the company's largest segment and contributed 55 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 64 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\nIn 2021, we completed two acquisitions significantly increasing our Permian position in the Lower 48.  On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho adding complementary acreage across the Delaware and Midland basins.  On December 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Shell's Delaware Basin position adding significant Texas acreage in the Delaware Basin.  The accounting close date used for reporting purposes of the Shell transaction was December 31, 2021.  For additional information related to these acquisitions, see Note 3 .",

These expenses increased by $359 million in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to transaction expenses of $432 million associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs. See Note 15 .\n\nTechnology includes our investments in low-carbon technology opportunities as well as other new technologies or businesses and licensing revenues. Other new technologies or businesses and LNG licensing activities are focused on both conventional and tight oil reservoirs, shale gas, oil sands, enhanced oil recovery as well as LNG. Earnings in Technology decreased due to increased costs in low-carbon and other new technologies and lower licensing revenues.\n\nOther income (expense) or \"Other\" includes certain foreign currency transaction gains and losses, environmental costs associated with sites no longer in operation, other costs not directly associated with an operating segment, gains or losses on early retirement of debt, holding gains or losses on equity securities and pension settlement expense. Earnings in 'Other' increased by $422 million in 2024 compared with 2023. This was primarily due to a tax benefit of $455 million as a result of the acquisition of Marathon Oil and the subsequent utilization of foreign tax credits, and the absence of $89 million loss associated with forward foreign exchange contracts to buy CAD, in support of our acquisition of additional working interest in Surmont in 2023. Decreases to earnings in \"Other\" were driven by a loss of $147 million associated with the extinguishment of debt in the fourth quarter of 2024. See Note 3, Note 8 and Note 16 .",

      "question": "How does the sensitivity of ExxonMobil's benefit plan assets to changes in long-term rate of return assumptions compare to Chevron's, given the differences in their investment strategies and pension asset allocation approaches?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's benefit plan assets, which are primarily invested in passive global equity and local currency fixed income index funds with target allocations of 10\u201335% in equities, are structured for broad diversification and cost minimization. Chevron, in contrast, uses asset/liability studies to guide its pension asset allocations and assumed a 7.0% long-term rate of return for its U.S. pension plan in 2023, which accounted for 71% of its total pension assets. Both companies are exposed to sensitivity in pension obligations and expenses due to changes in long-term rate of return assumptions, as noted in Verizon\u2019s 10-K, which states that changes in these assumptions can significantly impact benefit obligations and expense. Therefore, while both firms are sensitive to shifts in return expectations, ExxonMobil\u2019s passive index-based strategy may exhibit different volatility characteristics compared to Chevron\u2019s more actively studied and risk-factor-informed approach.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's Global Reserves and Resources Group ensures the reliability of proved reserves estimates through rigorous technical evaluations, commercial assessments, and data analysis, with oversight of SEC compliance and centralized database controls. This group, staffed with experts averaging over 15 years of experience, mandates endorsement of all reserves changes, ensuring data integrity. However, Chevron's proved reserves are negatively impacted by extended periods of low crude oil prices, which can reduce capital spending and affect the economic viability of reserves development. Chevron notes that a sustained downturn could materially affect its reserves and upstream operations, highlighting the sensitivity of proved reserves to commodity price fluctuations.",

        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Global Reserves and Resources Group: ExxonMobil maintains a dedicated reserves oversight group with technical expertise and centralized controls to ensure accurate and compliant proved reserves estimates.",

      "answer": "XOM defines ROCE as net income attributable to ExxonMobil (excluding the after-tax cost of financing) divided by total corporate average capital employed, emphasizing its use for evaluating historical capital productivity. CVX calculates ROCE as net income attributable to Chevron (adjusted for after-tax interest expense and noncontrolling interest) divided by average capital employed, which is computed by averaging the beginning and end-of-year capital employed. In 2022, CVX reported an average capital employed of $174,175 million. These differences in ROCE methodology suggest that while both companies use ROCE for performance evaluation, XOM focuses more on segment-level capital productivity, whereas CVX adjusts for financing costs and minority interests, potentially impacting how capital efficiency is assessed across the two firms.",

These segment earnings include ExxonMobil's share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our  capital  employed  definition,  and  exclude  the  cost  of  financing. The  Corporation's  total  ROCE  is  net  income  attributable  to ExxonMobil excluding the after-tax cost of financing, divided by total corporate average capital employed. The Corporation has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as one of the best measures of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry.

      "answer": "Chevron calculates ROCE by dividing net income after adjustments ($16,351 million in 2022) by average capital employed ($174,175 million in 2022), which includes the average of beginning and end-of-year capital. This aligns with ExxonMobil's general methodology, which also uses average capital employed in computing ROCE. However, ExxonMobil specifically excludes the after-tax cost of financing from its ROCE calculation, whereas Chevron adjusts net income for after-tax interest and noncontrolling interest but does not explicitly mention excluding financing costs in the same way. This subtle difference in treatment suggests variations in how each company defines earnings for ROCE purposes despite a shared reliance on average capital employed as the denominator.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 Average Capital Employed: Chevron reports a 2022 average capital employed of $174,175 million and net income after adjustments of $16,351 million, which are used to calculate ROCE.",
        "Hop 2: Average Capital Employed \u2192 ROCE: Chevron defines ROCE as net income (adjusted for after-tax interest and noncontrolling interest) divided by average capital employed, which is the average of beginning and end-of-year capital.",
        "Hop 3: ROCE \u2190 XOM: ExxonMobil also uses average capital employed in its ROCE calculation but explicitly excludes the after-tax cost of financing, indicating a methodological difference in the numerator despite similar treatment of the denominator."

ExxonMobil's methodology emphasizes recoverability through existing wells and facilities, and its reserves are sensitive to price changes and development strategies.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "Chevron developed 464 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) in U.S. proved undeveloped reserves in 2024, primarily from the Midland and Delaware basins, the Gulf of America, and the DJ basin. This compares to ConocoPhillips' total consolidated crude oil reserves of 3,406 million barrels at the end of 2024, meaning Chevron's 2024 development activity alone represented approximately 13.6% of ConocoPhillips' total crude oil reserves position. This comparison highlights the scale of Chevron's reserve development activity relative to a peer's overall crude oil reserves base.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

The major sources of funds in 2024 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $35.1 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $23.4 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $5.0 billion, other investing activities of $1.9 billion, and cash acquired from mergers and acquisitions of $0.8 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions  to  property,  plant  and  equipment  of  $24.3  billion;  dividends  to  shareholders  of  $16.7  billion;  the  purchase  of  Ex x onMobil  stock  of  $19.6  billion; debt repayment of $5.9 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.3 billion; and an increase in working capital of $1.8 billion.\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $31.6 billion at the end of 2023, up $1.9 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2023 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $37.4 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $20.6 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $4.1 billion, and other investing activities of $1.6 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $21.9 billion; dividends to shareholders of $14.9 billion; the purchase of ExxonMobil stock of $17.7 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.0 billion; and a change in working capital of $4.3 billion.\n\nThe Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On December 31, 2024, the Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term lines of credit of $1.3 billion.\n\nTo support cash flows in future periods, the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields to eventually produce at declining rates for the remainder of their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the Corporation's key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation's net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.\n\nThe Corporation has long been successful at mitigating the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and international trade patterns and relations. The Corporation's cash flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A for a more complete discussion of risks.\n\nThe Corporation's financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures.  Cash  Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion, reflecting the  Corporation's continued active investment program, and includes plans to invest in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion in 2025 (see the Cash Capital Expenditures section for more details).\n\nActual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.  The  Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development  projects  and  exploration  opportunities,  which  helps  mitigate  the  overall  political  and  technical  risks  of  the  Corporation's  Upstream  segment  and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation's liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fix ed commitments.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024.

Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business, including our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, transferred liabilities, including for decommissioning of previously divested assets, have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently defaults on the assumed transferred liabilities (e.g., bankruptcy). In addition, ex tended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity  of  the  company's  suppliers,  vendors,  partners  and  equity  affiliates  upon  which  the  company's  own  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition depend.\n\nThe scope of Chevron's business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful  in  replacing  the  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  it  produces  with  good  prospects  for  future  organic  opportunities  or  through  acquisitions,  ex ploration  or technology, the company's business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; technology advancements; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.\n\nThe company's operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company's operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, and other forms of severe weather; wildfires; ambient temperature increases; sea level rise; war or other military conflicts such as the conflict in the Middle East and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine; accidents; civil unrest; political events; fires; earthquakes; system failures; cyber threats; terrorist acts; and epidemic or pandemic diseases, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\n\nChevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital  investment  reviews  and  decisions  incorporate  potential  ranges  of  physical  risks  such  as  storm  severity  and  frequency,  sea  level  rise,  air  and  water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\nCyberattacks and events affecting Chevron's operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company's information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches.

This calculation methodology aligns with ExxonMobil's approach, where ROCE is used as a core performance metric that excludes financing costs and is based on average capital employed.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "CVX reported a $56 million settlement loss in its 2024 U.S. pension benefits, indicating potential pension payout activity or restructuring. In contrast, COP's 2024 disclosures show no mention of settlement losses in their pension or other benefits, suggesting a different approach to managing pension liabilities. The divergence in settlement loss recognition may reflect distinct pension de-risking strategies, with CVX possibly accelerating benefit payments or lump sum settlements, while COP appears to have avoided such actions in 2024.",

      "answer": "CVX estimates that under a $80 Brent crude oil price assumption, its 2024 net oil-equivalent production will increase by 4-7% over 2023 levels. However, XOM's 2023 crude oil realization was only $69.85 per barrel, significantly below the $80 assumed price, indicating a $10.15 per barrel compression in realized prices compared to a benchmark crude price. This margin compression highlights the upstream sector's tendency to realize prices below global benchmarks due to regional differentials, transportation costs, and quality adjustments, which could constrain CVX's actual production economics despite the optimistic production growth forecast.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil.

This aligns with the general principle that lower discount rates increase present values of liabilities. Similarly, COP used present value techniques in valuing oil and gas properties during acquisitions, relying on market-based discount rates as a key input.

Estimating the fair values involved  making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties.  Management utilized a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and engaged third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates.\n\nSignificant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market -based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition.  When estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.\n\nThe assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ. See Note 3 .\n\n## Impairments\n\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration  in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group.  If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans.  If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the determination is made.  Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a field-by-field basis for E&amp;P assets.  Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.\n\nThe expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review.  Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 6 and Note 7 .\n\nInvestments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred.  Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value.  When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's  financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment.  Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.

This reflects a financial strategy where rising discount rates helped reduce the burden of long-term liabilities. In contrast, COP used present value calculations to estimate fair values for oil and gas properties during acquisitions, incorporating market-based discount rates as part of a broader set of assumptions to determine asset valuations. This reveals that COP relies on present value techniques not to reduce liabilities but to estimate asset fair values under acquisition accounting, aligning with FASB ASC Topic 805.

          "chunk_text": "Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips experienced a $1,113 million decrease in exploration expenses in 2021, partly due to lower dry hole expenses in Alaska and the absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses from 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia. This indicates that dry hole expenses had a significant negative impact on COP's exploration costs in prior years. In contrast, ExxonMobil treats exploration expenses as part of its Capital and Exploration Expenditures (Capex), which includes its share of similar costs for equity companies, indicating a more integrated approach to tracking and managing exploration risk within broader capital investment decisions.",

This trend suggests a decline in CVX's debt servicing capacity in 2023 despite strong income before tax, as its total financing interest and debt costs remained relatively stable at $617 million. The fact that COP also reports the interest coverage ratio in its capital resources and liquidity section indicates that this metric is a key financial indicator for assessing solvency and creditworthiness in the energy sector. However, without COP's specific ratio values, a direct comparison is not possible, but the shared emphasis on this metric implies it's critical for evaluating financial risk in the industry.",

Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobil's separate planning process. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\nActions needed to advance ExxonMobil's 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company's G lobal Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil's business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect  investment  decisions  made  by  Ex x onMobil  or  its  affiliates.  Individual  projects  or  opportunities  may  advance  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including availability of stable and supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the Company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.\n\nThe term 'project' as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission and other new business opportunities, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, carbon materials, and lithium. ExxonMobil's reportable segments are Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Where applicable, ExxonMobil voluntarily discloses additional U.S., Non-U.S., and regional splits to help investors better understand the Company's operations. TM\n\nThe Company is organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions consists of Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Low Carbon Solutions is included in Corporate and Financing as the business continues to mature through commercialization and deployment of technology.  The businesses are supported by centralized service-delivery groups, including Global Projects, Technology and Engineering, Global Operations and Sustainability, Global Trading, Supply Chain, and Global Business Solutions.\n\nExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new supplies of reliable and affordable lower-emission energy and other critical products. The Company's integrated business model, with significant  investments  in  Upstream,  Energy  Products,  Chemical  Products,  and  Specialty  Products  segments  and  Low  Carbon  Solutions  businesses,  generally reduces the Corporation's risk from changes in commodity prices. While commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on a short-term basis, ExxonMobil's investment decisions are grounded on fundamentals reflected in our long-term business outlook, and use a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities which target a low cost of supply to ensure long-term competitiveness. The annual Corporate Plan process establishes the economic assumptions used for evaluating investments and sets operating and capital objectives. The G lobal Outlook (Outlook), developed annually, is the foundation for the Corporate Plan assumptions. Price ranges for crude oil and natural gas, including price differentials, refinery and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing, and foreign currency exchange rates are part of the Corporate Plan assumptions developed annually. Corporate Plan volume projections are based on individual field production profiles, which are also updated at least annually. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. All major investments are reappraised to ensure we learn from our decisions, and the development and execution of the project. Lessons learned are incorporated in future projects.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "The $4 million actuarial assumption review contributed to XOM's adjusted earnings as a 'Notable Item' within the $22 million increase in underwriting and insurance adjustments, which also included favorable refinements to insurance liabilities in Chile and Mexico. This shows a specific link between actuarial reviews and earnings adjustments. In contrast, CVX disclosed that insurance contracts are included in its 'Other' asset class under Level 3 fair value hierarchy, indicating a different treatment where insurance-related assets are held rather than directly impacting earnings. Thus, while XOM's actuarial adjustments flow through earnings, CVX's insurance contracts are positioned as part of its asset portfolio.",

Meanwhile, both Chevron and ConocoPhillips assume a 6.5% initial health care cost trend rate for pre-65 retirees, with ConocoPhillips planning for a gradual decline to 5% by 2028.

ConocoPhillips, while not providing a specific percentage, indicated that 170 million barrels of U.S. reserve increases in 2023 were driven by extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins, with continued development spending focused on converting these reserves over time. Both companies are prioritizing unconventional plays, but Chevron provides more specific metrics on conversion efficiency, while ConocoPhillips emphasizes geographic diversification and long-term development planning.",

Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

The remaining extensions and discoveries were driven by the continued development planned in the other geographic regions, including Canada, Lower 48 unconventional plays, and Alaska.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves were driven by the ongoing development of our assets. Approximately 75 percent of the transfers were from the development of our Lower 48 unconventional plays. The remainder of transfers were from development across the other geographic regions.\n\nAt both December 31, 2024 and 2023, our PUDs represented 35 percent of total proved reserves. Costs incurred for the year ended December 31, 2024, relating to the development of PUDs were $9.4 billion. A portion of our costs incurred each year relates to development projects where the PUDs will be converted to proved developed reserves in future years.\n\nAt the end of 2024, approximately 88 percent of total PUDs were under development or scheduled for development within five years of initial disclosure, i ncluding all of our Lower 48 PUDs. The PUDs to be developed beyond five years are in the Willow project in Alaska, a development that is currently underway with production anticipated in 2029 due to its large scale and remote location, as well as in major development areas which are currently producing and l ocated in Canada and in our equity affiliate in Australia.",

      "answer": "Chevron (CVX) experienced a $31.953 billion net change in the present value of reserves in 2020, significantly lowering the total from $100.547 billion to $58.537 billion. This decline coincided with a reduction in the expected life of financial instruments from 4.3\u20135.9 years in 2020 to 4.2\u20135.4 years in 2021, suggesting a compressed timeline for asset value realization. Exxon (XOM), in contrast, uses the straight-line depreciation method for certain upstream assets when the economic life of the asset does not align with the underlying reserves. This approach allows for more predictable and evenly distributed expense recognition over the asset's useful life, potentially offering XOM more financial stability during periods of sharp reserve valuation declines compared to CVX\u2019s unit-of-production method, which fluctuates with production volumes and reserve estimates.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe  Corporation  excludes  from  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  certain  sales  and  value-added  taxes  imposed  on  and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for  which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  that  arise  from  existing  assets,  liabilities,  firm  commitments  and  forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative.  All  gains  and  losses  from  derivative  instruments  for  which  the  Corporation  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil,  products  and  merchandise  inventories  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  current  market  value  or  cost  (generally  determined under the last-in, first-out method - LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and  indirectly  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventory  to  its  existing  condition  and  location.  Selling  expenses  and  general  and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this  method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well  and  where  the  Corporation  is  making  sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production  method  or  the  straight-line  method,  which  is  based  on  estimated  asset  service  life  taking  obsolescence  into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas  that  are  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  using  current  operating  methods.  Under  the  unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  unit-of-production  method  does  not  result  in  an  equitable  allocation  of  cost  over  the  economic  life  of  an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips recorded a $50 million before-tax expense in 2020 related to dry hole costs and leasehold impairments at the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which was removed from its development plans. This absence of Kamunsu-related costs in 2021 contributed to lower exploration expenses and positively impacted its 2021 net income by reducing costs by $50 million year-over-year. In contrast, ExxonMobil maintained a consistent focus on managing capital and exploration expenditures (Capex) as part of its broader strategy to preserve financial strength and support long-term shareholder value, even amid fluctuating commodity prices and litigation risks. This contrast reflects differing risk tolerance and exploration prioritization between the two companies during the same period.",

          "chunk_text": "\nManagement views the Corporation's financial strength to be a competitive advantage of strategic importance. The Corporation's financial position gives it the opportunity to access the world's capital markets across a range of market conditions, and enables the Corporation to take on large, long-term capital commitments in the pursuit of maximizing shareholder value.\n\nIndustry  conditions  in  2020  led  to  lower  realized  prices  for  the  Corporation's  products  which  resulted  in  substantially  lower earnings and operating cash flow in comparison to 2019. The Corporation took steps to strengthen its liquidity in 2020, including issuing $23.2 billion of long-term debt and implementing significant capital and operating cost reductions. The Corporation ended 2020 with $67.6 billion in total debt.\n\nStronger prices and margins improved the Corporation's financial results in 2021. The Corporation reduced debt by $19.9 billion and ended the year with $47.7 billion in total debt.\n\n## Litigation and Other Contingencies\n\nAs discussed in Note 16, a variety of claims have been made against ExxonMobil and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. Based on a consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances, the Corporation does not believe the ultimate outcome of any currently pending lawsuit against ExxonMobil will have a material adverse effect upon the Corporation's operations, financial condition, or financial statements taken as a whole. There are no events or uncertainties beyond those already included in reported financial information that would indicate a material change in future operating results or financial condition. Refer to Note 16 for additional information on legal proceedings and other contingencies.\n\n## CAPITAL AND EXPLORATION EXPENDITURES\n\nCapital and exploration expenditures (Capex) represents the combined total of additions at cost to property, plant and equipment, and exploration expenses on a before-tax basis from the Consolidated Statement of Income. ExxonMobil's Capex includes its share of similar costs for equity companies. Capex excludes assets acquired in nonmonetary exchanges, the value of ExxonMobil shares used to acquire assets, and depreciation on the cost of exploration support equipment and facilities recorded to property, plant and equipment  when  acquired.  While  ExxonMobil's  management  is  responsible  for  all  investments  and  elements  of  net  income, particular focus is placed on managing the controllable aspects of this group of expenditures.\n\n",

      "answer": "Chevron experienced an increase in pension obligations in 2020 due to lower discount rates, which increased the present value of expected benefit payments, as noted in their 2021 and 2020 benefit obligation figures of $7,278 and $4,979 million, respectively. This aligns with the principle that lower discount rates increase present values, a concept also used by ConocoPhillips in valuing oil and gas properties through discounted cash flow analysis, where assumptions like discount rates significantly affect fair value estimates. Thus, both companies are impacted by the sensitivity of present value calculations to discount rate changes, though applied in different contexts\u2014pension obligations for Chevron and asset valuation for ConocoPhillips.",

          "chunk_text": "## Business Combination-Valuation of Oil and Gas Properties\n\nFor recent transactions, management applied the principles of acquisition accounting under FASB ASC Topic 805 'Business Combinations' and allocated the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  Estimating the fair values involved  making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties.  Management utilized a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and engaged third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates.\n\nSignificant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market -based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition.  When estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.\n\nThe assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ. See Note 3 .\n\n## Impairments\n\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration  in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group.  If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans.  If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the determination is made.  Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a field-by-field basis for E&amp;P assets.  Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.\n\nThe expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review.  Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 6 and Note 7 .\n\nInvestments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred.  Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value.  When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's  financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment.  Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.  Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.  See the 'APLNG' section of Note 4 .",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe  Corporation  excludes  from  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  certain  sales  and  value-added  taxes  imposed  on  and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for  which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  that  arise  from  existing  assets,  liabilities,  firm  commitments  and  forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative.  All  gains  and  losses  from  derivative  instruments  for  which  the  Corporation  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil,  products  and  merchandise  inventories  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  current  market  value  or  cost  (generally  determined under the last-in, first-out method - LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and  indirectly  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventory  to  its  existing  condition  and  location.  Selling  expenses  and  general  and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this  method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well  and  where  the  Corporation  is  making  sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production  method  or  the  straight-line  method,  which  is  based  on  estimated  asset  service  life  taking  obsolescence  into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas  that  are  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  using  current  operating  methods.  Under  the  unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  unit-of-production  method  does  not  result  in  an  equitable  allocation  of  cost  over  the  economic  life  of  an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.",

      "answer": "CVX added 119 million barrels of oil equivalent in natural gas reserves through extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins in 2024, contributing to its overall proved reserves. These reserves are part of a larger category that includes proved undeveloped reserves, which COP reported increased from 2,334 million BOE at the end of 2023 to 2,697 million BOE at the end of 2024, with revisions adding 535 million BOE and extensions/discoveries contributing 281 million BOE. This suggests that while CVX's basin-specific additions reflect active reserve growth, COP's overall proved undeveloped reserves grew even more significantly, indicating differing reserve development strategies or discovery outcomes between the two companies.",

          "chunk_text": "Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

      "question": "How did the impact of asset sales on Chevron's liquidity compare to ExxonMobil's gains from identified items in 2024, particularly in light of Chevron's inability to realize anticipated asset sale proceeds and ExxonMobil's $415 million gain from asset sales?",
      "answer": "Chevron expressed concern in 2024 about its inability to realize anticipated cost savings and asset sales during periods of low commodity prices, which could negatively affect its liquidity and credit ratings. In contrast, ExxonMobil reported a $415 million gain from asset sales in 2024 as part of its 'Identified Items,' which contributed positively to its financial performance. This contrast highlights how ExxonMobil's asset divestiture strategy provided a measurable financial benefit during the year, whereas Chevron faced risks that such measures might not materialize as planned, potentially leaving it more exposed to market volatility and liquidity constraints.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 Asset Sales: Chevron indicated that extended low commodity prices could prevent it from realizing anticipated asset sales, which are intended to compensate for downturns and could negatively impact liquidity.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of C ontents\n\ngrowth,  including  low  or  negative  growth;  industry  production  and  inventory  levels;  technology  advancements,  including  those  in  pursuit  of  a  lower  carbon economy; production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers; weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control; competing fuel prices; geopolitical risks; the pace of energy transition; customer and consumer preferences and the use of substitutes; and governmental regulations, policies and other actions regarding the development of oil and gas reserves, as well as greenhouse gas emissions and climate change. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business, including our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, transferred liabilities, including for decommissioning of previously divested assets, have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently defaults on the assumed transferred liabilities (e.g., bankruptcy). In addition, ex tended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity  of  the  company's  suppliers,  vendors,  partners  and  equity  affiliates  upon  which  the  company's  own  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition depend.\n\nThe scope of Chevron's business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful  in  replacing  the  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  it  produces  with  good  prospects  for  future  organic  opportunities  or  through  acquisitions,  ex ploration  or technology, the company's business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; technology advancements; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.\n\nThe company's operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company's operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, and other forms of severe weather; wildfires; ambient temperature increases; sea level rise; war or other military conflicts such as the conflict in the Middle East and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine; accidents; civil unrest; political events; fires; earthquakes; system failures; cyber threats; terrorist acts; and epidemic or pandemic diseases, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\n\nChevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital  investment  reviews  and  decisions  incorporate  potential  ranges  of  physical  risks  such  as  storm  severity  and  frequency,  sea  level  rise,  air  and  water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\nCyberattacks and events affecting Chevron's operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company's information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. The cyber risk landscape changes over time due to a variety of internal and external factors,",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business, including our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, transferred liabilities, including for decommissioning of previously divested assets, have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently defaults on the assumed transferred liabilities (e.g., bankruptcy). In addition, ex tended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity  of  the  company's  suppliers,  vendors,  partners  and  equity  affiliates  upon  which  the  company's  own  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition depend.\n\nThe scope of Chevron's business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful  in  replacing  the  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  it  produces  with  good  prospects  for  future  organic  opportunities  or  through  acquisitions,  ex ploration  or technology, the company's business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; technology advancements; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.\n\nThe company's operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company's operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, and other forms of severe weather; wildfires; ambient temperature increases; sea level rise; war or other military conflicts such as the conflict in the Middle East and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine; accidents; civil unrest; political events; fires; earthquakes; system failures; cyber threats; terrorist acts; and epidemic or pandemic diseases, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\n\nChevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital  investment  reviews  and  decisions  incorporate  potential  ranges  of  physical  risks  such  as  storm  severity  and  frequency,  sea  level  rise,  air  and  water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\nCyberattacks and events affecting Chevron's operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company's information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. The cyber risk landscape changes over time due to a variety of internal and external factors,",

      "answer": "Chevron's (CVX) $296 million international pension obligation in 2022 could potentially increase if it applied ConocoPhillips' (COP) lower 3.40% rate of compensation increase. According to the UPS disclosures, compensation increases directly influence the actuarial valuation of international pension benefits, with higher rates typically leading to higher future liabilities. Since COP's 3.40% rate is lower than the 3.17% used by UPS for international pensions, applying this to CVX's $296 million obligation would likely result in an upward adjustment in liability, reflecting the sensitivity of pension obligations to compensation growth assumptions.",

        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Rate of Compensation Increase: COP applies a 3.40% rate of compensation increase for its pension benefits, as disclosed in its 2022 10-K filing.",

        "Hop 3: International Pension Benefits \u2190 CVX: Chevron (CVX) reported an international pension benefit obligation of $296 million in 2022, indicating the scale of liability that would be influenced by changes in compensation increase assumptions."

      "answer": "XOM's NGL realization dropped from $87.25 per barrel in 2022 to $69.85 in 2023, a decline of $17.40 per barrel. COP's NGL price also declined from $37.70 per barrel in 2022 to $26.13 in 2023, a larger drop of $11.57 per barrel. While both companies experienced downward pricing pressure in their NGL segments, XOM's decline was more severe in absolute terms, suggesting that XOM may have faced additional market or contractual factors affecting its realized prices beyond general NGL market trends observed by COP.",

        "Hop 2: NGL Realization \u2192 NGL Price: The decline in XOM's NGL realization suggests broader downward pressure in the NGL market, which can be cross-validated with observed NGL price trends from industry data or peer disclosures.",
        "Hop 3: NGL Price \u2190 COP: COP reported a drop in NGL prices from $37.70 to $26.13 per barrel over the same period, confirming a market-wide price decline, though less severe than XOM's realization drop."

      "answer": "XOM's capital deployment in 2022 was heavily influenced by project progression timelines, with proved reserves only recorded for projects receiving significant funding commitments and deployment subject to factors like regulatory approvals and reservoir performance. Specifically, XOM had 30 projects with capitalized exploratory well costs, of which 13 had recent or planned drilling activity while 17 were progressing toward development. In contrast, COP reported $4,440 million in total development spending for 2021, with significant allocations across Lower 48 ($2,461 million), Alaska ($949 million), and international regions like Asia Pacific/Middle East ($433 million). This reveals that while XOM's capital deployment was conditional on multi-stage project timelines and approvals, COP demonstrated concrete development spending across diverse geographies in the same period.",

However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

      "answer": "Chevron allocated approximately $5.5 billion of its $8.2 billion total 2024 investments in oil and gas producing activities to the United States, focusing on development in the Midland and Delaware basins, the Gulf of America, and the DJ basin. These expenditures targeted the advancement of proved undeveloped reserves, which stood at 624 million BOE for Chevron at year-end 2024. In contrast, Exxon reported proved undeveloped natural gas reserves of 231 billion cubic feet in the 'Other Americas' region, as part of a broader reserves portfolio that included 633 million barrels of crude oil in the same category. This suggests Chevron is directing significant capital toward converting proved undeveloped reserves into production in core U.S. basins, while Exxon maintains a more diversified reserve base across the Americas with a notable undeveloped gas position.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

In contrast, CVX faced production risks from external factors such as low commodity prices, geopolitical instability, and operational disruptions, which could materially impact its upstream earnings and proved reserves.

Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business, including our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, transferred liabilities, including for decommissioning of previously divested assets, have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently defaults on the assumed transferred liabilities (e.g., bankruptcy). In addition, ex tended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity  of  the  company's  suppliers,  vendors,  partners  and  equity  affiliates  upon  which  the  company's  own  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition depend.\n\nThe scope of Chevron's business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful  in  replacing  the  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  it  produces  with  good  prospects  for  future  organic  opportunities  or  through  acquisitions,  ex ploration  or technology, the company's business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; technology advancements; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.\n\nThe company's operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company's operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, and other forms of severe weather; wildfires; ambient temperature increases; sea level rise; war or other military conflicts such as the conflict in the Middle East and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine; accidents; civil unrest; political events; fires; earthquakes; system failures; cyber threats; terrorist acts; and epidemic or pandemic diseases, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\n\nChevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital  investment  reviews  and  decisions  incorporate  potential  ranges  of  physical  risks  such  as  storm  severity  and  frequency,  sea  level  rise,  air  and  water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\nCyberattacks and events affecting Chevron's operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company's information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. The cyber risk landscape changes over time due to a variety of internal and external factors,",

          "chunk_text": "Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

However, the downstream segment faces margin pressures due to the volatility of natural gas prices, which directly affect refining and petrochemical profitability. ExxonMobil\u2019s reported natural gas realization of $4.26 per thousand cubic feet in 2023 reflects an industry-wide decline from $7.48 in 2022, validating Chevron\u2019s concern over margin volatility and reinforcing the need for cost discipline and asset optimization in both upstream and downstream operations.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' 2021 net income was positively impacted by the absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which had previously contributed to exploration costs in 2020. Specifically, in 2020, COP recorded a before-tax expense of $50 million related to dry hole costs and impairment for Kamunsu East Field. In contrast, Chevron's 2021 exploration expense was $549 million, a significant decrease from its 2020 exploration expense of $1,537 million, indicating improved cost management by Chevron in exploration activities. This comparison highlights differing trends in exploration cost control between the two companies, with COP benefiting from the removal of a prior expense driver and CVX showing a marked reduction in exploration spending.",

See Note 3 .\n- A gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020.\n- Lower exploration expenses due to:\n- o Absence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after  -tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset.\n- o Lower dry hole expenses.\n- o Absence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska.\n- o Absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans.\n- Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices.\n- Contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments.\n- An after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a FID bonus associated with our Australia -West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3 .\n- Lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7 .\n\nThese increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:\n\n- Higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes.\n- Higher DD&amp;A expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021.\n- Absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our Australia-West divestiture completed in May 2020.\n- Restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the Concho and Shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.",

      "answer": "XOM's gross operated wells increased from 18,518 in 2023 to 25,610 in 2024, a rise of 7,092 wells. Chevron's net wells are derived from the sum of its ownership interest in gross wells, meaning the change in XOM's gross well count implies a proportional potential change in net wells for Chevron, depending on its ownership share. Given Chevron's ownership interest definition, if Chevron maintained a consistent ownership percentage across those wells, its net well count would also have increased, though the exact figure depends on its stake in the additional gross wells.",

        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Gross Wells: XOM disclosed 18,518 gross operated wells in 2023 and 25,610 in 2024, showing an increase of 7,092 wells.",

      "answer": "The expected life of upstream assets increased from 2020 to 2021, as shown in the 4.3\u20135.9 year range in 2020 shifting to a 4.2\u20135.4 year range in 2021. For XOM, this change would have affected depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expenses in 2022 because they use the unit-of-production method for upstream assets, which ties depreciation directly to reserves and production levels. A longer expected life could reduce the unit DD&A rate if reserves are unchanged, potentially lowering expenses. For CVX, the increase in expected life coincided with a significant $70,338 million net change in the present value of reserves in 2021, which would have influenced 2022 reserve valuations and DD&A calculations. This shift likely resulted in lower depletion rates and higher asset values for CVX in 2022 due to the extended economic life of their reserves.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Expected Life: XOM uses the unit-of-production method for upstream assets, where depreciation is tied to the estimated economic life and recoverable reserves of those assets. A change in expected life directly impacts the depreciation rate and expense.",

This change would affect how companies like XOM and CVX calculate depreciation and asset valuation.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe  Corporation  excludes  from  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  certain  sales  and  value-added  taxes  imposed  on  and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for  which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  that  arise  from  existing  assets,  liabilities,  firm  commitments  and  forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative.  All  gains  and  losses  from  derivative  instruments  for  which  the  Corporation  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil,  products  and  merchandise  inventories  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  current  market  value  or  cost  (generally  determined under the last-in, first-out method - LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and  indirectly  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventory  to  its  existing  condition  and  location.  Selling  expenses  and  general  and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this  method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well  and  where  the  Corporation  is  making  sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production  method  or  the  straight-line  method,  which  is  based  on  estimated  asset  service  life  taking  obsolescence  into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas  that  are  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  using  current  operating  methods.  Under  the  unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  unit-of-production  method  does  not  result  in  an  equitable  allocation  of  cost  over  the  economic  life  of  an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.",

      "answer": "In 2024, XOM reported 176 billion cubic feet of natural gas within its proved developed reserves in the Other Americas region. Over the same period, CVX saw an overall increase in its natural gas reserves driven by extensions and discoveries in the U.S., particularly in the Midland and Delaware basins (119 million barrels) and the DJ basin (45 million barrels). This suggests that while both companies are focusing on upstream development, XOM's natural gas exposure in Other Americas is more mature and developed, whereas CVX is actively expanding its natural gas reserves through exploration and development in shale basins. The contrast in natural gas reserve trends highlights differing upstream strategies: XOM appears to be maintaining developed reserves, while CVX is aggressively growing its reserves through new discoveries and development.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

          "chunk_text": "Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States.

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' contribution to natural gas production through its Alaska segment compare to ExxonMobil's total natural gas production in 2023, considering Alaska's relatively smaller share of COP's overall output?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' Alaska segment contributed 2% of COP\u2019s consolidated natural gas production in 2023, which, based on COP\u2019s total natural gas production of 3,738 thousand oil-equivalent barrels daily (as reported in its 2023 10-K), equates to approximately 74.76 thousand barrels of natural gas production per day from Alaska. In comparison, ExxonMobil reported total natural gas production of 7,734 million cubic feet daily in 2023. This shows that while COP's Alaska operations contribute a small fraction of its overall production, the volume still represents a meaningful contribution relative to XOM's much larger total natural gas output.",

      "question": "How did the decline in Chevron's (CVX) oil and gas reserve values between 2019 and 2020 influence the industry-standard expected life assumptions in the energy sector, and how does Exxon's (XOM) depreciation policy reflect these updated asset lifespan expectations?",
      "answer": "Chevron's (CVX) oil and gas reserve values declined significantly between 2019 ($100,547 million total present value) and 2020 ($58,537 million total present value), largely due to negative net changes driven by price fluctuations and cost adjustments (-$85,713 million in 2020). This decline reflects broader sector pressures that likely contributed to a downward revision in the industry's expected life assumptions for oil and gas assets. As seen in the data, the weighted-average expected life for such assets dropped from 4.2\u20135.9 years in 2019 to 4.2\u20135.4 years by 2021, indicating a narrowing outlook. Exxon (XOM) responded by applying depreciation methods\u2014primarily the unit-of-production method\u2014aligned with these revised reserve life expectations, ensuring that capitalized costs are amortized based on proved reserves over their economically viable lifespans. This aligns with XOM\u2019s policy of using straight-line depreciation only in cases where asset life does not correlate with reserve depletion, suggesting a strategic shift toward shorter-term asset utilization models in response to industry valuation pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 2019: Chevron's oil and gas reserve values declined from $100,547 million in 2019 to $58,537 million in 2020, driven by a -$85,713 million net change in 2020 due to price and cost revisions.",
        "Hop 2: 2019 \u2192 Expected Life: Industry-standard expected life assumptions for assets fell from 4.2\u20135.9 years in 2019 to 4.2\u20135.4 years by 2021, showing a narrowing of projected asset lifespans.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe  Corporation  excludes  from  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  certain  sales  and  value-added  taxes  imposed  on  and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for  which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  that  arise  from  existing  assets,  liabilities,  firm  commitments  and  forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative.  All  gains  and  losses  from  derivative  instruments  for  which  the  Corporation  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil,  products  and  merchandise  inventories  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  current  market  value  or  cost  (generally  determined under the last-in, first-out method - LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and  indirectly  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventory  to  its  existing  condition  and  location.  Selling  expenses  and  general  and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this  method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well  and  where  the  Corporation  is  making  sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production  method  or  the  straight-line  method,  which  is  based  on  estimated  asset  service  life  taking  obsolescence  into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas  that  are  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  using  current  operating  methods.  Under  the  unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  unit-of-production  method  does  not  result  in  an  equitable  allocation  of  cost  over  the  economic  life  of  an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

          "chunk_text": "Our ability to successfully execute on our plans to reduce operational GHG emissions intensity is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such reductions may be costly and challenging to achieve.\n\nOur framework for managing climate-related business risk is set out in our Climate Risk Strategy, which describes our strategic flexibility, approach to reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity, technology choices and engagement efforts. Among other things, we have set near- and medium-term GHG intensity reduction targets, as well as targets around flaring and methane. Our ability to achieve the stated targets, goals and ambitions within the Climate Risk Strategy's framework is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including government policies and markets, acceptance of carbon capture technologies, development of markets and potential permitting and regulatory changes, all of which may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans. In addition, the pace of development of effective emissions measurement and abatement technologies, and the actual pace of development may be inadequate, or the technologies actually developed may be insufficient to allow us to achieve our stated targets, goals and ambitions.\n\nFurthermore, executing our Climate Risk Strategy could be costly, is likely to encounter unforeseen obstacles, will proceed at varying paces and may be accomplished in a manner that we cannot predict at this time. We expect to be required to purchase emission credits and/or offsets in the future. There may be an insufficient supply of offsets, and we could incur increasingly greater expenses related to our purchase of such offsets. Even if we are able to acquire an adequate amount of such offsets at satisfactory prices, investors, regulators or other third parties may not perceive this practice as an acceptable means of achieving our emission reduction goals. As advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise aspects of our Climate Risk Strategy. We may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end-of-field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets. Even if we meet our goals, our efforts may be characterized as insufficient.\n\nIn early 2021, we established a multidisciplinary Low Carbon Technologies organization with the remit of supporting our emissions reduction objectives, understanding the alternative energy landscape and prioritizing opportunities for future competitive investment. Such potential investments may expose us to numerous financial, legal, operational, reputational and other risks. While we perform a thorough analysis on these investments, the related technologies and markets are at early stages of development and we do not yet know what rate of return we will achieve, if any, and we may suspend our evaluation or investment i f we determine that applicable markets have not developed at the pace required to support further investment. For example, as a result of the hydrogen and ammonia markets not developing at a pace required to support further investment, in 2024 we decided to suspend our evaluation of a low-carbon ammonia production facility on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, we may not be able to scale potential investments. The success of our low-carbon strategy will depend in part upon the cooperation of government agencies, the support of stakeholders, the development of relevant markets for low carbon fuels, our ability to research and forecast potential investments, willingness of industry partners to collaborate and our ability to apply our existing strengths and expertise to new technologies, projects and markets.\n\nEstimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves are imprecise and may be subject to revision, and any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.\n\nOur proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management's best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. Such volumes cannot be directly measured, and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur i mpairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and commodity prices.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

          "chunk_text": "Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "CVX's 4.5% rate of compensation increase assumption for U.S. pension benefits (from 2022 disclosures) directly influences actuarial projections of future pension liabilities, as higher assumed wage growth leads to larger benefit payouts over time. This assumption is paired with a 2.8% discount rate, which affects the present value of those future liabilities. COP's 2022 disclosure of $369 million in U.S. pension benefits suggests a different liability profile, though COP\u2019s specific compensation increase assumption isn't disclosed. Analysts would need to infer whether COP\u2019s undisclosed rate aligns with industry norms like CVX\u2019s 4.5% or UPS\u2019s 4.29%, which would help assess the sustainability and funding adequacy of COP\u2019s pension obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

Investment decisions are made on the basis of ExxonMobil's separate planning process. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\nActions needed to advance ExxonMobil's 2030 greenhouse gas emission-reductions plans are incorporated into its medium-term business plans, which are updated annually. The reference case for planning beyond 2030 is based on the Company's G lobal Outlook (Outlook) research and publication. The Outlook is reflective of the existing global policy environment and an assumption of increasing policy stringency and technology improvement to 2050. Current trends for policy stringency and development of lower-emission solutions are not yet on a pathway to achieve net-zero by 2050. As such, the Outlook does not project the degree of required future policy and technology advancement and deployment for the world, or ExxonMobil, to meet net zero by 2050. As future policies and technology advancements emerge, they will be incorporated into the Outlook, and ExxonMobil's business plans will be updated accordingly. References to projects or opportunities may not reflect  investment  decisions  made  by  Ex x onMobil  or  its  affiliates.  Individual  projects  or  opportunities  may  advance  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including availability of stable and supportive policy, permitting, technological advancement for cost-effective abatement, insights from the Company planning process, and alignment with our partners and other stakeholders. Capital investment guidance in lower-emission investments is based on our corporate plan; however, actual investment levels will be subject to the availability of the opportunity set, public policy support, and focused on returns.\n\nThe term 'project' as used in this report can refer to a variety of different activities and does not necessarily have the same meaning as in any government payment transparency reports.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for, and production of, crude oil and natural gas; manufacture, trade, transport and sale of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products, petrochemicals, and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission and other new business opportunities, including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, lower-emission fuels, Proxxima systems, carbon materials, and lithium. ExxonMobil's reportable segments are Upstream, Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Where applicable, ExxonMobil voluntarily discloses additional U.S., Non-U.S., and regional splits to help investors better understand the Company's operations. TM\n\nThe Company is organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions consists of Energy Products, Chemical Products, and Specialty Products. Low Carbon Solutions is included in Corporate and Financing as the business continues to mature through commercialization and deployment of technology.  The businesses are supported by centralized service-delivery groups, including Global Projects, Technology and Engineering, Global Operations and Sustainability, Global Trading, Supply Chain, and Global Business Solutions.\n\nExxonMobil, with its resource base, financial strength, disciplined investment approach and technology portfolio, is well-positioned to participate in substantial investments to develop new supplies of reliable and affordable lower-emission energy and other critical products. The Company's integrated business model, with significant  investments  in  Upstream,  Energy  Products,  Chemical  Products,  and  Specialty  Products  segments  and  Low  Carbon  Solutions  businesses,  generally reduces the Corporation's risk from changes in commodity prices. While commodity prices depend on supply and demand and may be volatile on a short-term basis, ExxonMobil's investment decisions are grounded on fundamentals reflected in our long-term business outlook, and use a disciplined approach in selecting and pursuing the most attractive investment opportunities which target a low cost of supply to ensure long-term competitiveness. The annual Corporate Plan process establishes the economic assumptions used for evaluating investments and sets operating and capital objectives. The G lobal Outlook (Outlook), developed annually, is the foundation for the Corporate Plan assumptions. Price ranges for crude oil and natural gas, including price differentials, refinery and chemical margins, volumes, development and operating costs, including greenhouse gas emissions pricing, and foreign currency exchange rates are part of the Corporate Plan assumptions developed annually. Corporate Plan volume projections are based on individual field production profiles, which are also updated at least annually. Major investment opportunities are evaluated over a range of potential market conditions. All major investments are reappraised to ensure we learn from our decisions, and the development and execution of the project. Lessons learned are incorporated in future projects.",

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "question": "How did the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on COP's 2023 financial performance compare to the effect on XOM's Adjusted Earnings, given that both companies operate internationally?",
      "answer": "Foreign currency fluctuations had a net negative impact of $13 million on XOM's Adjusted Earnings in 2023, primarily due to the weakening of the Egyptian pound and Turkish lira against the U.S. dollar. In contrast, COP reported a net foreign currency transaction gain of $70 million for 2023, driven by regional variances such as gains in Asia Pacific and Corporate and Other, despite losses in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa. While both companies are exposed to foreign exchange risks due to their international operations, the effect was negative for XOM and positive for COP, highlighting differing regional currency exposures and hedging strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Adjusted Earnings: XOM's Adjusted Earnings for 2023 were reduced by $13 million due to foreign currency fluctuations, specifically from the weakening of the Egyptian pound and Turkish lira.",
        "Hop 2: Adjusted Earnings \u2192 Foreign Currency: Foreign currency fluctuations are a recognized factor affecting Adjusted Earnings, with specific regional impacts outlined in the analysis of earnings drivers.",
        "Hop 3: Foreign Currency \u2190 COP: COP reported a net foreign currency transaction gain of $70 million in 2023, with mixed regional impacts including gains in Asia Pacific and Corporate and Other, offsetting losses in other regions."

      "question": "Given ConocoPhillips' exposure to reserve estimate revisions and Exxon's 176 billion cubic feet of proved developed natural gas reserves in the Other Americas region, how might their respective reserve management strategies affect short-term production decisions and asset valuations in a volatile commodity price environment?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips acknowledges that reserve estimates are imprecise and subject to revision based on factors like commodity prices and regulatory changes, which introduces uncertainty in asset valuations and production planning. Exxon, by contrast, reports 176 billion cubic feet of proved developed natural gas reserves in the Other Americas region, indicating a more defined short-term production outlook for these assets. In a volatile price environment, ConocoPhillips may face greater risk of reserve revisions and potential impairments, while Exxon\u2019s proved developed reserves suggest a more stable production base that could support near-term cash flow visibility and asset valuation stability.",

        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Natural Gas Reserves: ConocoPhillips highlights that its natural gas reserve estimates are subject to revision due to uncertainties in geoscience data, commodity prices, and regulatory changes, which could lead to asset impairments.",

          "chunk_text": "Our ability to successfully execute on our plans to reduce operational GHG emissions intensity is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such reductions may be costly and challenging to achieve.\n\nOur framework for managing climate-related business risk is set out in our Climate Risk Strategy, which describes our strategic flexibility, approach to reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity, technology choices and engagement efforts. Among other things, we have set near- and medium-term GHG intensity reduction targets, as well as targets around flaring and methane. Our ability to achieve the stated targets, goals and ambitions within the Climate Risk Strategy's framework is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including government policies and markets, acceptance of carbon capture technologies, development of markets and potential permitting and regulatory changes, all of which may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans. In addition, the pace of development of effective emissions measurement and abatement technologies, and the actual pace of development may be inadequate, or the technologies actually developed may be insufficient to allow us to achieve our stated targets, goals and ambitions.\n\nFurthermore, executing our Climate Risk Strategy could be costly, is likely to encounter unforeseen obstacles, will proceed at varying paces and may be accomplished in a manner that we cannot predict at this time. We expect to be required to purchase emission credits and/or offsets in the future. There may be an insufficient supply of offsets, and we could incur increasingly greater expenses related to our purchase of such offsets. Even if we are able to acquire an adequate amount of such offsets at satisfactory prices, investors, regulators or other third parties may not perceive this practice as an acceptable means of achieving our emission reduction goals. As advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise aspects of our Climate Risk Strategy. We may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end-of-field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets. Even if we meet our goals, our efforts may be characterized as insufficient.\n\nIn early 2021, we established a multidisciplinary Low Carbon Technologies organization with the remit of supporting our emissions reduction objectives, understanding the alternative energy landscape and prioritizing opportunities for future competitive investment. Such potential investments may expose us to numerous financial, legal, operational, reputational and other risks. While we perform a thorough analysis on these investments, the related technologies and markets are at early stages of development and we do not yet know what rate of return we will achieve, if any, and we may suspend our evaluation or investment i f we determine that applicable markets have not developed at the pace required to support further investment. For example, as a result of the hydrogen and ammonia markets not developing at a pace required to support further investment, in 2024 we decided to suspend our evaluation of a low-carbon ammonia production facility on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, we may not be able to scale potential investments. The success of our low-carbon strategy will depend in part upon the cooperation of government agencies, the support of stakeholders, the development of relevant markets for low carbon fuels, our ability to research and forecast potential investments, willingness of industry partners to collaborate and our ability to apply our existing strengths and expertise to new technologies, projects and markets.\n\nEstimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves are imprecise and may be subject to revision, and any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.\n\nOur proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management's best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. Such volumes cannot be directly measured, and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur i mpairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and commodity prices.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

The decreases were partially offset by $200 million related to a FID bonus associated with our Australia-West divestiture, gains recognized for contingent payments associated with previous dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments and gains on sales of certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment.\n\nOther income (loss) increased $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to a gain of $1,040 million on our CVE common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million loss on those shares in 2020. See Note 5 .\n\nPurchased commodities increased 125 percent in 2021, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes.\n\nProduction and operating expenses increased $1,350 million in 2021, primarily in line with higher production volumes.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $289 million in 2021, primarily due to transaction and restructuring expenses associated with our Concho acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs.\n\nExploration expenses decreased $1,113 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of 2020 expenses including an $828 million impairment for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset, the early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska, and absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses from 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia.  2021 also saw lower dry hole expenses in Alaska.\n\nImpairments decreased $139 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment in 2021.  For additional information, see Note 7 and Note 13 .\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $880 million in 2021, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher Lower 48 sales volumes.\n\nForeign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased $50 million in 2021 due to the absence of derivative gains and other remeasurements.\n\nSee Note 17-Income Taxes for information regardin g our income tax provision and effective tax rate.",

          "chunk_text": "## Exploration\n\nAppraisal of the Willow Discovery, located 36 miles from Nuiqsut in the Bear Tooth Unit in the NPR-A, was conducted in 2020.  There was no appraisal activity in 2021. In August 2021, an Alaska federal judge vacated the U.S. government's approval granted to our planned Willow project previously approved by the BLM in October 2020.  The Department of Justice did not appeal the decision and neither did we.  We are actively supporting the BLM and Department of Interior as they conduct the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement process to address issues highlighted by the federal district court.  In the interim, we are continuing with FEED work in service of a final investment decision.\n\nThe Stony Hill 1 well located to the east of the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit within the NPR-A was plugged and abandoned in 2021 and expensed as a dry hole.\n\nA 3D seismic survey covering 234 square miles was completed in 2020 on state and federal lands.  We are currently evaluating this seismic data for future exploration opportunities.\n\nIn late 2021, the Coyote Brookian topset exploration prospect in the Kuparuk River Unit was tested with a near vertical sidetrack from an existing wellbore.  The well was fracture stimulated and will undergo well testing early in 2022 to confirm longer term deliverability.\n\n## Transportation\n\nWe transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of Trans  -Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).  We have a 29.5 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in and operate the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.\n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double -hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels, as necessary.  The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S.\n\n## Lower 48\n\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the Gulf of Mexico.  The segment is organized into the Permian and Gulf Coast and Rockies business units with a portfolio of low cost of supply, short cycle time, resource-rich unconventional plays, and conventional production from legacy assets. Based on 2021 production volumes, the Lower 48 is the company's largest segment and contributed 55 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 64 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\nIn 2021, we completed two acquisitions significantly increasing our Permian position in the Lower 48.  On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho adding complementary acreage across the Delaware and Midland basins.  On December 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Shell's Delaware Basin position adding significant Texas acreage in the Delaware Basin.  The accounting close date used for reporting purposes of the Shell transaction was December 31, 2021.  For additional information related to these acquisitions, see Note 3 .",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

      "answer": "XOM's development timelines are influenced by the 30 long-delayed exploratory projects, 17 of which are progressing toward development without recent drilling activity, potentially delaying production start-ups. Meanwhile, CVX allocated $6.498 billion to development in 2021, suggesting a more aggressive push to convert reserves into production. Given XOM's cautious approach\u2014where proved reserves are only recorded after significant funding commitments and are subject to regulatory and market factors\u2014CVX's higher and more consistent development spending could position it to bring new capacity online more rapidly, especially in regions like the Americas and Asia where both companies operate.

However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

      "question": "How did the 2021 increase in proved reserves at Kearl, driven by an improved SEC price basis, influence ExxonMobil's overall reserves position, and how does this compare to Chevron's classification and disclosure standards for proved reserves?",
      "answer": "In 2021, Kearl added approximately 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen to proved reserves due to an improved SEC price basis, significantly contributing to ExxonMobil's overall reserves position through its ownership stake in the Kearl joint venture. This increase highlights the sensitivity of reserves to commodity price assumptions. Chevron, in its 2022 disclosures, classifies proved reserves as quantities that are economically producible under existing economic conditions, aligning with SEC standards. Chevron's governance framework emphasizes that reserves estimates must meet both SEC and internal standards, and are subject to change due to data uncertainties. This comparison shows that while ExxonMobil's reserves are directly impacted by SEC price-based adjustments at assets like Kearl, Chevron maintains a structured classification system that reflects similar regulatory and economic dependencies.",

Syncrude  is  a  joint  venture  established  to  recover  shallow  deposits  of  oil  sands  using  open-pit  mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest  in  Imperial  Oil  Limited.  In  2021,  the  company's  share  of  net  production  of  synthetic  crude  oil  was  about  62  thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 55 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.\n\nKearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract  the  crude  bitumen.  Imperial  Oil  Limited  holds  a  70.96  percent  interest  in  the  joint  venture  and  ExxonMobil  Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.\n\nKearl  is  located  approximately  40  miles  north  of  Fort  McMurray,  Alberta,  Canada.  Bitumen  is  extracted  from  oil  sands  and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2021, average net production at Kearl was about 251 thousand barrels per day.\n\nDuring  2021,  approximately  2.4  billion  barrels  of  bitumen  at  Kearl  were  added  to  proved  reserves  primarily  as  a  result  of  an improved SEC price basis versus 2020.\n\n## 5.

Syncrude  is  a  joint  venture  established  to  recover  shallow  deposits  of  oil  sands  using  open-pit  mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. Imperial Oil Limited is the owner of a 25 percent interest in the joint venture. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest  in  Imperial  Oil  Limited.  In  2021,  the  company's  share  of  net  production  of  synthetic  crude  oil  was  about  62  thousand barrels per day and share of net acreage was about 55 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.\n\nKearl Operations. Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract  the  crude  bitumen.  Imperial  Oil  Limited  holds  a  70.96  percent  interest  in  the  joint  venture  and  ExxonMobil  Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. Exxon Mobil Corporation has a 69.6 percent interest in Imperial Oil Limited and a 100 percent interest in ExxonMobil Canada Properties. Kearl is comprised of six oil sands leases covering about 49 thousand acres in the Athabasca oil sands deposit.\n\nKearl  is  located  approximately  40  miles  north  of  Fort  McMurray,  Alberta,  Canada.  Bitumen  is  extracted  from  oil  sands  and processed through bitumen extraction and froth treatment trains. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is shipped to our refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. During 2021, average net production at Kearl was about 251 thousand barrels per day.\n\nDuring  2021,  approximately  2.4  billion  barrels  of  bitumen  at  Kearl  were  added  to  proved  reserves  primarily  as  a  result  of  an improved SEC price basis versus 2020.\n\n## 5.

The company classifies discovered recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting - three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial  classification  are  proved  reserves  and  two  categories  of  unproved  reserves:  probable  and  possible.  The  potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.\n\nProved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to  be  economically  producible  in  the  future  from  known  reservoirs  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.\n\nProved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.",

          "chunk_text": "## Pension Benefits\n\nThe Corporation and its affiliates sponsor about 80 defined benefit (pension) plans in over 40 countries. The Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits footnote (Note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension expense.\n\nSome  of  these  plans  (primarily  non-U.S.)  provide  pension  benefits  that  are  paid  directly  by  their  sponsoring  affiliates  out  of corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage advance funding. Book reserves are established for these plans. The portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed as services are rendered. The portion attributable to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund assets.\n\nFor funded plans, including those in the U.S., pension obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements.  These  plans  are  managed  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  governmental  authorities  and  meet  or  exceed required  funding  levels  as  measured  by  relevant  actuarial  and  government  standards  at  the  mandated  measurement  dates.  In determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes.\n\nThe Corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as necessary. All defined-benefit pension obligations, regardless  of  the  funding  status  of  the  underlying  plans,  are  fully  supported  by  the  financial  strength  of  the  Corporation  or  the respective sponsoring affiliate.\n\nPension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount  rate  for  the  benefit  obligations  and  the  long-term  rate  for  future  salary  increases.  Pension  assumptions  are  reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2021 was 5.3 percent. The 10-year and 20year actual returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively. The Corporation establishes the longterm expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $190 million before tax.\n\nDifferences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.\n\n## Litigation and Tax Contingencies\n\nA variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant,  the  Corporation  discloses  the  nature  of  the  contingency  and  where  feasible,  an  estimate  of  the  possible  loss. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16.\n\nManagement judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict. However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect on operations or financial condition. In the Corporation's experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.\n\nThe Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. The benefits of uncertain tax positions that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict. The Corporation's unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in Note 19.",

These differences in realizations reflect divergent regional production strategies: COP and XOM likely benefited from stronger gas pricing in international or premium markets (e.g., Europe at $10.01/MCF for COP), while CVX's lower realization suggests a heavier weighting toward lower-priced domestic markets such as the Lower 48 ($2.12/MCF for COP).

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' asset write-downs in the Lower 48 segment impact its natural gas production volumes in 2023 compared to ExxonMobil's reported U.S. natural gas output?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' Lower 48 segment, which contributed 76% of its consolidated natural gas production in 2023, experienced asset write-downs due to declining fair values of noncore assets. Despite these write-downs, ConocoPhillips maintained production growth through new wells in the Delaware Basin, Midland Basin, Eagle Ford, and Bakken. In contrast, ExxonMobil reported a decline in U.S. natural gas production from 2,531 MMcf/d in 2022 to 2,292 MMcf/d in 2023. This suggests that while ConocoPhillips faced asset valuation challenges, it still managed to grow production in key basins, whereas ExxonMobil experienced a reduction in its U.S. natural gas output.",

        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Lower 48 Segment: ConocoPhillips wrote down the carrying value of noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment due to declining fair values estimated via internal discounted cash flow models.",

Similarly, CVX noted that higher discount rates in 2021 led to a decrease in pension obligations, as benefit obligations are measured as the present value of expected payments discounted using high-quality fixed-income yields.

          "chunk_text": "## Business Combination-Valuation of Oil and Gas Properties\n\nFor recent transactions, management applied the principles of acquisition accounting under FASB ASC Topic 805 'Business Combinations' and allocated the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  Estimating the fair values involved  making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties.  Management utilized a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and engaged third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates.\n\nSignificant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, the pace of drilling plans, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market -based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition.  When estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.\n\nThe assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market, and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ. See Note 3 .\n\n## Impairments\n\nLong-lived assets used in operations are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration  in the future cash flows expected to be generated by an asset group.  If there is an indication the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered, a recoverability test is performed using management's assumptions for prices, volumes and future development plans.  If the sum of the undiscounted cash flows before income-taxes is less than the carrying value of the asset group, the carrying value is written down to estimated fair value and reported as an impairment in the periods in which the determination is made.  Individual assets are grouped for impairment purposes at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets-generally on a field-by-field basis for E&amp;P assets.  Because there usually is a lack of quoted market prices for long-lived assets, the fair value of impaired assets is typically determined based on the present values of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, or based on a multiple of operating cash flow validated with historical market transactions of similar assets where possible.\n\nThe expected future cash flows used for impairment reviews and related fair value calculations are based on estimated future production volumes, commodity prices, operating costs and capital decisions, considering all available evidence at the date of review.  Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment in any period. See Note 6 and Note 7 .\n\nInvestments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred.  Such evidence of a loss in value might include our inability to recover the carrying amount, the lack of sustained earnings capacity which would justify the current investment amount, or a current fair value less than the investment's carrying amount. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the investment's carrying value and its estimated fair value.  When determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary, management considers factors such as the length of time and extent of the decline, the investee's  financial condition and near-term prospects, and our ability and intention to retain our investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the market value of the investment.  Since quoted market prices are usually not available, the fair value is typically based on the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.  Differing assumptions could affect the timing and the amount of an impairment of an investment in any period.  See the 'APLNG' section of Note 4 .",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil reported a ROCE of 10.9%, calculated using its average capital employed of $222,890 million. Chevron also calculates ROCE by dividing adjusted net income by average capital employed, which reflects how each company generates earnings relative to its invested capital. The difference in ROCE highlights ExxonMobil\u2019s stronger capital efficiency compared to Chevron during that year, assuming similar capital structures and operating environments.",

        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Average Capital Employed: ExxonMobil disclosed its 2022 average capital employed as $222,890 million, a key input in calculating ROCE.",

      "question": "How do ExxonMobil's 2023 NGL realizations compare to the decline in ConocoPhillips' NGL prices, and what might explain the relationship between these two metrics given the industry's pricing dynamics?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil reported an average NGL realization of $69.85 per barrel in 2023, which combines crude oil and NGL realizations, while ConocoPhillips disclosed a significantly lower NGL price of $26.13 per barrel in the same year\u2014a drop from $37.70 in 2022. The relationship suggests that despite a notable decline in NGL prices industry-wide, as reflected in ConocoPhillips' data, ExxonMobil's integrated upstream and downstream operations may have allowed it to maintain relatively higher realizations by capturing value across the hydrocarbon chain. This divergence could be attributed to ExxonMobil\u2019s portfolio strategy, operational efficiencies, or downstream integration that mitigates some of the impacts of falling NGL prices on realized revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 NGL Price: ConocoPhillips discloses a significant drop in NGL prices from $37.70 per barrel in 2022 to $26.13 in 2023, indicating a downward pricing trend in the NGL market.",
        "Hop 2: NGL Price \u2192 NGL Realization: The decline in NGL prices likely affects overall realizations, yet ExxonMobil's combined crude oil and NGL realization stands at $69.85 per barrel in 2023, which suggests a more stable revenue capture despite lower NGL pricing.",
        "Hop 3: NGL Realization \u2190 XOM: ExxonMobil\u2019s NGL realization is embedded within its broader crude oil and NGL realization metric of $69.85 per barrel, which reflects how the company\u2019s upstream and potentially downstream operations interact with the NGL pricing environment."

      "question": "How does the impact of a $80 Brent crude oil price assumption on CVX's 2024 production outlook relate to XOM's crude oil realization of $69.85 per barrel in 2023, considering the relationship between crude oil price and crude oil realization?",
      "answer": "CVX estimates that under a $80 Brent crude oil price assumption, its 2024 net oil-equivalent production will increase by 4-7% over 2023 levels. However, XOM's 2023 crude oil realization was $69.85 per barrel, which is notably lower than the $80 price point assumed by CVX. This suggests that while CVX is planning production growth based on a relatively optimistic price outlook, the actual revenue realized per barrel by companies like XOM fell short of that projection in 2023. This discrepancy highlights the risk CVX may face if realized prices remain below its planning assumption, potentially affecting its production growth targets or investment decisions.",

      "answer": "XOM reported a 2023 crude oil realization of $69.85 per barrel, which is notably lower than the 2022 realization of $87.25 per barrel. This decline in realization relative to prior-year pricing indicates a drop in effective revenue per barrel sold. Crude oil realization typically decreases relative to the broader crude oil price benchmarks, such as Brent or WTI, due to regional and quality adjustments. CVX, in its 2023 10-K filing, highlights that its upstream operations are negatively impacted by crude oil price fluctuations, estimating net oil-equivalent production growth for 2024 under the assumption of an $80 per barrel Brent crude price. Therefore, the $69.85/barrel realization by XOM in 2023 suggests a significant discount to the assumed $80/barrel price point CVX used for planning, potentially affecting upstream profitability and production economics for both firms, albeit with CVX factoring in a higher baseline price for its forecasts.",

      "answer": "Chevron (CVX) reported an amortization of net actuarial loss of $247 million in 2024, while ConocoPhillips (COP) reported $8 million for U.S. pension benefits and $57 million for international pension benefits, totaling $65 million. This significant difference suggests that Chevron is recognizing a larger portion of its accumulated pension liabilities in the income statement compared to ConocoPhillips, which may indicate differing approaches to pension liability management or variations in the size and structure of their respective pension plans.",

      "question": "How does the scale of XOM's total natural gas production compare to the contribution from COP's Alaska segment, and how might this difference in production footprint influence their respective earnings given COP's reported 25% decline in Alaska segment earnings year-over-year?",
      "answer": "XOM reported total natural gas production of 7,734 million cubic feet daily in 2023, while COP's Alaska segment contributed only 2% of its consolidated natural gas production. COP's Alaska segment earnings dropped significantly from $2,352 million in 2022 to $1,778 million in 2023, a 24.4% decline. Given that Alaska accounts for only a small portion of COP\u2019s natural gas production but still shows a notable earnings drop, the much larger exposure of XOM to natural gas production overall could mean that XOM is more systematically impacted by market conditions affecting natural gas prices or production costs, potentially leading to greater earnings volatility compared to COP\u2019s more diversified segment structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Natural Gas Production: XOM disclosed total natural gas production of 7,734 million cubic feet daily in 2023, indicating its large-scale exposure to natural gas markets.",
        "Hop 2: Natural Gas Production \u2192 Alaska Segment: COP's Alaska segment contributed only 2% of its consolidated natural gas production, showing a relatively small footprint in this commodity despite being a major operator in the region.",
        "Hop 3: Alaska Segment \u2190 COP: COP's Alaska segment earnings declined from $2,352 million in 2022 to $1,778 million in 2023, a 24.4% drop, suggesting sensitivity to production costs, oil prices, and operational challenges despite its smaller natural gas contribution."

      "question": "How does the change in COP's total crude oil reserves from 2023 to 2024 compare to CVX's 2024 investment in proved undeveloped reserves, considering the inclusion of proved undeveloped reserves within total crude oil reserves?",
      "answer": "COP's total crude oil reserves increased from 3,121 million barrels in 2023 to 3,514 million barrels in 2024, a growth of 393 million barrels. This increase was driven by purchases (387 million barrels) and extensions/discoveries (43 million barrels), partially offset by production (273 million barrels). Meanwhile, CVX invested approximately $5.5 billion in the United States alone to develop proved undeveloped reserves, which include 624 million BOE of reserves that have remained undeveloped for five or more years. Given that proved undeveloped reserves are a subset of total crude oil reserves (as seen in XOM's disclosure of 633 million barrels of proved undeveloped crude oil within its total reserves), COP's reserve growth and CVX's development investment reflect differing strategic focuses in managing proved undeveloped reserves within their overall crude oil portfolios.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Crude Oil Reserves: COP's total crude oil reserves increased from 3,121 million barrels in 2023 to 3,514 million barrels in 2024, with key contributions from purchases (387 million barrels) and extensions/discoveries (43 million barrels), offset by production (273 million barrels).",
        "Hop 2: Crude Oil Reserves \u2192 Proved Undeveloped Reserves: As per XOM's disclosure, proved undeveloped reserves (633 million barrels of crude oil) are a subset of total crude oil reserves, indicating that both COP and CVX report proved undeveloped reserves as part of their broader crude oil reserve disclosures.",
        "Hop 3: Proved Undeveloped Reserves \u2190 CVX: CVX invested $5.5 billion in the U.S. in 2024 to develop proved undeveloped reserves, with $0.8 billion in Africa and $0.5 billion in Australia, and held 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five or more years, particularly in Australia and Africa."

In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

      "question": "How did the 60 thousand barrel per day decline in ExxonMobil's liquids production in 2021 due to divestments compare to ConocoPhillips' liquids production growth strategy through Permian Basin acquisitions?",
      "answer": "In 2021, ExxonMobil experienced a 60 thousand barrel per day decline in liquids production, partly due to divestments, which offset growth from higher demand. In contrast, ConocoPhillips pursued a growth strategy by acquiring Shell's Delaware Basin position and Concho, significantly expanding its Permian Basin acreage. These acquisitions were aimed at increasing liquids production and positioned COP to capitalize on resource-rich unconventional plays, directly contrasting with XOM's divestment-driven production reduction.",

There was no appraisal activity in 2021. In August 2021, an Alaska federal judge vacated the U.S. government's approval granted to our planned Willow project previously approved by the BLM in October 2020.  The Department of Justice did not appeal the decision and neither did we.  We are actively supporting the BLM and Department of Interior as they conduct the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement process to address issues highlighted by the federal district court.  In the interim, we are continuing with FEED work in service of a final investment decision.\n\nThe Stony Hill 1 well located to the east of the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit within the NPR-A was plugged and abandoned in 2021 and expensed as a dry hole.\n\nA 3D seismic survey covering 234 square miles was completed in 2020 on state and federal lands.  We are currently evaluating this seismic data for future exploration opportunities.\n\nIn late 2021, the Coyote Brookian topset exploration prospect in the Kuparuk River Unit was tested with a near vertical sidetrack from an existing wellbore.  The well was fracture stimulated and will undergo well testing early in 2022 to confirm longer term deliverability.\n\n## Transportation\n\nWe transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of Trans  -Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).  We have a 29.5 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in and operate the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.\n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double -hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels, as necessary.  The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S.\n\n## Lower 48\n\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the Gulf of Mexico.  The segment is organized into the Permian and Gulf Coast and Rockies business units with a portfolio of low cost of supply, short cycle time, resource-rich unconventional plays, and conventional production from legacy assets. Based on 2021 production volumes, the Lower 48 is the company's largest segment and contributed 55 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 64 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\nIn 2021, we completed two acquisitions significantly increasing our Permian position in the Lower 48.  On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho adding complementary acreage across the Delaware and Midland basins.  On December 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Shell's Delaware Basin position adding significant Texas acreage in the Delaware Basin.  The accounting close date used for reporting purposes of the Shell transaction was December 31, 2021.  For additional information related to these acquisitions, see Note 3 .",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

This decline in realization is likely tied to broader market trends, including falling natural gas prices, which also negatively impacted CVX's upstream production outlook for 2024. CVX projected a four to seven percent increase in net oil-equivalent production for 2024, but noted that lower natural gas prices could constrain production growth and economic investment opportunities, highlighting the sensitivity of upstream operations to commodity price fluctuations.",

      "question": "How did Chevron's calculation of ROCE using average capital employed differ in methodology and outcome from ExxonMobil's approach to measuring capital intensity in 2023?",

      "answer": "CVX's interest coverage ratio is calculated by subtracting the $88 million net income attributable to noncontrolling interests from the $27,506 million income before tax expense, along with adding $594 million in interest and debt expense and $214 million in amortization of capitalized interest, resulting in a subtotal of $28,226 million. This is then divided by the $773 million total financing interest and debt costs, yielding a ratio of 36.5. This methodology is disclosed in the 10-K filing, which explains how net income attributable to noncontrolling interests factors into the formula. In comparison, COP's 2024 disclosures mention the interest coverage ratio in the context of financial indicators but do not provide specific figures, making a direct comparison of debt servicing capacity between CVX and COP incomplete without further details from COP's report.",

Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global prices of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.\n\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids can have a material adverse impact on the company's results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company's upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company's credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in our business, including our Chevron New Energies organization. In some cases, transferred liabilities, including for decommissioning of previously divested assets, have returned and may continue to return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently defaults on the assumed transferred liabilities (e.g., bankruptcy). In addition, ex tended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity  of  the  company's  suppliers,  vendors,  partners  and  equity  affiliates  upon  which  the  company's  own  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition depend.\n\nThe scope of Chevron's business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources The company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful  in  replacing  the  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  it  produces  with  good  prospects  for  future  organic  opportunities  or  through  acquisitions,  ex ploration  or technology, the company's business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of economic projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; technology advancements; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; partner alignment, including strategic support; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.\n\nThe company's operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control Chevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company's operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, and other forms of severe weather; wildfires; ambient temperature increases; sea level rise; war or other military conflicts such as the conflict in the Middle East and the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine; accidents; civil unrest; political events; fires; earthquakes; system failures; cyber threats; terrorist acts; and epidemic or pandemic diseases, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\n\nChevron's risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital  investment  reviews  and  decisions  incorporate  potential  ranges  of  physical  risks  such  as  storm  severity  and  frequency,  sea  level  rise,  air  and  water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.\n\nCyberattacks and events affecting Chevron's operational technology networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company's business and results of operations There are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron's cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company's information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. The cyber risk landscape changes over time due to a variety of internal and external factors,",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips experienced a $1,113 million decrease in exploration expenses in 2021, partly due to lower dry hole expenses in Alaska and the absence of prior-year dry hole costs in Malaysia. This reduction in dry hole expenses contributed to the broader decline in ConocoPhillips\u2019 overall exploration spending. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil reported that its capital and exploration expenditures (Capex) included exploration expenses as part of its combined capital spending, though specific dollar figures for exploration alone were not disclosed. The contrast highlights how dry hole expenses directly and negatively impacted ConocoPhillips' exploration cost structure, while ExxonMobil\u2019s Capex strategy encompassed exploration within a larger capital allocation framework.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

          "chunk_text": "Our ability to successfully execute on our plans to reduce operational GHG emissions intensity is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such reductions may be costly and challenging to achieve.\n\nOur framework for managing climate-related business risk is set out in our Climate Risk Strategy, which describes our strategic flexibility, approach to reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity, technology choices and engagement efforts. Among other things, we have set near- and medium-term GHG intensity reduction targets, as well as targets around flaring and methane. Our ability to achieve the stated targets, goals and ambitions within the Climate Risk Strategy's framework is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including government policies and markets, acceptance of carbon capture technologies, development of markets and potential permitting and regulatory changes, all of which may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans. In addition, the pace of development of effective emissions measurement and abatement technologies, and the actual pace of development may be inadequate, or the technologies actually developed may be insufficient to allow us to achieve our stated targets, goals and ambitions.\n\nFurthermore, executing our Climate Risk Strategy could be costly, is likely to encounter unforeseen obstacles, will proceed at varying paces and may be accomplished in a manner that we cannot predict at this time. We expect to be required to purchase emission credits and/or offsets in the future. There may be an insufficient supply of offsets, and we could incur increasingly greater expenses related to our purchase of such offsets. Even if we are able to acquire an adequate amount of such offsets at satisfactory prices, investors, regulators or other third parties may not perceive this practice as an acceptable means of achieving our emission reduction goals. As advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise aspects of our Climate Risk Strategy. We may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end-of-field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets. Even if we meet our goals, our efforts may be characterized as insufficient.\n\nIn early 2021, we established a multidisciplinary Low Carbon Technologies organization with the remit of supporting our emissions reduction objectives, understanding the alternative energy landscape and prioritizing opportunities for future competitive investment. Such potential investments may expose us to numerous financial, legal, operational, reputational and other risks. While we perform a thorough analysis on these investments, the related technologies and markets are at early stages of development and we do not yet know what rate of return we will achieve, if any, and we may suspend our evaluation or investment i f we determine that applicable markets have not developed at the pace required to support further investment. For example, as a result of the hydrogen and ammonia markets not developing at a pace required to support further investment, in 2024 we decided to suspend our evaluation of a low-carbon ammonia production facility on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, we may not be able to scale potential investments. The success of our low-carbon strategy will depend in part upon the cooperation of government agencies, the support of stakeholders, the development of relevant markets for low carbon fuels, our ability to research and forecast potential investments, willingness of industry partners to collaborate and our ability to apply our existing strengths and expertise to new technologies, projects and markets.\n\nEstimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves are imprecise and may be subject to revision, and any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.\n\nOur proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management's best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. Such volumes cannot be directly measured, and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur i mpairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and commodity prices.

      "answer": "COP reported $8 million (U.S. pension) and $57 million (international pension) for amortization of actuarial loss in 2024, while CVX reported $247 million for amortization to net income of net actuarial loss and settlements. COP's 2024 pension benefits disclosure shows a decrease from $18 million (U.S.) and $67 million (international) in 2023, whereas CVX's figure increased from $244 million in 2023. This reveals that CVX maintains significantly higher pension liabilities requiring amortization, while COP has reduced its actuarial loss amortization year-over-year, indicating different pension expense management approaches in the energy sector.",

In comparison, ExxonMobil added 2.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) in proved reserves from the Pioneer acquisition and 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries in 2024, indicating a broader reserve-building strategy through both acquisitions and exploration. Both companies leveraged acquisitions to boost production capacity, though ExxonMobil's additions were measured in reserves rather than daily output volumes.",

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

          "chunk_text": "Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

          "chunk_text": "## Pension Benefits\n\nThe Corporation and its affiliates sponsor about 80 defined benefit (pension) plans in over 40 countries. The Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits footnote (Note 17) provides details on pension obligations, fund assets and pension expense.\n\nSome  of  these  plans  (primarily  non-U.S.)  provide  pension  benefits  that  are  paid  directly  by  their  sponsoring  affiliates  out  of corporate cash flow rather than a separate pension fund because applicable tax rules and regulatory practices do not encourage advance funding. Book reserves are established for these plans. The portion of the pension cost attributable to employee service is expensed as services are rendered. The portion attributable to the increase in pension obligations due to the passage of time is expensed over the term of the obligations, which ends when all benefits are paid. The primary difference in pension expense for unfunded versus funded plans is that pension expense for funded plans also includes a credit for the expected long-term return on fund assets.\n\nFor funded plans, including those in the U.S., pension obligations are financed in advance through segregated assets or insurance arrangements.  These  plans  are  managed  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  governmental  authorities  and  meet  or  exceed required  funding  levels  as  measured  by  relevant  actuarial  and  government  standards  at  the  mandated  measurement  dates.  In determining liabilities and required contributions, these standards often require approaches and assumptions that differ from those used for accounting purposes.\n\nThe Corporation will continue to make contributions to these funded plans as necessary. All defined-benefit pension obligations, regardless  of  the  funding  status  of  the  underlying  plans,  are  fully  supported  by  the  financial  strength  of  the  Corporation  or  the respective sponsoring affiliate.\n\nPension accounting requires explicit assumptions regarding, among others, the long-term expected earnings rate on fund assets, the discount  rate  for  the  benefit  obligations  and  the  long-term  rate  for  future  salary  increases.  Pension  assumptions  are  reviewed annually by outside actuaries and senior management. These assumptions are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in market rates and outlook. The long-term expected earnings rate on U.S. pension plan assets in 2021 was 5.3 percent. The 10-year and 20year actual returns on U.S. pension plan assets were 9 percent and 7 percent, respectively. The Corporation establishes the longterm expected rate of return by developing a forward-looking, long-term return assumption for each pension fund asset class, taking into account factors such as the expected real return for the specific asset class and inflation. A single, long-term rate of return is then calculated as the weighted average of the target asset allocation percentages and the long-term return assumption for each asset class. A worldwide reduction of 0.5 percent in the long-term rate of return on assets would increase annual pension expense by approximately $190 million before tax.\n\nDifferences between actual returns on fund assets and the long-term expected return are not recognized in pension expense in the year that the difference occurs. Such differences are deferred, along with other actuarial gains and losses, and are amortized into pension expense over the expected remaining service life of employees.\n\n## Litigation and Tax Contingencies\n\nA variety of claims have been made against the Corporation and certain of its consolidated subsidiaries in a number of pending lawsuits. The Corporation accrues an undiscounted liability for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For contingencies where an unfavorable outcome is reasonably possible and which are significant,  the  Corporation  discloses  the  nature  of  the  contingency  and  where  feasible,  an  estimate  of  the  possible  loss. Management has regular litigation reviews, including updates from corporate and outside counsel, to assess the need for accounting recognition or disclosure of these contingencies. The status of significant claims is summarized in Note 16.\n\nManagement judgment is required related to contingent liabilities and the outcome of litigation because both are difficult to predict. However, the Corporation has been successful in defending litigation in the past. Payments have not had a material adverse effect on operations or financial condition. In the Corporation's experience, large claims often do not result in large awards. Large awards are often reversed or substantially reduced as a result of appeal or settlement.\n\nThe Corporation is subject to income taxation in many jurisdictions around the world. The benefits of uncertain tax positions that the Corporation has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns are recognized in the financial statements if management concludes that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained with the tax authorities. For a position that is likely to be sustained, the benefit recognized in the financial statements is measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized. Significant management judgment is required in the accounting for income tax contingencies and tax disputes because the outcomes are often difficult to predict. The Corporation's unrecognized tax benefits and a description of open tax years are summarized in Note 19.",

Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

      "answer": "In 2021, ConocoPhillips (COP) experienced a significant decrease in exploration expenses, which dropped by $1,113 million, largely due to lower dry hole expenses and the absence of certain impairments from the prior year, such as the $828 million impairment for the Alaska North Slope Gas asset. This reduction in dry hole expenses directly contributed to the decline in overall exploration costs. Meanwhile, Chevron (CVX) reported exploration expenses of $549 million in 2021, a decrease from $1,537 million in 2020. Thus, both companies saw a decline in exploration expenses in 2021, but the magnitude and specific drivers differed, with COP experiencing a much larger drop due to unique asset impairments and dry hole cost reductions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Dry Hole Expenses: COP's 2021 exploration expenses decreased by $1,113 million, partly due to lower dry hole expenses in Alaska and the absence of dry hole costs from the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia.",
        "Hop 2: Dry Hole Expenses \u2192 Exploration Expenses: Dry hole expenses are a component of exploration costs, and their reduction directly contributed to the overall decline in COP's exploration expenses in 2021.",
        "Hop 3: Exploration Expenses \u2190 CVX: Chevron's 2021 exploration expenses totaled $549 million, down from $1,537 million in 2020, indicating a downward trend similar to COP but with different scale and drivers."

These derivative positions were settled entirely within the first quarter of 2021. See Note 12 .\n\n## Income Statement Analysis\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all results in Income Statement Analysis are before-tax.\n\nSales and other operating revenues increased 144 percent in 2021, mainly due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes.\n\nEquity in earnings of affiliates increased  $400 million in 2021, primarily due to higher earnings driven by higher LNG and crude prices, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate related to equity method investments in our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment .\n\nGain on dispositions decreased $63 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of a $587 million gain related to our 2020 Australia-West divestiture and a $179 million loss associated with the sale of noncore assets in our Other International segment.  The decreases were partially offset by $200 million related to a FID bonus associated with our Australia-West divestiture, gains recognized for contingent payments associated with previous dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments and gains on sales of certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment.\n\nOther income (loss) increased $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to a gain of $1,040 million on our CVE common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million loss on those shares in 2020. See Note 5 .\n\nPurchased commodities increased 125 percent in 2021, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes.\n\nProduction and operating expenses increased $1,350 million in 2021, primarily in line with higher production volumes.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $289 million in 2021, primarily due to transaction and restructuring expenses associated with our Concho acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs.\n\nExploration expenses decreased $1,113 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of 2020 expenses including an $828 million impairment for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset, the early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska, and absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses from 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia.  2021 also saw lower dry hole expenses in Alaska.\n\nImpairments decreased $139 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment in 2021.  For additional information, see Note 7 and Note 13 .\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $880 million in 2021, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher Lower 48 sales volumes.\n\nForeign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased $50 million in 2021 due to the absence of derivative gains and other remeasurements.\n\nSee Note 17-Income Taxes for information regardin g our income tax provision and effective tax rate.",

See Note 3 .\n- A gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020.\n- Lower exploration expenses due to:\n- o Absence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after  -tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset.\n- o Lower dry hole expenses.\n- o Absence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska.\n- o Absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans.\n- Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices.\n- Contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments.\n- An after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a FID bonus associated with our Australia -West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3 .\n- Lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7 .\n\nThese increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:\n\n- Higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes.\n- Higher DD&amp;A expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021.\n- Absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our Australia-West divestiture completed in May 2020.\n- Restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the Concho and Shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips invested $9.4 billion in 2024 toward the development of PUDs, with approximately 75% of transfers to proved developed reserves coming from the Lower 48 unconventional plays. These plays are key to converting PUDs into proved developed reserves, which include both oil and natural gas. ExxonMobil reports that in the Other Americas region, it holds 176 billion cubic feet of proved developed natural gas reserves. Therefore, the development activity by ConocoPhillips in the Lower 48 plays contributes to the broader upstream context in which proved developed reserves, including natural gas, are realized\u2014mirroring the type of reserves ExxonMobil reports in its Other Americas segment.",

The broader market trend, as shown by the decline in the average Natural Gas Realization from $7.48/MCF in 2022 to $4.26/MCF in 2023, supports this regional interpretation and explains the drop in both companies\u2019 metrics year-over-year.",

      "question": "How did XOM's 2023 NGL realization compare to COP's NGL price exposure, and what does this suggest about their relative revenue positioning in the NGL segment given the year-over-year price declines?",
      "answer": "XOM reported a decline in its worldwide average crude oil and NGL realization to $69.85 per barrel in 2023 from $87.25 in 2022, reflecting a significant drop in NGL value realization. This decrease suggests a direct exposure to falling NGL prices, which are influenced by broader market forces. COP, in turn, reported an average NGL price of $26.13 per barrel in 2023, down from $37.70 in 2022, confirming the sector-wide price compression. Given that XOM's realization combines crude oil and NGLs into a single metric while COP isolates NGL pricing, the data indicates that XOM likely experienced a more muted reflection of NGL-specific price declines due to crude oil's stronger pricing, potentially preserving more revenue in mixed production portfolios compared to NGL-focused streams like those of COP.",

        "Hop 2: NGL Realization \u2192 NGL Price: The drop in realization reflects the broader decline in NGL prices, which are influenced by market conditions and directly impact revenue per barrel.",

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' absence of settlement losses in its 2023 pension disclosures compare to Chevron's recognition of $363 million in settlement losses during 2022, and what might this indicate about differences in their workforce restructuring activities?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' 2023 pension disclosures show no settlement losses, indicating stable pension obligations without significant workforce reductions. In contrast, Chevron recognized $363 million in settlement losses in 2022, suggesting substantial workforce restructuring or early retirement programs that year. The absence of such losses at ConocoPhillips implies a different approach to workforce management or pension liability handling in 2023 compared to Chevron\u2019s actions in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 2023: ConocoPhillips' 2023 pension disclosures show no settlement losses, indicating no significant pension-related restructuring occurred that year.",
        "Hop 2: 2023 \u2192 Settlement Losses: The absence of settlement losses in 2023 contrasts with prior years where such losses may have occurred, based on pension cost components.",
        "Hop 3: Settlement Losses \u2190 CVX: Chevron's 2024 filing reveals $363 million in settlement losses recognized in 2022, signaling significant pension-related restructuring activity during that year."

      "answer": "CVX estimated that a 1% increase in the discount rate for its primary U.S. pension plan would have reduced 2021 pension expense by approximately $357 million. This reflects the sensitivity of pension costs to interest rate assumptions. In contrast, COP\u2019s funding policy for U.S. pension plans in 2022 was to contribute at least the minimum required by law, with expected contributions of approximately $115 million to domestic qualified and nonqualified pension and postretirement benefit plans. The data from F_10k_2022 shows that for U.S. plans, a +/-25 basis point change in interest rates would have impacted 2022 pension expense by $45 million or $(50) million, indicating that both companies are exposed to interest rate risk, but COP\u2019s approach reflects a more conservative funding strategy relative to CVX\u2019s sensitivity to discount rate assumptions.",

          "chunk_text": "obligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company's processes to develop these assumptions is included in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company's control.\n\nFor 2021, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.5 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.0 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 1.9 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2021 was 11.2 percent. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2021, actual asset returns averaged 9.8 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception of two years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 6.5 percent during each year.\n\nTotal pension expense for 2021 was $1.2 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company's primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 67  percent  of  companywide  pension  expense,  would  have  reduced  total  pension  plan  expense  for  2021  by  approximately  $81 million.  A  1  percent  increase  in  the  discount  rates  for  this  same  plan  would  have  reduced  pension  expense  for  2021  by approximately $357 million.\n\nThe aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2021, was a net liability of approximately $3.4 billion. An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2021, the company used a discount rate of 2.8 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company's primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 60 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $425 million, and would have decreased the plan's underfunded status from approximately $1.2 billion to $800 million.\n\nFor the company's OPEB plans, expense for 2021 was $85 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2021, was $2.5 billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 2.9 percent and a discount rate for interest  cost  of  1.6  percent  to  measure  expense  in  2021,  and  a  2.8  percent  discount  rate  to  measure  the  benefit  obligations  at December 31, 2021.  Discount  rate  changes,  similar  to  those  used  in  the  pension  sensitivity  analysis,  resulted  in  an  immaterial impact on 2021 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2021.\n\nDifferences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 88 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans for more information on the $5.1 billion of before-tax  actuarial  losses  recorded  by  the  company  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,  information  related  to  company contributions  is  included  on  page  91  in  Note  23  Employee  Benefit  Plans  under  the  heading  'Cash  Contributions  and  Benefit Payments.'\n\nContingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments  on  the  amount  of  damages.  Similarly,  liabilities  for  environmental  remediation  are  subject  to  change  because  of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.\n\nUnder the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be  both  probable  and  estimable.  The  company  generally  reports  these  losses  as  'Operating  expenses'  or  'Selling,  general  and administrative expenses' on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is 'more likely than not' (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading Income Taxes. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2021.\n\nAn estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable  because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range  of  reasonably  possible  outcomes,  both  in  terms  of  the  probability  of  loss  and  the  estimates  of  such  loss.  For  further information, refer to 'Changes in management's estimates and assumptions may have a material",

          "chunk_text": "In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

This difference in methodology means analysts must consider whether COP's ratio includes noncontrolling interest adjustments, potentially affecting comparisons of debt servicing capacity between the two companies.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' Lower 48 segment saw a production increase of 85 MBOED in 2024, attributed to new wells in key basins and the Marathon Oil acquisition, which added approximately 334 MBOED in December. This production growth directly supports COP's upstream cash flow and asset valuation. Similarly, ExxonMobil reported $25.6 billion in cash capital expenditures for 2024 and plans to invest $27\u201329 billion in 2025, which it expects to fund primarily through internally generated cash flows. However, ExxonMobil notes that maintaining or increasing production is essential to support these expenditures, especially given natural field decline rates and the high decline rates typical of tight-oil plays. Therefore, while COP's Lower 48 production growth bolsters its asset base and valuation, XOM's ability to sustain its capital investment program is more directly tied to its success in mitigating production decline and bringing new projects online.",

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

The major sources of funds in 2023 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $37.4 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $20.6 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $4.1 billion, and other investing activities of $1.6 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $21.9 billion; dividends to shareholders of $14.9 billion; the purchase of ExxonMobil stock of $17.7 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.0 billion; and a change in working capital of $4.3 billion.\n\nThe Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On December 31, 2024, the Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term lines of credit of $1.3 billion.\n\nTo support cash flows in future periods, the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields to eventually produce at declining rates for the remainder of their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the Corporation's key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation's net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.\n\nThe Corporation has long been successful at mitigating the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and international trade patterns and relations. The Corporation's cash flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A for a more complete discussion of risks.\n\nThe Corporation's financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures.  Cash  Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion, reflecting the  Corporation's continued active investment program, and includes plans to invest in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion in 2025 (see the Cash Capital Expenditures section for more details).\n\nActual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.  The  Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development  projects  and  exploration  opportunities,  which  helps  mitigate  the  overall  political  and  technical  risks  of  the  Corporation's  Upstream  segment  and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation's liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fix ed commitments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

          "chunk_text": "Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## BUSINESS RESULTS\n\n## Upstream\n\nExxonMobil has a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which allows the Corporation to be selective in our investments, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil's competitive strengths enable the Upstream's business strategy, which is focused on developing  an  industry-leading  portfolio  underpinned  by  advantaged  growth  projects,  applying  ExxonMobil's  technology  to  enhance  value  and  improve development efficiency, and leveraging the unique capabilities of the Company's global projects organization to deliver projects on time and in line with budgets.\n\nThe Upstream capital program is focused on low cost-of-supply opportunities. ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects, including continued growth in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as LNG expansion opportunities in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the United States. As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Based on the current investment plans, the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. Currently about two thirds of the Corporation's global production comes from unconventional, deepwater, and LNG  resources. This proportion is generally expected to grow.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and commercial terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing contracts, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment, international trade patterns and relations, and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nIn 2024, crude and gas prices were within the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010-2019). ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology advances, consumer preference, and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC or OPEC+ and other large government resource owners, alternative energy sources, and other factors.\n\n## Key Recent Events\n\nGuyana: Liza Destiny, Liza Unity and Prosperity floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels continued to produce above investment basis capacity in 2024. The combined gross production from the three operating vessels exceeded 615 thousand barrels of oil per day (kbd) in 2024 and exceeded 650 kbd in the fourth quarter of 2024. Y ellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail, the fourth, fifth and six th developments on the Stabroek Block, respectively, are progressing on schedule and each has an investment basis capacity of approximately 250 kbd. We announced plans for two additional developments and anticipate eight FPSO vessels will be in operation on the Stabroek Block by year-end 2030. We are working with the government of Guyana to secure regulatory approvals for the seventh project.\n\nPermian: ExxonMobil successfully closed the Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) acquisition in May 2024, significantly increasing our Permian footprint. Total production volumes averaged approximately 1,185 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2024, approximately 570 koebd higher than the previous year. ExxonMobil operations continue to deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and cost performance by leveraging scale, integration, and technology. Examples include deploying ExxonMobil cube design and proprietary proppant as well as leading capabilities and technology in drilling and completions. ExxonMobil remains on track to achieve industry-leading plans of Scope 1 and 2 net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the heritage Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. ExxonMobil expects to roughly double production in the Permian Basin to approximately 2.3 Moebd by 2030. (1)\n\nLNG: ExxonMobil continued work on LNG growth projects in 2024. Production commenced from two new gas wells in Papua New G uinea (PNG ), marking completion of the Angore project and additional supply to support LNG  export from the PNG  LNG  joint venture. In Mozambique, the Rovuma LNG  project began the front-end engineering and design stage in 2024, in support of a final investment decision in 2026, to develop the Area 4 offshore gas resources. Construction continues on the Golden Pass LNG project with Train 1 mechanical completion and first LNG production expected at the end of 2025.\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

      "question": "How does CVX's 2023 expected long-term rate of return of 7.0% on U.S. pension plan assets compare with the investment strategy of XOM for its benefit plan assets, given the impact of return assumptions on pension obligations?",
      "answer": "CVX used an expected long-term rate of return of 7.0% for its U.S. pension plan assets in 2023, which accounted for 71% of the company\u2019s total pension plan assets at the beginning of the year. This assumption is based on historical asset-class returns, external actuarial advice, and asset/liability studies. In contrast, XOM employs a diversified investment strategy for its benefit plan assets, primarily investing in passive global equity and local currency fixed income index funds, with equity allocations ranging from 10% to 35% depending on the plan. The long-term rate of return on plan assets significantly influences the calculation of pension obligations and expenses, as noted in the evidence from VZ's disclosures, which states that changes in this assumption can materially affect benefit plan income or expense. Therefore, while CVX sets a specific return target, XOM focuses on risk-adjusted, diversified investments to manage long-term liability exposure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 Long-Term Rate of Return: CVX disclosed a 7.0% expected long-term rate of return for U.S. pension plan assets, which made up 71% of total pension assets in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Long-Term Rate of Return \u2192 Benefit Plan Assets: The expected rate of return on benefit plan assets directly affects the calculation of pension obligations and expenses, as changes in this assumption can significantly alter financial outcomes.",
        "Hop 3: Benefit Plan Assets \u2190 XOM: XOM invests its benefit plan assets primarily in passive global equity and fixed income index funds, with equity allocations ranging from 10% to 35%, aiming for broad diversification and cost efficiency."

However, during the same period, Chevron's proceeds from asset sales declined from $3.913 billion in 2020 to $3.572 billion in 2021, indicating a reduction in asset divestiture activity. In contrast, ExxonMobil saw an increase in its proceeds from asset sales, rising from $999 million in 2020 to $3,176 million in 2021. This divergence suggests that while both companies experienced capital movements, Chevron prioritized asset value growth over divestiture revenue, whereas ExxonMobil leaned more heavily on asset sales as part of its capital strategy in 2021.",

      "answer": "The 85 MBOED production increase in COP's Lower 48 segment, driven by the Marathon Oil acquisition, directly contributed to COP's upstream output growth in 2024, although the company has not yet finalized the fair value allocation for unproved properties from the acquisition. This mirrors ExxonMobil's strategic emphasis on bringing new projects online to counteract natural field decline, which is a key challenge for production sustainability in the upstream sector. XOM acknowledges that while new developments can offset decline rates temporarily, long-term production stability requires continuous investment and successful project execution. COP's acquisition-driven growth exemplifies the kind of strategic move that XOM also relies on to maintain production levels amid high initial decline rates in tight-oil plays.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

The major sources of funds in 2023 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $37.4 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $20.6 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $4.1 billion, and other investing activities of $1.6 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $21.9 billion; dividends to shareholders of $14.9 billion; the purchase of ExxonMobil stock of $17.7 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.0 billion; and a change in working capital of $4.3 billion.\n\nThe Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On December 31, 2024, the Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term lines of credit of $1.3 billion.\n\nTo support cash flows in future periods, the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields to eventually produce at declining rates for the remainder of their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the Corporation's key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation's net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.\n\nThe Corporation has long been successful at mitigating the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and international trade patterns and relations. The Corporation's cash flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A for a more complete discussion of risks.\n\nThe Corporation's financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures.  Cash  Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion, reflecting the  Corporation's continued active investment program, and includes plans to invest in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion in 2025 (see the Cash Capital Expenditures section for more details).\n\nActual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.  The  Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development  projects  and  exploration  opportunities,  which  helps  mitigate  the  overall  political  and  technical  risks  of  the  Corporation's  Upstream  segment  and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation's liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fix ed commitments.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## BUSINESS RESULTS\n\n## Upstream\n\nExxonMobil has a diverse growth portfolio of exploration and development opportunities, which allows the Corporation to be selective in our investments, maximizing shareholder value and mitigating political and technical risks. ExxonMobil's competitive strengths enable the Upstream's business strategy, which is focused on developing  an  industry-leading  portfolio  underpinned  by  advantaged  growth  projects,  applying  ExxonMobil's  technology  to  enhance  value  and  improve development efficiency, and leveraging the unique capabilities of the Company's global projects organization to deliver projects on time and in line with budgets.\n\nThe Upstream capital program is focused on low cost-of-supply opportunities. ExxonMobil has a strong pipeline of development projects, including continued growth in Guyana and the Permian Basin, as well as LNG expansion opportunities in Qatar, Mozambique, Papua New Guinea, and the United States. As future development projects and drilling activities bring new production online, the Corporation expects a shift in the geographic mix and in the type of opportunities from which volumes are produced. Based on the current investment plans, the proportion of oil-equivalent production from the Americas is generally expected to increase over the next several years. Currently about two thirds of the Corporation's global production comes from unconventional, deepwater, and LNG  resources. This proportion is generally expected to grow.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups, operational outages, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, the impact of fiscal and commercial terms, asset sales, weather events, price effects on production sharing contracts, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment, international trade patterns and relations, and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nIn 2024, crude and gas prices were within the pre-COVID 10-year historical range (2010-2019). ExxonMobil believes prices over the long term will continue to be driven by market supply and demand, with the demand side largely being a function of general economic activities, levels of prosperity, technology advances, consumer preference, and government policies. On the supply side, prices may be significantly impacted by political events, the actions of OPEC or OPEC+ and other large government resource owners, alternative energy sources, and other factors.\n\n## Key Recent Events\n\nGuyana: Liza Destiny, Liza Unity and Prosperity floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels continued to produce above investment basis capacity in 2024. The combined gross production from the three operating vessels exceeded 615 thousand barrels of oil per day (kbd) in 2024 and exceeded 650 kbd in the fourth quarter of 2024. Y ellowtail, Uaru and Whiptail, the fourth, fifth and six th developments on the Stabroek Block, respectively, are progressing on schedule and each has an investment basis capacity of approximately 250 kbd. We announced plans for two additional developments and anticipate eight FPSO vessels will be in operation on the Stabroek Block by year-end 2030. We are working with the government of Guyana to secure regulatory approvals for the seventh project.\n\nPermian: ExxonMobil successfully closed the Pioneer Natural Resources Company (Pioneer) acquisition in May 2024, significantly increasing our Permian footprint. Total production volumes averaged approximately 1,185 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day (koebd) in 2024, approximately 570 koebd higher than the previous year. ExxonMobil operations continue to deliver industry-leading capital efficiency and cost performance by leveraging scale, integration, and technology. Examples include deploying ExxonMobil cube design and proprietary proppant as well as leading capabilities and technology in drilling and completions. ExxonMobil remains on track to achieve industry-leading plans of Scope 1 and 2 net zero greenhouse gas emissions in the heritage Permian Basin unconventional operated assets by 2030, and in Pioneer assets by 2035. ExxonMobil expects to roughly double production in the Permian Basin to approximately 2.3 Moebd by 2030. (1)\n\nLNG: ExxonMobil continued work on LNG growth projects in 2024. Production commenced from two new gas wells in Papua New G uinea (PNG ), marking completion of the Angore project and additional supply to support LNG  export from the PNG  LNG  joint venture. In Mozambique, the Rovuma LNG  project began the front-end engineering and design stage in 2024, in support of a final investment decision in 2026, to develop the Area 4 offshore gas resources. Construction continues on the Golden Pass LNG project with Train 1 mechanical completion and first LNG production expected at the end of 2025.\n\nHeritage Permian Basin assets exclude assets acquired as part of the acquisition of Pioneer that closed May 3, 2024.

          "chunk_text": "Proved Reserve Quantities For the three-year period ended December 31, 2024, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables is not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

      "question": "Given that ExxonMobil's Kearl project added 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen to proved reserves in 2021 due to an improved SEC price basis, how does this reserve growth compare to the sensitivity of ConocoPhillips' proved reserves to commodity price fluctuations, particularly in light of ConocoPhillips' $52 billion in productive PP&E subject to unit-of-production DD&A?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's Kearl project added 2.4 billion barrels to proved reserves in 2021 due to a more favorable SEC price environment, which directly increased its upstream asset base. In contrast, ConocoPhillips' proved reserves are highly sensitive to commodity prices, with a 10% decline in estimates potentially increasing DD&A by $774 million on its $52 billion in productive PP&E. This implies that while ExxonMobil benefited from rising prices to boost reserves, ConocoPhillips faces greater financial exposure to reserve estimate volatility, affecting both its balance sheet and income statement through the unit-of-production DD&A mechanism.",

          "chunk_text": "If exploratory wells encounter potentially economic quantities of oil and gas, the well costs remain capitalized on the balance sheet as long as sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made.  The accounting notion of 'sufficient progress' is a judgmental area, but the accounting rules do prohibit continued capitalization of suspended well costs on the expectation future market conditions will improve or new technologies will be found that would make the development economically profitable.  Often, the ability to move into the development phase and record proved reserves is dependent on obtaining permits and government or co-venturer approvals, the timing of which is ultimately beyond our control.  Exploratory well costs remain suspended as long as we are actively pursuing such approvals and permits, and believe they will be obtained.  Once all required approvals and permits have been obtained, the projects are moved into the development phase, and the oil and gas reserves are designated as proved reserves.\n\nAt year-end 2021, total suspended well costs were $660 million, compared with $682 million at year-end 2020. For additional information on suspended wells, including an aging analysis, see Note 6 .\n\n## Proved Reserves\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved in developing such information.  Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.\n\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of 'proved' reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations.  There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as 'proved.' Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines.  We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates.  See Oil and Gas supplemental disclosures for additional information.\n\nProved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur, and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field.  Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of its economic life is based on 12-month average prices and current costs.  This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves.  Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year,  the estimate of proved reserves also changes.  Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.\n\nOur proved reserves include estimat  ed quantities related to PSCs, reported under the 'economic interest' method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices; recoverable operating expenses; and capital costs.  If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices.  We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and increase when prices decline.\n\nThe estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production  calculation of the DD&amp;A of the capitalized costs for that asset.  At year-end 2021, the net book value of productive PP&amp;E subject to a unit-of-production calculation was approximately $52 billion and the DD&amp;A recorded on these assets in 2021 was approximately $7.0 billion.  The estimated proved reserves for our consolidated operations were 2.5 billion BOE at the end of 2020 and 4.0 billion BOE at the end of 2021.  If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&amp;A in 2021 would have increased by an estimated $774 million.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' Lower 48 segment contributed 64% of its consolidated liquids production in 2023, reflecting a significant portion of its upstream activity concentrated in the contiguous U.S. and Gulf of Mexico. Chevron, by contrast, reported total liquids production of 997 thousand barrels per day (MBD) in 2023 across its global upstream operations. While COP's Lower 48 segment drives a majority of its liquids output, Chevron's upstream strategy appears more diversified across regions, including international assets.

This structured approach to reserves reporting influences industry standards and provides a benchmark for other companies like ConocoPhillips.

      "answer": "COP's Lower 48 segment contributed 76% of the company's consolidated natural gas production in 2023, with total production increasing due to new wells in the Delaware Basin, Midland Basin, Eagle Ford, and Bakken. CVX reported total natural gas production of 2,112 MMCFD in 2023. COP's asset valuation in the Lower 48 segment was based on discounted cash flow models that incorporated future production estimates and commodity price outlooks, suggesting that production scale and pricing assumptions play a significant role in asset valuation methodologies for both companies.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips reported an average crude oil sales price of $74.46 per barrel in Alaska in 2023, while ExxonMobil disclosed a lower worldwide crude oil realization of $69.85 per barrel for the same year. This $4.61 per barrel difference suggests either regional pricing advantages in Alaska relative to global crude benchmarks or reflects ConocoPhillips' potentially stronger local market access.

      "answer": "In 2021, approximately 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl were added to proved reserves primarily due to an improved SEC price basis versus 2020, and Exxon holds a majority stake in Kearl through its ownership in Imperial Oil Limited and ExxonMobil Canada Properties, with an average net production of 251 thousand barrels per day. This increase in proved reserves likely enhances Exxon\u2019s long-term production capacity and supports its resource planning under favorable economic conditions.

The company classifies discovered recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting - three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial  classification  are  proved  reserves  and  two  categories  of  unproved  reserves:  probable  and  possible.  The  potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.\n\nProved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to  be  economically  producible  in  the  future  from  known  reservoirs  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.\n\nProved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nDue to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.",

See Note 3 .\n- A gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020.\n- Lower exploration expenses due to:\n- o Absence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after  -tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset.\n- o Lower dry hole expenses.\n- o Absence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska.\n- o Absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans.\n- Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices.\n- Contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments.\n- An after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a FID bonus associated with our Australia -West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3 .\n- Lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7 .\n\nThese increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:\n\n- Higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes.\n- Higher DD&amp;A expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021.\n- Absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our Australia-West divestiture completed in May 2020.\n- Restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the Concho and Shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's production is exposed to natural field decline, particularly in tight-oil plays with high initial decline rates, which the company mitigates through disciplined investments and project execution, including a planned $27\u201329 billion capital expenditure in 2025. Meanwhile, ConocoPhillips' Lower 48 Segment saw an 85 MBOED production increase in 2024, largely driven by new wells and the acquisition of Marathon Oil, which added 334 MBOED in December alone. However, this growth was partially offset by normal field decline and unplanned downtime. Thus, while both companies face production decline pressures, ConocoPhillips leveraged acquisitions and development programs to achieve near-term growth, whereas ExxonMobil relies on sustained capital investment to offset declines and maintain production levels.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Production: ExxonMobil acknowledges that production from oil and gas fields naturally declines over time, especially in tight-oil plays, and that disciplined investments and project execution are necessary to maintain or increase production levels.",

        "Hop 3: Lower 48 Segment \u2190 COP: The acquisition of Marathon Oil contributed significantly to ConocoPhillips\u2019 production growth, but the company also noted that field decline and unplanned downtime partially offset these gains, similar to the production challenges faced by ExxonMobil."

          "chunk_text": "\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $23.2 billion at the end of 2024, down $8.4 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2024 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $35.1 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $23.4 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $5.0 billion, other investing activities of $1.9 billion, and cash acquired from mergers and acquisitions of $0.8 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions  to  property,  plant  and  equipment  of  $24.3  billion;  dividends  to  shareholders  of  $16.7  billion;  the  purchase  of  Ex x onMobil  stock  of  $19.6  billion; debt repayment of $5.9 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.3 billion; and an increase in working capital of $1.8 billion.\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $31.6 billion at the end of 2023, up $1.9 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2023 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $37.4 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $20.6 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $4.1 billion, and other investing activities of $1.6 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $21.9 billion; dividends to shareholders of $14.9 billion; the purchase of ExxonMobil stock of $17.7 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.0 billion; and a change in working capital of $4.3 billion.\n\nThe Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On December 31, 2024, the Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term lines of credit of $1.3 billion.\n\nTo support cash flows in future periods, the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields to eventually produce at declining rates for the remainder of their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the Corporation's key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation's net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.\n\nThe Corporation has long been successful at mitigating the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and international trade patterns and relations. The Corporation's cash flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A for a more complete discussion of risks.\n\nThe Corporation's financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures.  Cash  Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion, reflecting the  Corporation's continued active investment program, and includes plans to invest in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion in 2025 (see the Cash Capital Expenditures section for more details).\n\nActual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.  The  Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development  projects  and  exploration  opportunities,  which  helps  mitigate  the  overall  political  and  technical  risks  of  the  Corporation's  Upstream  segment  and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation's liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fix ed commitments.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "In 2019, Chevron (CVX) reported a net change in the present value of reserves of -$18,780 million, partly due to a $25,056 million decrease from net changes in prices, development, and production costs. This reflects sensitivity to economic life assumptions, as Chevron adjusts depreciation based on expected recoverable reserves. Meanwhile, ExxonMobil (XOM) uses straight-line depreciation for upstream assets when the unit-of-production method does not equitably allocate costs over the asset's economic life\u2014particularly when asset life is shorter than reserve life. The expected life of assets, which averaged between 4.2 and 5.9 years in 2019 across firms, directly influenced Chevron\u2019s valuation changes and ExxonMobil\u2019s choice of depreciation method, highlighting how economic life assumptions shape both companies\u2019 financial reporting.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## Income and Other Taxes\n\nThe  Corporation  excludes  from  the  Consolidated  Statement  of  Income  certain  sales  and  value-added  taxes  imposed  on  and concurrent with revenue-producing transactions with customers and collected on behalf of governmental authorities. Similar taxes, for  which the Corporation is not considered to be an agent for the government, are reported on a gross basis (included in both 'Sales and other operating revenue' and 'Other taxes and duties').\n\nThe Corporation accounts for U.S. tax on global intangible low-taxed income as an income tax expense in the period in which it is incurred.\n\n## Derivative Instruments\n\nThe Corporation may use derivative instruments for trading purposes and to offset exposures associated with commodity prices, foreign  currency  exchange  rates  and  interest  rates  that  arise  from  existing  assets,  liabilities,  firm  commitments  and  forecasted transactions. All derivative instruments, except those designated as normal purchase and normal sale, are recorded at fair value. Derivative assets and liabilities with the same counterparty are netted if the right of offset exists and certain other criteria are met. Collateral payables or receivables are netted against derivative assets and derivative liabilities, respectively.\n\nRecognition and classification of the gain or loss that results from adjusting a derivative to fair value depends on the purpose for the derivative.  All  gains  and  losses  from  derivative  instruments  for  which  the  Corporation  does  not  apply  hedge  accounting  are immediately recognized in earnings. The Corporation may designate derivatives as fair value or cash flow hedges. For fair value hedges, the gain or loss from derivative instruments and the offsetting gain or loss from the hedged item are recognized in earnings. For cash flow hedges, the gain or loss from the derivative instrument is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings in the period that the forecasted transaction affects earnings.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nFair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. Hierarchy levels 1, 2 and 3 are terms for the priority of inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. Hierarchy level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Hierarchy level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Hierarchy level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\n\n## Inventories\n\nCrude oil,  products  and  merchandise  inventories  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  current  market  value  or  cost  (generally  determined under the last-in, first-out method - LIFO). Inventory costs include expenditures and other charges (including depreciation) directly and  indirectly  incurred  in  bringing  the  inventory  to  its  existing  condition  and  location.  Selling  expenses  and  general  and administrative expenses are reported as period costs and excluded from inventory cost. Inventories of materials and supplies are valued at cost or less.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nCost Basis. The Corporation uses the 'successful efforts' method to account for its exploration and production activities. Under this  method,  costs  are  accumulated  on  a  field-by-field  basis.  Costs  incurred  to  purchase,  lease,  or  otherwise  acquire  a  property (whether unproved or proved) are capitalized when incurred. Exploratory well costs are carried as an asset when the well has found a  sufficient  quantity  of  reserves  to  justify  its  completion  as  a  producing  well  and  where  the  Corporation  is  making  sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Exploratory well costs not meeting these criteria are charged to expense. Other exploratory expenditures, including geophysical costs and annual lease rentals, are expensed as incurred. Development costs, including costs of productive wells and development dry holes, are capitalized.\n\nDepreciation, Depletion and Amortization. Depreciation, depletion and amortization are primarily determined under either the unit-of-production  method  or  the  straight-line  method,  which  is  based  on  estimated  asset  service  life  taking  obsolescence  into consideration.\n\nAcquisition costs of proved properties are amortized using a unit-of-production method, computed on the basis of total proved oil and  natural  gas  reserve  volumes.  Capitalized  exploratory  drilling  and  development  costs  associated  with  productive  depletable extractive properties are amortized using the unit-of-production rates based on the amount of proved developed reserves of oil and gas  that  are  estimated  to  be  recoverable  from  existing  facilities  using  current  operating  methods.  Under  the  unit-of-production method, oil and natural gas volumes are considered produced once they have been measured through meters at custody transfer or sales transaction points at the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank.\n\nIn  the  event  that  the  unit-of-production  method  does  not  result  in  an  equitable  allocation  of  cost  over  the  economic  life  of  an upstream asset, an alternative method is used. The straight-line method is used in limited situations where the expected life of the asset does not reasonably correlate with that of the underlying reserves. For example, certain assets used in the production of oil and natural gas have a shorter life than the reserves, and as such, the Corporation uses straight-line depreciation to ensure the asset is fully depreciated by the end of its useful life.",

      "answer": "COP's U.S. Pension Benefits are projected to decline from $369 million in 2022 to $185 million in 2023, a significant drop of $184 million. This reduction may reflect changes in assumptions or funding strategies. CVX, on the other hand, used a 4.5% Rate of Compensation Increase for U.S. Pension Benefits in 2021, which is higher than the industry standard of 4.29% reported for the same year. This suggests CVX may be accounting for more aggressive wage growth in its pension obligations compared to the broader industry, even as COP reduces its pension liability exposure.",

        "Hop 2: U.S. Pension Benefits \u2192 Rate of Compensation Increase: The standard assumption for the Rate of Compensation Increase in 2021 was 4.29%, indicating the industry's expected wage growth used in pension liability calculations.",

      "question": "How did XOM's 2021 proceeds from asset sales compare to CVX's net changes from sales and transfers of oil and gas produced in the same year, and what does this suggest about their respective divestiture strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2021, XOM reported $3,176 million in proceeds from sales of subsidiaries, property, plant, and equipment, indicating a significant year-over-year increase from $999 million in 2020. Meanwhile, CVX reported $34,668 million in sales and transfers of oil and gas produced net of production costs for 2021, which represents a core operational cash flow rather than a divestiture-driven metric. The comparison highlights different strategic focuses: XOM's asset sales reflect a more pronounced emphasis on divesting non-core assets, while CVX's figures align with ongoing production activities rather than strategic divestitures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM \u2192 Proceeds from Sales: XOM disclosed $3,176 million in proceeds from asset sales in 2021, a significant increase from $999 million in 2020, indicating a growing focus on divestitures.",
        "Hop 2: Proceeds from Sales \u2192 2021: The data from CVS_10k_2022 shows a general trend of declining proceeds from sales across 2019\u20132021 for the referenced entity, but this context is not directly tied to the comparison between XOM and CVX in 2021.",
        "Hop 3: 2021 \u2190 CVX: CVX reported $34,668 million in 'Sales and transfers of oil and gas produced net of production costs' in 2021, which is part of its regular upstream operations and not an indicator of strategic divestitures, contrasting with XOM's asset sale figures."

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips spent $9.4 billion in 2024 to develop PUDs, with approximately 75% of transfers to proved developed reserves coming from the Lower 48 unconventional plays. Chevron, in the same basins (Midland and Delaware), added 119 million barrels of crude oil reserves through extensions and discoveries in 2024. This suggests that while COP is heavily investing capital to convert PUDs into developed reserves, CVX is focusing on expanding its reserve base through new discoveries and development projects in similar geographies. The comparison highlights different reserve replacement strategies: COP emphasizing PUD conversion and CVX emphasizing exploration and appraisal-led additions.",

Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's net-to-gross wells ratio at year-end 2021 was 20,528 / 23,645 \u2248 86.8%. This suggests that, on average, ExxonMobil owns approximately 86.8% of the wells it operates, indicating a tendency toward majority-owned assets. In contrast, Chevron defines net wells as the sum of its ownership interest in gross wells, implying Chevron may operate more wells with minority ownership stakes compared to ExxonMobil. While Chevron's exact ratio cannot be calculated from the provided evidence, the difference in disclosure highlights contrasting asset ownership strategies: ExxonMobil appears to operate wells with higher average ownership stakes, whereas Chevron's approach suggests more diversified joint venture participation.",

        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 Net Wells: Chevron defines net wells as the sum of its ownership interest in gross wells, indicating a proportional stake in each well rather than full ownership.",

      "answer": "COP allocated $4,440 million to Development in 2021, with $3,410 million in Total U.S., $175 million in Canada, and $398 million in Europe. This contrasts with XOM, which reports that 17 out of 30 Development Projects have completed exploratory activity and are progressing toward development, indicating a focus on transitioning exploration into production. XOM further emphasizes that its proved reserves and project execution depend on factors like funding commitments, regulatory approvals, and reservoir performance, suggesting a more cautious and conditional approach to development compared to COP's direct spending patterns.",

However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

This reflects a decline from 2023's ROACE of 11.9%, indicating a decrease in the efficiency of capital utilization year-over-year.

      "question": "How do CVX's 4.1% rate of compensation increase for international pension benefits and COP's $893 million projected liability for 2027\u20132031 compare in terms of their actuarial assumptions and long-term pension obligation implications?",
      "answer": "CVX's 2022 disclosures show a 4.1% rate of compensation increase applied to its international pension benefits, which directly influences the growth of future pension liabilities. Hop 2 evidence from another filer shows that the rate of compensation increase for international pension benefits was 3.17% in 2021, suggesting variability in actuarial assumptions across firms. COP's long-term liability projection for international pension benefits is $893 million for 2027\u20132031, significantly higher than CVX's 2022 international pension liability of $152 million in the same time frame. This indicates that COP may be accounting for either a higher base liability, more aggressive growth assumptions, or a longer-duration obligation in its international pension portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 Rate of Compensation Increase: CVX applies a 4.1% rate of compensation increase to its international pension benefits, influencing future liability growth.",

      "answer": "Chevron's significant drop in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\u2014from $143 million in 2022 to $42 million in 2023\u2014positively influenced its interest coverage ratio, which rose from 79.8 to 49.0. This is because the interest coverage ratio subtracts net income attributable to noncontrolling interests from pre-tax income before dividing by interest costs. A lower deduction here means a higher ratio, suggesting improved debt servicing capacity. Given that ConocoPhillips specifically highlights monitoring financial indicators like the interest coverage ratio in its liquidity section, this Chevron trend could be interpreted as a potential benchmark for how changes in minority interest income might influence COP's own interest coverage dynamics and debt management strategy.",

Meanwhile, CVX added 119 million barrels from extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins in 2024, with a particular emphasis on natural gas reserves. While XOM's additions in Guyana reflect a broader oil-equivalent reserve growth targeting undeveloped acreage, CVX's additions in the Midland and Delaware basins were more narrowly focused on natural gas and integrated within active shale plays in the U.S. The scale of XOM's Guyana additions was significantly larger, reflecting different geographic and strategic priorities between the two companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

Apart from acquisitions, the company's ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company's control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, civil unrest, events of war or military conflicts.\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  proved  reserves  for  the  company  were  9.8  billion  BOE.  The  company's  estimated  net  proved  reserves  of  liquids,  including  crude  oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2022, 2023 and 2024, are shown in the table on page 112. The company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids (NGLs) are shown on page 113, and the company's estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 114.\n\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2022 through 2024 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\n\nRevisions In 2022, entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 49 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In TCO, entitlement effects and changes in operating assumptions were primarily responsible for the 35 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan.\n\nIn 2023, the 257 million barrels decrease in United States was primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins and California. Reservoir performance led to the decrease of 101 million barrels, and portfolio optimization led to a decrease of 59 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins. A reduction in planned development activities  led  to  a  decrease  of  58  million  barrels  in  California.  In  Other Americas,  entitlement  effects  primarily  contributed  to  an  increase  of  42  million  barrels  of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In Asia, reservoir performance, mainly in the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait (the Partitioned Zone), was responsible for the 48 million barrels increase. Reservoir performance in Nigeria was mainly responsible for the 37 million barrels increase in Africa.\n\nIn 2024, the 37 million barrels increase in Asia was due to reservoir performance, primarily in the Partitioned Zone.\n\nExtensions and  Discoveries In  2022,  ex tensions  and  discoveries in the  Midland,  Delaware and  DJ basins, and approval of the  Ballymore  Project in the  G ulf of America, were primarily responsible for the 264 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 32 million barrels of extensions and discoveries were from Argentina and Canada.\n\nIn 2023, extensions and discoveries of 124 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 170 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 55 million barrels of ex tensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, ex tensions and discoveries of 119 million barrels in the Midland and Delaware basins, and 45 million barrels in the DJ basin, were primarily responsible for the 185 million barrels increase in the United States. In Other Americas, the 52 million barrels of extensions and discoveries increase was mainly from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nPurchases In 2022, the company exercised its option to acquire additional land acreage in the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada contributing 168 million barrels in synthetic oil. The ex tension of deepwater licenses in Nigeria and the Republic of Congo contributed 36 million barrels in Africa.\n\nIn 2023, the acquisition of PDC in the DJ and Delaware basins was primarily responsible for the 207 million barrels increase in the United States.\n\nIn 2024, the renewal of the Agbami field deepwater license in Nigeria increased reserves by 51 million barrels.\n\nSales In 2024, sales of 593 million barrels in synthetic oil were from the Athabasca oil sand assets in Canada and the 46 million barrels in Other Americas were from the divestment of shale and tight assets in Canada.",

As we had no immediate plans to perform under existing contracts; therefore, in 2020, we recorded a before-tax expense totaling $ 84 million for dry hole costs of a previously suspended well and an impairment of the associated capitalized undeveloped leasehold carrying value.\n\nIn our Asia Pacific segment, we recorded before-tax expense of $ 50 million related to dry hole costs of a previously suspended well and an impairment of the associated capitalized undeveloped leasehold carrying value associated with the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia that is no longer in our development plans.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn our Lower 48 segment, we recorded a before-tax impairment of $ 141 million for the associated carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs and dry hole expenses of $ 111 million before-tax due to our decision to discontinue exploration activities related to our Central Louisiana Austin Chalk acreage.",

      "question": "How does ConocoPhillips' 3.40% rate of compensation increase assumption for international pension benefits compare to Chevron's liability projections, given the relationship between compensation growth assumptions and pension obligations as seen in UPS's disclosures?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips (COP) uses a 3.40% rate of compensation increase assumption for its international pension benefits, which directly influences the projected growth of benefit obligations. According to UPS's disclosures, a similar metric\u20143.17%\u2014is applied to international pension benefits, suggesting that even small differences in compensation growth assumptions can significantly affect liability estimates over time. Chevron (CVX) reports international pension liabilities of $296 million in 2022, with projections showing variability through 2031. The higher compensation increase assumption by COP implies potentially greater future obligations compared to CVX, assuming similar plan demographics and discount rates, and highlights how pension liabilities are sensitive to actuarial assumptions like compensation growth.",

        "Hop 1: COP \u2192 Rate of Compensation Increase: COP discloses a 3.40% rate of compensation increase for international pension benefits, which is a key actuarial assumption affecting liability projections.",

        "Hop 3: International Pension Benefits \u2190 CVX: Chevron reports $296 million in international pension benefits for 2022, with liability projections extending through 2031, allowing for comparative analysis of how different compensation assumptions may impact future obligations."

XOM\u2019s disclosure confirms that proved undeveloped reserves include natural gas components, such as 231 billion cubic feet in Other Americas, reinforcing the material link between undeveloped status and gas price volatility. COP, in turn, explicitly warns that changes in assumptions or factors like commodity prices could materially impact their estimated volumes of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas, and NGLs, indicating a similar exposure to price-driven reserve revisions despite their strategic focus on low-carbon investments.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

          "chunk_text": "Our ability to successfully execute on our plans to reduce operational GHG emissions intensity is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties and such reductions may be costly and challenging to achieve.\n\nOur framework for managing climate-related business risk is set out in our Climate Risk Strategy, which describes our strategic flexibility, approach to reducing Scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity, technology choices and engagement efforts. Among other things, we have set near- and medium-term GHG intensity reduction targets, as well as targets around flaring and methane. Our ability to achieve the stated targets, goals and ambitions within the Climate Risk Strategy's framework is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties beyond our control, including government policies and markets, acceptance of carbon capture technologies, development of markets and potential permitting and regulatory changes, all of which may impair our ability to execute on current or future plans. In addition, the pace of development of effective emissions measurement and abatement technologies, and the actual pace of development may be inadequate, or the technologies actually developed may be insufficient to allow us to achieve our stated targets, goals and ambitions.\n\nFurthermore, executing our Climate Risk Strategy could be costly, is likely to encounter unforeseen obstacles, will proceed at varying paces and may be accomplished in a manner that we cannot predict at this time. We expect to be required to purchase emission credits and/or offsets in the future. There may be an insufficient supply of offsets, and we could incur increasingly greater expenses related to our purchase of such offsets. Even if we are able to acquire an adequate amount of such offsets at satisfactory prices, investors, regulators or other third parties may not perceive this practice as an acceptable means of achieving our emission reduction goals. As advanced technologies are developed to accurately measure emissions, we may be required to revise our emissions estimates and reduction goals or otherwise revise aspects of our Climate Risk Strategy. We may be adversely affected and potentially need to reduce economic end-of-field life of certain assets and impair associated net book value due to the emissions intensity of some of our assets. Even if we meet our goals, our efforts may be characterized as insufficient.\n\nIn early 2021, we established a multidisciplinary Low Carbon Technologies organization with the remit of supporting our emissions reduction objectives, understanding the alternative energy landscape and prioritizing opportunities for future competitive investment. Such potential investments may expose us to numerous financial, legal, operational, reputational and other risks. While we perform a thorough analysis on these investments, the related technologies and markets are at early stages of development and we do not yet know what rate of return we will achieve, if any, and we may suspend our evaluation or investment i f we determine that applicable markets have not developed at the pace required to support further investment. For example, as a result of the hydrogen and ammonia markets not developing at a pace required to support further investment, in 2024 we decided to suspend our evaluation of a low-carbon ammonia production facility on the U.S. Gulf Coast. Furthermore, we may not be able to scale potential investments. The success of our low-carbon strategy will depend in part upon the cooperation of government agencies, the support of stakeholders, the development of relevant markets for low carbon fuels, our ability to research and forecast potential investments, willingness of industry partners to collaborate and our ability to apply our existing strengths and expertise to new technologies, projects and markets.\n\nEstimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves are imprecise and may be subject to revision, and any material change in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGL reserves could impair the quantity and value of those reserves.\n\nOur proved reserve information included in this annual report represents management's best estimates based on assumptions, as of a specified date, of the volumes to be recovered from underground accumulations of crude oil, bitumen, natural gas and NGLs. Such volumes cannot be directly measured, and the estimates and underlying assumptions used by management are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Any material changes in the factors and assumptions underlying our estimates of these items could result in a material negative impact to the volume of reserves reported or could cause us to incur i mpairment expenses on property associated with the production of those reserves. Future reserve revisions could also result from changes in, among other things, governmental regulation and commodity prices.

Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

ExxonMobil reported a ROCE of 10.9% in 2022, calculated using its average capital employed of $222,890 million, which reflects a recovery in oil market conditions. Comparing Chevron's ROCE calculation methodology with ExxonMobil's actual performance indicates how each company's capital structure and investment decisions influenced returns during the year.

      "answer": "XOM\u2019s natural gas realization dropped sharply from $7.48 in 2022 to $4.26 in 2023, indicating a significant decline in realized natural gas prices. This drop suggests a weakening in the natural gas market, which aligns with the broader trend of declining natural gas prices. For CVX, this market trend could negatively impact their 2024 production outlook, especially since their production forecast assumes a stable $80 Brent crude price. A sustained drop in natural gas prices may reduce CVX\u2019s upstream profitability and influence their investment decisions in natural gas assets.",

In contrast, CVX recognized a $1 million settlement gain in its international pension plan during 2024, suggesting selective actions to reduce pension liabilities.

      "answer": "XOM reported 176 billion cubic feet of proved developed natural gas reserves in the Other Americas region in 2024, while CVX recorded 464 million BOE of transfers to proved developed reserves in the United States during the same year. These figures suggest differing reserve development strategies: XOM maintained a relatively modest volume of developed reserves in the Other Americas, which includes both crude oil (375 million barrels) and natural gas, while CVX aggressively converted undeveloped reserves into proved developed status, particularly in key U.S. basins like the Midland, Delaware, and DJ basins. CVX's large transfers indicate active development spending of approximately $5.5 billion in the U.S., focused on completing wells and infrastructure, whereas XOM's disclosures do not reveal comparable development activity levels in Other Americas. This may reflect CVX's more active near-term production focus compared to XOM's potentially longer-term reserve development approach in that region.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

Meanwhile, ExxonMobil reported $2.042 billion in short-term lease costs for 2019, indicating a substantial exposure to immediate lease obligations. Together, these figures suggest that while both companies faced financial pressures in 2019, Chevron's challenges were more tied to asset valuation volatility, whereas ExxonMobil had notable liquidity demands from leasing commitments.",

        "Hop 1: CVX \u2192 2019: Chevron's present value of oil and gas reserves declined by $18.78 billion in 2019 due to price and cost changes.",

      "answer": "The 3.17% rate of compensation increase from the shared industry context influences how CVX and COP value their international pension obligations. CVX reported $296 million in international pension benefits for 2022, while COP assumed a higher 3.40% rate and reported $688 million in international pension benefits for the same year. The higher assumption at COP likely reflects a larger or more rapidly growing international workforce, or more generous benefit structures, which, when compounded by a higher rate of compensation increase, results in significantly larger pension obligations compared to CVX.",

      "answer": "CVX explicitly subtracts net income attributable to noncontrolling interests ($42 million in 2023) when calculating its interest coverage ratio, which results in a ratio of 49.0 for that year. In contrast, XOM's filing does not specify whether it makes a similar adjustment, suggesting it may not exclude noncontrolling interests from its own interest coverage calculation. This difference implies that CVX may be presenting a more conservative view of its debt servicing capacity by removing earnings not directly available to the parent company, whereas XOM\u2019s approach could reflect a broader inclusion of earnings in assessing its ability to cover interest costs.",

In contrast, XOM disclosed 176 billion cubic feet of proved developed natural gas reserves in 'Other Americas' (which includes Argentina and potentially other Latin American countries), suggesting a more geographically diversified approach with a focus on international natural gas assets.

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company's processes to develop these assumptions is included in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans under the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company's control.\n\nFor 2021, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.5 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.0 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 1.9 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2021 was 11.2 percent. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2021, actual asset returns averaged 9.8 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception of two years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 6.5 percent during each year.\n\nTotal pension expense for 2021 was $1.2 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company's primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 67  percent  of  companywide  pension  expense,  would  have  reduced  total  pension  plan  expense  for  2021  by  approximately  $81 million.  A  1  percent  increase  in  the  discount  rates  for  this  same  plan  would  have  reduced  pension  expense  for  2021  by approximately $357 million.\n\nThe aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2021, was a net liability of approximately $3.4 billion. An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2021, the company used a discount rate of 2.8 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company's primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 60 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $425 million, and would have decreased the plan's underfunded status from approximately $1.2 billion to $800 million.\n\nFor the company's OPEB plans, expense for 2021 was $85 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2021, was $2.5 billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 2.9 percent and a discount rate for interest  cost  of  1.6  percent  to  measure  expense  in  2021,  and  a  2.8  percent  discount  rate  to  measure  the  benefit  obligations  at December 31, 2021.  Discount  rate  changes,  similar  to  those  used  in  the  pension  sensitivity  analysis,  resulted  in  an  immaterial impact on 2021 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2021.\n\nDifferences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 88 in Note 23 Employee Benefit Plans for more information on the $5.1 billion of before-tax  actuarial  losses  recorded  by  the  company  as  of  December  31,  2021.  In  addition,  information  related  to  company contributions  is  included  on  page  91  in  Note  23  Employee  Benefit  Plans  under  the  heading  'Cash  Contributions  and  Benefit Payments.'\n\nContingent Losses Management also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments  on  the  amount  of  damages.  Similarly,  liabilities  for  environmental  remediation  are  subject  to  change  because  of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.\n\nUnder the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be  both  probable  and  estimable.  The  company  generally  reports  these  losses  as  'Operating  expenses'  or  'Selling,  general  and administrative expenses' on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is 'more likely than not' (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to Note 24 Other Contingencies and Commitments under the heading Income Taxes. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2021.\n\nAn estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable  because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range  of  reasonably  possible  outcomes,  both  in  terms  of  the  probability  of  loss  and  the  estimates  of  such  loss.
