      "question": "How did the exclusion of integration costs from pro forma results in 2022 compare to the actual integration costs incurred in 2023 following AMT's acquisition strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMT's pro forma consolidated results explicitly excluded any anticipated integration costs or synergies related to acquisitions, noting that these unaudited results were based on historical information and did not reflect the full impact of integration efforts. By 2023, AMT incurred $16.4 million in integration costs, a significant decline from the $45.0 million reported in 2022, indicating that the integration phase had matured. This evolution shows that while integration costs were not reflected in the forward-looking pro forma results in 2022, they were a real and measurable expense in 2023 as the company executed on post-acquisition integration.",

      "question": "How did the change in SPG's exchange rights mechanism from 2023 to 2024 affect the Operating Partnership's partners' equity structure, particularly in terms of the number of shares reserved for issuance upon unit exchange?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SPG had reserved 55,235,238 shares of common stock for possible issuance upon the exchange of units, stock options, and Class B common stock. By 2024, this number increased to 56,002,333 shares. This increase indicates that SPG adjusted its equity structure to accommodate potential exchanges of Operating Partnership units, directly impacting the partners' equity by increasing the pool of shares available for issuance. The Operating Partnership's structure requires SPG to contribute cash to partners' equity if the redemption is to be made in cash, otherwise, the redemption defaults to stock issuance, which aligns with the increased share reserve observed in 2024.",

      "question": "How did the introduction of the Data Centers segment in 2022 contribute to the $27.7 million increase in power revenue in 2023, and what does this indicate about the growth trajectory of AMT's data center leasing strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMT introduced the Data Centers segment as part of its property operations following the acquisition of CoreSite. This expansion laid the foundation for increased leasing activity and infrastructure utilization. By 2023, this segment contributed to a $27.7 million increase in power revenue, driven by new lease commencements, higher power consumption, and pricing increases from existing customers. This indicates that AMT's data center leasing strategy gained momentum in the year following the segment's introduction, with power revenue serving as a key performance indicator of operational scale and pricing power in the data center market.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 1.    BUSINESS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nBusiness -American Tower Corporation (together with its subsidiaries, 'ATC' or the 'Company') is one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. The Company's primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company refers to this business as its property operations. Additionally, the Company offers tower-related services in the United States, which the Company refers to as its services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting ('AZP') and structural analysis, which primarily support the Company's site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its sites. The Company's customers include its tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nThe Company's portfolio primarily consists of towers that it owns and towers that it operates pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in its portfolio, the Company manages rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. The Company also holds other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that it leases primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators and holds a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that the Company leases primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nAmerican Tower Corporation is a holding company that conducts its operations through its directly and indirectly owned subsidiaries and joint ventures. ATC's principal domestic operating subsidiaries are American Towers LLC and SpectraSite Communications, LLC. ATC conducts its international operations primarily through its subsidiary, American Tower International, Inc., which in turn conducts operations through its various international holding and operating subsidiaries and joint ventures.\n\nThe Company operates as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, the Company generally is not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by its REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on its towers and in its data centers, as it receives a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets its REIT income and gains. However, the Company remains obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from its domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, the Company's international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables the Company to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. The Company may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, the Company's REIT-qualified businesses included its U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of its U.S. indoor DAS networks business, its Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of its operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Mexico and Nigeria. In January 2022, a majority of the Company's operations in Ghana, Kenya, South Africa and Uganda became part of the REIT.\n\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation -The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and those entities in which it has a controlling interest. Investments in entities that the Company does not control are accounted for using the equity method or as investments in equity securities, depending upon the Company's ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies. All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. As of December 31, 2021, the Company holds (i) a 52% controlling interest in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of the Company's operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, 'ATC Europe') (Allianz and CDPQ (each as defined in note 16) hold the noncontrolling interests) and (ii) a 51% controlling interest in a joint venture whose holdings consist of the Company's operations in Bangladesh (Confidence Tower Holdings Ltd. ('Confidence Group') holds the noncontrolling interest). As of December 31, 2021, ATC Europe holds an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively (PGGM holds the noncontrolling interests). See note 16 for a discussion of changes to the Company's noncontrolling interests during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nChange in Reportable Segments -During the fourth quarter of 2021, as a result of the Company's acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite,' and the acquisition, the 'CoreSite Acquisition'), the Company updated its reportable segments to add a Data Centers segment. The Data Centers segment is within the Company's property operations. The Company will now report its results in seven segments - U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada,",

By 2024, ATC Europe continued to include Germany, France, and Spain, with AMT maintaining its 52% stake, while CDPQ and Allianz held 30% and 18%, respectively. Additionally, in 2024, AMT restructured its reportable segments, consolidating its Asia-Pacific and Africa segments into a single Africa & APAC property segment, while retaining Germany as part of the Europe property segment. This evolution reflects a strategic refocusing on core European markets, including Germany, while streamlining international reporting.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nSince inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we lease primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nIn 2021, we added approximately 31,000 communications sites to our portfolios in Latin America and Europe and launched operations in Spain as part of our transaction with Telxius Telecom, S.A. ('Telxius,' and the acquisition, the 'Telxius Acquisition,' as further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview'). In addition, we launched operations in the Philippines through the construction of new sites therein and in Bangladesh through the acquisition of a controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited (the 'Bangladesh Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our communications real estate portfolio of 220,131 communications sites included 43,308 communications sites in the U.S. &amp; Canada, 75,725 communications sites in AsiaPacific, 22,165 communications sites in Africa, 30,041 communications sites in Europe and 48,892 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico and South Africa and other property interests in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite'), consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite's existing debt (the 'CoreSite Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as our previously acquired data center facilities.\n\nIn May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of our operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, 'ATC Europe,' and the transactions, the 'ATC Europe Transactions'). We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in\n\n## PART I",

The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $22.5 million and $21.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company paid $12.0 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. To maintain its qualification for tax ation as a REIT, the Company ex pects to continue paying distributions, the amount, timing and frequency of which will be determined, and subject to adjustment, by the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## 15.    NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n\nEuropean InterestsIn 2021, PGGM converted its previously held noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary that primarily consisted of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Poland into noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, consisting of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain. In 2021, Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz') acquired 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing).\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, ATC Europe consists of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Spain. The Company currently holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, with CDPQ and Allianz holding 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively. ATC Europe holds a 100% interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in France and an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively, with PGGM holding a 13% and a 17% noncontrolling interest in each respective subsidiary.\n\nBangladesh Partnership -In August 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited ('KTBL') for 900 million BDT (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing). Confidence Group holds a 49% noncontrolling interest in KTBL.\n\nStonepeak Transaction -In 2022, the Company entered into agreements pursuant to which certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Partners LP (such investment vehicles, collectively, 'Stonepeak') acquired a noncontrolling ownership interest in the Company's U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of $3.1 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity (the 'Stonepeak Transaction').",

Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that offsets our REIT taxable income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2024, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain and Uganda.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments. Our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now have six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. This change aligns with our management structure and better aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on ex isting leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings",

      "answer": "In 2023, SPG disclosed that all of its indebtedness was incurred by the Operating Partnership or its controlled entities, with SPG itself not incurring any debt. The Operating Partnership held substantially all of SPG\u2019s assets and conducted nearly all of its business operations. In 2024, SPG continued to operate primarily through the Operating Partnership, reinforcing the structure where the Operating Partnership directly or indirectly entered into contracts, held assets, and incurred debt. This shows that SPG's reliance on the Operating Partnership to manage its indebtedness remained consistent and structurally unchanged between 2023 and 2024, maintaining a centralized financial and operational model.",

The reduction in gross carrying value, alongside an increase in accumulated amortization from $5,051.5 million in 2022 to $6,823.7 million in 2024, suggests that AMT has been actively amortizing these intangible assets at an increasing rate.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG had a stake in White Oaks Mall, which carried a secured indebtedness of $42,594 (thousands) with a maturity date of June 1, 2024. This property-specific debt contributed to SPG's overall secured indebtedness profile, which in 2023 was governed by a covenant limiting secured debt to 50% of total assets. In 2023, SPG had a $5.0 billion unsecured credit facility and a $3.5 billion supplemental unsecured facility, indicating a strategic emphasis on unsecured borrowing to maintain flexibility within the secured debt constraints. The presence of property-level secured debt like that on White Oaks Mall would have directly impacted SPG\u2019s capacity to take on additional secured debt in 2023, reinforcing a cautious approach to secured financing in order to comply with covenant limits and preserve borrowing capacity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SPG(2022) \u2192 White Oaks Mall: SPG had a stake in White Oaks Mall with $42,594 (thousands) in secured debt maturing in 2024.",
        "Hop 2: White Oaks Mall \u2192 Secured Indebtedness: The mall was encumbered by secured indebtedness, contributing to SPG\u2019s total secured debt position.",
        "Hop 3: Secured Indebtedness \u2190 SPG(2023): SPG was restricted by a covenant limiting secured debt to 50% of total assets, and the company strategically favored unsecured debt to preserve capacity."

      "answer": "In 2022, the redemption price for SPG's 7.50% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units was set at $100.00 per unit plus accrued and unpaid distributions, with the Operating Partnership having the option to pay in cash or shares of common stock. The carrying value of these units was $25.5 million as of December 31, 2022. In 2023, the redemption terms remained unchanged, but the Operating Partnership redeemed 25,000 preferred units for $2.5 million, reducing the carrying value to $23.0 million by year-end. This reduction indicates active redemption activity by the Operating Partnership, which directly influenced the decline in the preferred units' carrying value over the two-year period.",

        "Hop 2: Operating Partnership \u2192 Redemption Price: The Operating Partnership disclosed that the redemption price for the 7.50% preferred units was $100.00 per unit plus accrued and unpaid distributions, with redemption options available to both the Partnership and the holders.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

This series of preferred units accrues cumulative quarterly distributions at a rate of $7.50 annually. The preferred units are redeemable by the Operating Partnership upon the death of the survivor of the original holders, or the transfer of any preferred units to any person or entity other than the persons or entities entitled to the benefits of the original holder. The redemption price is the liquidation value ($100.00 per preferred unit) plus accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or fully registered shares of common stock  at  our  election.  In  the  event  of  the  death  of  a  holder  of  the  preferred  units,  the  occurrence  of  certain  tax triggering events applicable to the holder, or on or after November 10, 2006, the holder may require the Operating Partnership  to  redeem  the  preferred  units  at  the  same  redemption  price  payable  at  the  option  of  the  Operating Partnership in either cash or shares of common stock.  These preferred units have a carrying value of $25.5 million and are included in limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## The Operating Partnership\n\nThe Operating Partnership classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that the Operating Partnership could be required to redeem the security for cash, irrespective of the probability of such a possibility.    As  a  result,  the  Operating  Partnership  classifies  one  series  of  preferred  units  and  noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity.  Each of these securities is discussed further below.\n\nNoncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties Redeemable instruments, which typically represent the remaining noncontrolling interests in a property or portfolio of properties, and which are redeemable at the option of  the  holder  or  in  circumstances  that  may  be  outside  our  control,  are  accounted  for  as  temporary  equity.    The carrying  amount  of  the  noncontrolling  interest  is  adjusted  to  the  redemption  amount  assuming  the  instrument  is redeemable at the balance sheet date.  Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded  within  equity  and  are  presented  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  equity  in  the  line  issuance  of  unit equivalents and other.  There are no noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of December  31,  2021  and  2020.    The  following  table  summarizes  the  preferred  units  and  the  amount  of  the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the structure of SPG's indebtedness evolve between 2022 and 2024, and what role did the Operating Partnership's tax treatment play in shaping this financial strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SPG's Operating Partnership was critical to its financial structure, as all debt was incurred at the Operating Partnership level, not directly by SPG. This structure allowed SPG to maintain control over capital generation and debt management while consolidating the Operating Partnership's assets and liabilities for financial reporting. By 2024, SPG disclosed detailed components of its indebtedness, including mortgages and unsecured debt, indicating a continuation of this debt structure. However, the reliance on the Operating Partnership as the primary vehicle for debt financing in 2022 suggests a strategic financial approach that likely influenced the composition and magnitude of indebtedness disclosed in 2024. The tax treatment of the Operating Partnership as a partnership in 2022, which avoided corporate-level taxation, supported this structure by preserving cash flow for debt service and distributions, which may have enabled SPG to carry higher levels of indebtedness in 2024 while maintaining financial stability.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Simon' mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the 'Operating Partnership' mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to 'we,' 'us' and 'our' mean collectively  Simon,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  those  entities/subsidiaries  owned  or  controlled  by  Simon and/or the Operating Partnership.\n\nSimon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  remaining  12.6%  ownership  interest  owned  by  limited  partners.  As  the  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership,  Simon  consolidates  the  Operating  Partnership  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  and  Simon  has  no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\nWe believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and\n- creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances  by  Simon,  preferred  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership,  or  preferred  units,  the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference  between  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Simon  and  those  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership's financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by  limited  partners  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  Although  classified  differently,  total  equity  of  Simon  and  the Operating Partnership is the same.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Simon  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  this  report provides:\n\n- separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;",

By the end of 2023, this value decreased to $18,894.5 million, indicating a slight reduction of $46.7 million. This small decline suggests that either AMT had minimal new acquisitions in this category during 2023 or the amortization expense outpaced any new additions.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG's Partners' Equity totaled $3,838,744 (thousands), which included $41,763 (thousands) in preferred units and $3,319,689 (thousands) in general partner units. By 2023, Simon's consolidated control over the Operating Partnership remained at 87%, while limited partners held the remaining 13%. Limited partners retained the right to exchange units for Simon common stock or cash, based on stock price, indicating continued alignment between Partners' Equity and Operating Partnership dynamics. Despite a slight decrease in Partners' Equity from 2022 to 2023, Simon maintained its dominant position in the Operating Partnership, with equity structures reflecting consistent governance and exchange mechanisms.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed that the 2021 LTIP program had a Grant Date Target Value of Performance-Based Awards at $12.2 million, with the number of units to be determined in 2024. By 2024, the program had matured, and SPG reported that 209,784 LTIP units were earned under this program, maintaining the $12.2 million grant date fair value. This indicates that the actual award aligned with the initial target value, suggesting a consistent and performance-aligned long-term incentive strategy. The stability in value from $12.2 million in 2022 to $12.2 million in 2024 reflects disciplined execution of SPG\u2019s compensation framework tied to multi-year performance metrics.",

By December 31, 2023, this value had decreased to $1,119.0 million, and further declined to $926.4 million as of December 31, 2024. This represents a drop of over 47% in net book value over the two-year period. The decline is primarily due to increased amortization, which rose from $49.2 million in 2022 to $480.4 million by 2024, suggesting a significant acceleration in the write-down of these intangible assets.",

This growth was driven by $25.8 million from contractual escalations net of churn, $13.6 million from colocations and amendments, and $8.5 million from newly acquired or constructed sites. In 2023, the broader company saw tenant billings growth across other segments, with the U.S. & Canada segment reporting $232.5 million in tenant billings growth and Asia-Pacific reporting $51.4 million.

('Telxius'), a subsidiary of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Telxius' European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing) (the 'Telxius Acquisition'), subject to certain adjustments. In June 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of nearly 20,000 communications sites in Germany and Spain, for total consideration of approximately 6.3 billion EUR (approximately $7.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments and over 7,000 communications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina, for total consideration of approximately 0.9 billion EUR (approximately $1.1 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\n\nOn August 2, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the approximately 4,000 remaining communications sites in Germany pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition for 0.6 billion EUR (approximately $0.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\n\nOf the aggregate purchase price, 233.2 million EUR (approximately $265.2 million), including post-closing adjustments, of deferred payments are due in September 2025 and are reflected in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The acquired operations in Germany and Spain are included in the Europe property segment and the acquired operations in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina are included in the Latin America property segment. The Telxius Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. Subsequent to the acquisition dates, certain adjustments were made to increase assets by $6.0 million and reduce liabilities by $58.7 million, with a corresponding decrease in goodwill of $64.7 million. There were no other material post-closing adjustments. The full reconciliation and finalization of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including those subject to valuation, have not been completed and, as a result, there may be additional post-closing adjustments.\n\nEntel Acquisition -On December 19, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG initiated a $2.0 billion stock repurchase program that indirectly impacted the Operating Partnership by triggering corresponding unit repurchases. By 2024, the Operating Partnership had redeemed 288,350 units from limited partners for $42.3 million, a significant increase from the $13.5 million in redemptions in 2023. This increase in redemption activity reflects a growing liquidity exposure tied to Limited Partners' exchange rights, as SPG's repurchase of shares necessitates parallel redemptions of Operating Partnership units. The structure allows Limited Partners to exchange units for either cash or stock, and the $42.3 million redemption in 2024 indicates a preference for cash settlements during that year, increasing SPG's cash outflow obligations. This trend shows a direct chain from SPG's capital strategy in 2022, through the Operating Partnership's structure, to the liquidity impact on Limited Partners in 2024.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

      "question": "How did SPG's secured indebtedness related to University Park Village evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about their financing strategy and capacity to borrow?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SPG had a secured indebtedness of $53,408 for University Park Village at an interest rate of 3.85%, maturing on May 1, 2028. This debt was part of SPG's broader consolidated secured indebtedness of $5,366,190. In 2023, SPG demonstrated increased borrowing capacity through its $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, expandable to $6.0 billion, and a supplemental facility of $3.5 billion, indicating a shift toward more flexible unsecured financing options. This suggests SPG is diversifying its financing strategy to include more unsecured instruments while maintaining secured debt for specific assets like University Park Village.",

        "Hop 1: SPG(2022) \u2192 University Park Village: SPG had a stake in University Park Village with secured indebtedness of $53,408 at 3.85% interest.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the net book value of AMT's acquired tenant-related intangibles was $14,979.0 million, based on a gross carrying value of $20,030.5 million and accumulated amortization of $5,051.5 million. By 2024, the net book value had decreased to $10,842.3 million, despite an increase in gross carrying value to $17,666.0 million, due to a significant rise in accumulated amortization to $6,823.7 million. This indicates that AMT's amortization expenses grew faster than any new acquisitions or additions to this asset class during the period, contributing to a declining net book value.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the net book value of AMT's acquired tenant-related intangibles was $13,113.5 million, which decreased to $12,195.9 million in 2023. This decline of $917.6 million suggests a reduction in the value of tenant relationships, potentially due to lease expirations or renegotiations. The decrease in net book value occurred despite a slight increase in gross carrying value from $18,941.2 million in 2022 to $18,894.5 million in 2023, indicating that amortization and potential impairments outpaced any new acquisitions or improvements to tenant relationships during this period.",

        "Hop 2: Acquired Tenant-Related Intangibles \u2192 Net Book Value: Net book value is derived from gross carrying value minus accumulated amortization, which reflects the ongoing depreciation of these intangible assets over their estimated useful lives of up to 20 years.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG estimated the useful life of buildings and improvements to be generally between 10 to 35 years, with periodic reviews to adjust for shorter economic lives if necessary (Hop 1). This aligns with the standard practice that buildings and improvements have a useful life that is the shorter of 35 years or their actual economic life (Hop 2). In 2023, SPG provided more granular asset-level depreciation periods, specifying that landscaping and parking lots are depreciated over 15 years and HVAC equipment over 10 years, while the main structure still falls within the 10\u201335-year range (Hop 3). This evolution suggests a more detailed and segmented asset management strategy in 2023, with a focus on aligning depreciation with actual asset utilization and lifecycle expectations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT was actively expanding its U.S. data center footprint through acquisitions, such as the $200.6 million purchase of two U.S. data centers and the $10.4 billion CoreSite acquisition, which significantly bolstered its Data Centers segment. Fast forward to 2024, AMT executed a strategic pivot by divesting its India operations via the ATC TIPL Transaction for total consideration of approximately 210 billion INR (around $2.5 billion), signaling a shift in capital allocation from geographic diversification to a more concentrated focus on core U.S. markets. This evolution reflects a deliberate reallocation of capital from international exposure to strengthening its dominant position in North America, as evidenced by the reinvestment of proceeds into debt repayment under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility. The change underscores a strategic refocusing to optimize shareholder value through asset rationalization and geographic consolidation.",

BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business, inclusive of our data center business discussed below, as our property operations, which accounted for 98% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nSince inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain in-building and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we provide for the leasing of space primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, our communications real estate portfolio of 148,957 communications sites included 42,222 communications sites in the U.S. &amp; Canada, 26,642 communications sites in Africa &amp; APAC (as defined below), 31,786 communications sites in Europe and 48,307 communications sites in Latin America, as well as (i) urban telecommunications assets in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa and Spain, (ii) other property interests in Canada and the United States and (iii) 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States.\n\nIn 2023, we undertook a strategic review of our India operations, where we evaluated the appropriate level of exposure to the India market within our global portfolio of communications assets, and assessed opportunities to repurpose capital to drive long-term shareholder value and sustained growth. The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined below).\n\nOn January 4, 2024, we, through our subsidiaries, ATC Asia Pacific Pte. Ltd. and ATC Telecom Infrastructure Private Limited ('ATC TIPL'), which held our operations in India, entered into an agreement with Data Infrastructure Trust ('DIT'), an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, pursuant to which DIT agreed to acquire a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL (the 'ATC TIPL Transaction'). Per the terms of the agreement, total aggregate consideration represented up to approximately 210 billion Indian Rupees ('INR') (approximately $2.5 billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and the VIL Shares (each as defined and further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Loss from Discontinued Operations, Net of Taxes'), payments on certain existing customer receivables, the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of our existing term loan in India, by DIT.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed approximately 29.6 billion INR (approximately $354.1 million) to us, which included the value of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs and the satisfaction of the economic benefit associated with the rights to payments on certain existing customer receivables. The distributions were deducted from the total aggregate consideration received by us at closing.\n\nThe ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and on September 12, 2024, we completed the sale of ATC TIPL and received total consideration of 182 billion INR (approximately $2.2 billion). We used the proceeds from the ATC TIPL Transaction to repay existing indebtedness under our $6.0 billion senior unsecured multicurrency revolving credit facility, as amended and restated in December 2021, as further amended (the '2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility'). The divestiture qualified for presentation as discontinued operations. We recorded a loss on the sale of ATC TIPL of $1.2 billion, which primarily included the reclassification of our cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of $1.1 billion. The loss on sale of ATC TIPL is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. See note 22 to our consolidated and condensed consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report ('Note 22') for further discussion.\n\n## PART I",

      "question": "How did the change in SPG's ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership from 2022 to 2023 impact the Partners' Equity values across both years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SPG owned approximately 87.4% of the Operating Partnership, with limited partners holding the remaining 12.6%. By 2023, SPG's ownership in the Operating Partnership decreased slightly, as reflected by the General Partner's units increasing from 326,953,791 in 2022 to 325,920,522 in 2023, while Limited Partners' units increased from 47,302,958 to 48,913,717. This shift in ownership led to a corresponding change in Partners' Equity values, where SPG's General Partner equity decreased from $3,097,089 in 2022 to $2,981,728 in 2023, while Limited Partners' equity slightly declined from $448,076 to $447,494. The total Partners' Equity also decreased from $3,586,600 in 2022 to $3,470,328 in 2023, reflecting the broader adjustments in ownership structure.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.  In  general,  prohibited transactions",

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Simon' mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the 'Operating Partnership' mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to 'we,' 'us' and 'our' mean collectively  Simon,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  those  entities/subsidiaries  owned  or  controlled  by  Simon and/or the Operating Partnership.\n\nSimon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  remaining  12.6%  ownership  interest  owned  by  limited  partners.  As  the  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership,  Simon  consolidates  the  Operating  Partnership  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  and  Simon  has  no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\nWe believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and\n- creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances  by  Simon,  preferred  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership,  or  preferred  units,  the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference  between  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Simon  and  those  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership's financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by  limited  partners  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  Although  classified  differently,  total  equity  of  Simon  and  the Operating Partnership is the same.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Simon  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  this  report provides:\n\n- separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG reported a net decrease in Deferred Costs and Other Assets of $77,592 (in thousands) as part of its operating cash flows. By 2024, the company disclosed that $89,871 (in thousands) of Deferred Costs and Other Assets were valued using Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1), with the total Deferred Costs and Other Assets valued at $110,897 (in thousands). This indicates that the company's Deferred Costs and Other Assets became more reliant on Level 1 valuations, which are based on observable market data, suggesting a shift toward more liquid or market-sensitive assets in this category over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG held an 86% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership, while in 2023, this increased slightly to 87%. As the general partner, SPG's increased ownership directly influenced the distribution of Partners' Equity. In 2023, the general partner's equity decreased from $3,097.089 million to $2,981.728 million, while the limited partners' equity also declined from $448.076 million to $447.494 million. Despite SPG's increased ownership percentage, the total Partners' Equity decreased by $115.361 million, from $3,586.6 million in 2022 to $3,470.328 million in 2023. This indicates that the decline in equity was not solely due to ownership structure but likely tied to broader financial performance or strategic decisions affecting the Operating Partnership's value.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.  In  general,  prohibited transactions",

      "answer": "In 2022, the net book value of AMT's acquired network location intangibles was $3,989.5 million as of December 31, 2021, which increased from $3,666.4 million as of December 31, 2020. By 2024, the net book value had decreased to $2,705.6 million as of December 31, 2024, from $2,962.1 million as of December 31, 2023. This indicates a significant decline in the net book value over time, suggesting a more aggressive amortization policy or potential asset write-downs. The change from $3,989.5 million in 2022 to $2,705.6 million in 2024 reflects a 32.2% decrease, highlighting a strategic shift in how AMT is managing its intangible assets.",

        "Hop 2: Acquired Network Location Intangibles \u2192 Net Book Value: The net book value is derived from the gross carrying value minus accumulated amortization for the acquired network location intangibles.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the gross carrying value of AMT's acquired network location intangibles was $6,294.6 million as of December 31, 2021. By 2024, this value had decreased to $5,365.4 million as of December 31, 2023. This represents a decline of $929.2 million over the two-year period. The reduction in gross carrying value, combined with an increase in accumulated amortization from $2,305.1 million in 2021 to $2,659.8 million in 2023, suggests that the company continued to amortize these intangible assets at a steady pace. This trend may indicate a maturing asset base or a strategic shift in focus away from network location intangibles toward other types of investments.",

The 2024 disclosure confirms that this classification framework remains unchanged, revealing that SPG maintains a consistent accounting approach for operating lease costs even as the underlying drivers of Other Expense fluctuate year to year.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nAdvertising and promotion decreased $51.7 million primarily due to the closure of properties as a result of the COVID-19  pandemic  and  governmental  restrictions  intended  to  prevent  its  spread  and  cost  reduction  efforts,  as previously discussed.\n\nGeneral and administrative expense decreased $12.3 million due to lower executive compensation.\n\nOther expense increased $32.7 million primarily related to an increase in legal fees and expenses.\n\nDuring  2019,  we  recorded  a  loss  on  extinguishment  of  debt  of  $116.3  million  as  a  result  of  the  early redemption of senior unsecured notes.\n\nIncome and other tax expense changed by $34.7 million primarily as a result of a higher tax benefit due to larger losses on our share of operating results in the retail operations venture of SPARC Group as compared to 2019, and reduced withholding and income taxes related to certain of our international investments, partially offset by tax expense from a bargain purchase gain recorded as a result of the acquisition of our interest in Forever 21.\n\nIncome  from  unconsolidated  entities  decreased  $224.5  million  primarily  due  to  unfavorable  year-over-year domestic and international property operations, as well as results of operations from our other platform investments, both  of  which  were  impacted  by  COVID-19  disruption,  partially  offset  by  a  $35.0  million  pre-tax  non-cash  bargain purchase gain recorded as a result of the acquisition of our interest in Forever 21 and a gain from the sale of a nonretail asset, of which our share was $17.8 million.\n\nDuring 2020, we recorded $125.6 million of impairment charges related to one consolidated property, an otherthan-temporary  impairment  on  our  equity  investment  in  three  joint  venture  properties,  an  other-than-temporary impairment to reduce an investment to its estimated fair value, and a $4.3 million loss, net, related to the impairment and disposition of certain assets by Kl\u00e9pierre, partially offset by a $12.3 million gain on the disposal of our interest in one consolidated property, a $1.9 million excess gain on insurance proceeds related to our two properties in Puerto Rico and a $1.0 million gain related to the disposition of a shopping center by one of our joint venture investments. During 2019, we recorded net gains of $62.1 million primarily related to Kl\u00e9pierre's disposition of certain shopping centers, offset by a $47.2 million impairment charge related to an unconsolidated investment.\n\nSimon's net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $156.8 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nBecause we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. Floating rate debt comprised only 7.6% of our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2021. We also enter into  interest  rate  protection  agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity  from  positive  net  cash  flow  from  operations  and  distributions  of  capital  from  unconsolidated  entities  that totaled $3.9 billion in the aggregate during 2021. The Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below.\n\nOur  balance  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  decreased  $477.7  million  during  2021  to  $533.9  million  as  of December 31, 2021 as further discussed below.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately $5.8 billion under the  Facilities,  net  of  outstanding  borrowings  of  $1.18  billion,  amounts  outstanding  under  the  Commercial  Paper program of $500.0 million and letters of credit of $11.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the maximum aggregate  outstanding  balance  under  the  Credit  Facilities  was  $2.1  billion  and  the  weighted  average  outstanding balance was $519.9 million. The weighted average interest rate was 0.85% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nSimon has historically had access to public equity markets and the Operating Partnership has historically had access to private and public, short and long-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level.\n\nOur business model and Simon's status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. Simon may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facilities  and  the  Commercial  Paper  program  to  address  our  debt maturities and capital needs through 2022.",

      "question": "How did the acquisition of Spain's fiber business in Q2 2022 influence AMT's Other Tenant Billings Revenue in 2023, particularly in light of the $0.7 million decrease in this revenue category despite overall Europe Property Segment growth?",
      "answer": "The acquisition of Spain's fiber business in Q2 2022 contributed to a $9.9 million increase in 'other revenue' within the Europe Property Segment in 2023. However, this was not enough to offset a $0.7 million decrease in Other Tenant Billings Revenue, which contrasts with the overall tenant billings growth of $47.2 million in the Europe Property Segment. Despite the strategic addition of the Spain fiber business, Other Tenant Billings declined slightly, suggesting that the integration may not have fully translated into immediate gains for this specific revenue category.",

        "Hop 1: AMT(2022) \u2192 Europe Property Segment: The Europe Property Segment included operations from the Spain fiber business acquired in Q2 2022.",

('Telxius'), a subsidiary of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Telxius' European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing) (the 'Telxius Acquisition'), subject to certain adjustments. In June 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of nearly 20,000 communications sites in Germany and Spain, for total consideration of approximately 6.3 billion EUR (approximately $7.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments and over 7,000 communications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina, for total consideration of approximately 0.9 billion EUR (approximately $1.1 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\n\nOn August 2, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the approximately 4,000 remaining communications sites in Germany pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition for 0.6 billion EUR (approximately $0.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\n\nOf the aggregate purchase price, 233.2 million EUR (approximately $265.2 million), including post-closing adjustments, of deferred payments are due in September 2025 and are reflected in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The acquired operations in Germany and Spain are included in the Europe property segment and the acquired operations in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina are included in the Latin America property segment.

Subsequent to the acquisition dates, certain adjustments were made to increase assets by $6.0 million and reduce liabilities by $58.7 million, with a corresponding decrease in goodwill of $64.7 million. There were no other material post-closing adjustments. The full reconciliation and finalization of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including those subject to valuation, have not been completed and, as a result, there may be additional post-closing adjustments.\n\nEntel Acquisition -On December 19, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A. ('Entel') for total consideration of approximately $0.8 billion (as of the date of signing). The Company completed the acquisition of approximately 2,400 communications sites in December 2019 and an additional 530 communications sites pursuant to this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 156 communications sites pursuant to this agreement for an aggregate total purchase price of $44.5 million (as of the dates of acquisition), including value added tax, which have been accounted for as an acquisition of assets and are included in the table below in 'Other.'\n\nBangladesh Acquisition -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited ('KTBL') for 900 million Bangladeshi Taka ('BDT') (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing).

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT's Latin America property segment generated $2.2 million in revenue growth from newly acquired or constructed sites, contributing to a total segment revenue growth of $106.4 million. This growth, despite the sale of a fiber subsidiary in Mexico, demonstrated continued expansion potential in the region. By 2024, despite corporate restructuring that merged the Asia-Pacific and Africa segments into a combined 'Africa & APAC' segment, Latin America remained a standalone reportable segment.

BUSINE SS SE GMENTS\n\n## Property\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company's Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company's data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in seven segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\n\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure -The Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\n\nData Centers - The Company operates 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. The Company's Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the ex isting property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Africa &amp; APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest ex pense, G ain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (ex pense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company's definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') is the Company's chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments' operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management's compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor\n\n## AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)",

      "question": "How did the $80 million loss on sale in 2023 from the divestiture of Mexico Fiber relate to the $1.2 billion loss from discontinued operations in 2024, particularly in terms of AMT's strategic shift in international market exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMT recorded an $80 million loss on the sale of its Mexico Fiber subsidiary, reflecting early-stage divestitures of non-core international assets. By 2024, the company completed a much larger strategic exit from India through the ATC TIPL Transaction, which resulted in a $1.2 billion loss from discontinued operations, primarily due to the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments. The earlier Mexico Fiber divestiture in 2023 was part of a broader multi-year strategy to reduce exposure in emerging markets and reallocate capital, culminating in the full exit from India in 2024. This demonstrates a clear temporal evolution in AMT's international strategy, moving from selective divestitures to full market exits, which significantly impacted its financial statements through the Loss from Discontinued Operations metric.",

        "Hop 1: AMT(2023) \u2192 Loss on Sale: AMT recorded an $80 million loss from the sale of Mexico Fiber, signaling early moves to divest non-core international assets.",
        "Hop 2: Loss on Sale \u2192 Loss from Discontinued Operations: The 2023 divestiture was a precursor to more significant market exits, with the Loss on Sale metric feeding into the broader Loss from Discontinued Operations category in 2024.",
        "Hop 3: Loss from Discontinued Operations \u2190 AMT(2024): In 2024, AMT recorded a $1.2 billion loss from the sale of ATC TIPL in India, a major strategic exit that was included in Loss from Discontinued Operations, showing escalation of the earlier divestiture pattern."

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2023, the Company undertook a strategic review of its India operations, where the Company evaluated the appropriate level of exposure to the India market within its global portfolio of communications assets, and assessed opportunities to repurpose capital to drive long-term shareholder value and sustained growth. The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined below).\n\nOn January 4, 2024, the Company, through ATC TIPL, entered into an agreement with Data Infrastructure Trust ('DIT'), an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, pursuant to which DIT agreed to acquire a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL (the 'ATC TIPL Transaction'). Per the terms of the agreement, total aggregate consideration represented up to approximately 210 billion Indian Rupees ('INR') (approximately $2.5 billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and the VIL Shares (each as defined and further discussed in note 11), payments on certain existing customer receivables, the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of the Company's existing term loan in India, by DIT.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed approximately 29.6 billion INR (approximately $354.1 million) to the Company, which included the value of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs and the satisfaction of the economic benefit associated with the rights to payments on certain existing customer receivables. The distributions were deducted from the total aggregate consideration received by the Company at closing.\n\nThe ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and on September 12, 2024, the Company completed the sale of ATC TIPL and received total consideration of 182 billion INR (approximately $2.2 billion). The Company used the proceeds from the ATC TIPL Transaction to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility.\n\nThe Company recorded a loss on the sale of ATC TIPL of $1.2 billion, which primarily included the reclassification of the Company's cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of $1.1 billion. The loss on sale of ATC TIPL is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n",

By 2024, AMT still held a 52% stake in ATC Europe, but ATC Europe now held a 100% interest in Germany Operations, increasing AMT\u2019s effective ownership to 52%. Additionally, PGGM\u2019s noncontrolling interest in Germany Operations was reduced from 13% in 2023 to 0% by 2024.

In 2021, Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz') acquired 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing).\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, ATC Europe consists of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Spain. The Company currently holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, with CDPQ and Allianz holding 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively. ATC Europe holds a 100% interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in France and an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively, with PGGM holding a 13% and a 17% noncontrolling interest in each respective subsidiary.\n\nBangladesh Partnership -In August 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited ('KTBL') for 900 million BDT (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing).

We recorded a gain on the sales of ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand of $8.5 million, which is included in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The divestitures did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that offsets our REIT taxable income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2024, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain and Uganda.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments. Our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now have six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. This change aligns with our management structure and better aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on ex isting leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings",

      "question": "How did the integration of Telxius-acquired assets in Germany and Spain impact the Europe Property Segment's colocation and amendments revenue growth in 2023, compared to the U.S. & Canada segment's growth from colocations and amendments in 2022?",
      "answer": "The integration of Telxius-acquired assets in Germany and Spain contributed to the Europe Property Segment's $13.6 million in revenue growth from colocations and amendments in 2023. This follows the U.S. & Canada segment's $129.4 million growth from colocations and amendments in 2022, which was largely driven by the InSite acquisition. The Europe growth was more modest and likely reflects early-stage integration of the Telxius assets, as the acquisition was completed in mid-2021 with full integration unfolding over the next two years. This suggests the revenue contribution from colocations in Europe was still ramping up in 2023, compared to the more mature post-acquisition performance in the U.S. & Canada region.",

In 2022, the Grant Date Fair Value of the TSR Award was disclosed as $5.7 million, while the Grant Date Target Value of Performance-Based Awards was $12.2 million. By 2023, this structure remained consistent, with the same determination timeline and valuation figures, suggesting that SPG maintained a stable approach to long-term executive compensation tied to multi-year performance metrics. The lack of change indicates continuity in SPG's compensation philosophy, emphasizing long-term performance alignment despite annual updates to the disclosures.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT placed significant reliance on projected revenue growth rates as part of its goodwill impairment evaluation for the Spain reporting unit, using these assumptions in a discounted cash flow model to estimate fair value. By 2024, the company reported operating revenues of $7.6 billion, reflecting a $504 million (7.1%) increase from the prior year. However, the 2024 filings highlighted new risks, including vulnerabilities related to land rights under data centers, potential lease cost increases, and cybersecurity threats, which could disrupt operations and negatively impact future revenue growth. These risks suggest that while the 2023 projections aligned with the 2024 revenue increase, external and operational challenges may hinder sustained growth unless effectively managed.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## If we are unable to protect our rights to the land under our towers and buildings in which our data centers are located, it could adversely affect our business and operating results.\n\nOur real property interests relating to our towers consist primarily of leasehold and sub-leasehold interests, fee interests, easements, licenses and rights-of-way. A loss of these interests at a particular tower site may interfere with our ability to operate that tower site and generate revenues. For various reasons, we may not always have the ability to access, analyze and verify all information regarding titles and other issues prior to completing an acquisition of communications sites, which can affect our rights to access and operate a site. From time to time, we also ex perience disputes with landowners regarding the terms of easements or ground agreements for land under towers, which can affect our ability to access and operate tower sites. Further, for various reasons, landowners may not want to renew their ground agreements with us, they may lose their rights to the land, or they may transfer their land interests to third parties, including ground lease aggregators, which could affect our ability to renew ground agreements on commercially viable terms. A significant number of the communications sites in our portfolio are located on land we lease pursuant to long-term operating leases. Further, for various reasons, title to property interests in some of the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate may not be as certain as title to our property interests in the United States. Our inability to protect our rights to the land under our towers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\nWe do not own the buildings for all of our data centers and our business could be harmed if we are unable to renew the leases for these data centers at favorable terms or at all, though we generally have the right to ex tend the terms of our leases when the primary terms of the leases ex pire. Failure to increase operating revenues to sufficiently offset any potential increase in lease costs, including as a result of the current inflationary environment, would adversely impact our operating income. We could also lose customers due to the disruptions in their operations caused by our inability to renew our data center leases.\n\nAdditionally, we rely on our landlords for basic maintenance of our leased data centers. If such landlords have not maintained our leased properties sufficiently, we may be forced into an early exit from one or more of these data centers, which could be disruptive to our business or cause us to incur additional costs.\n\nIf we, or third parties on which we rely, experience technology failures, including cybersecurity incidents or the loss of personally identifiable information, we may incur substantial costs and suffer other negative consequences, which may include reputational damage.\n\nAs part of our normal business activities, including in our data centers, we rely on energy systems, cooling systems, communication networks, information technology and other computing resources, and collect, store, manage and otherwise process third-party data, including our customers' data and our own data. We are vulnerable to physical or cybersecurity breaches, attacks, computer viruses, ransomware, malware, fraud, worms, adverse impacts of artificial intelligence, social engineering, denial-of-service attacks, malicious software programs, insider threats, unauthorized access and other cybersecurity incidents that could disrupt our or our vendors' operations, expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. These threats may result from human error, equipment failure, fraud or malice on the part of employees or third parties. A party who is able to compromise the security measures on our or our vendors' networks or the security of our communications infrastructure could misappropriate our proprietary information or the personal information of our customers, our employees or management, or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations or our customers' operations. As we provide assurances to our customers that we provide a high level of security, such a compromise could be particularly harmful to our brand and reputation. We may be required to expend significant capital and resources to address any breaches, protect against such threats or to alleviate problems caused by breaches in security.\n\nGlobally, the frequency, severity and sophistication of cybersecurity incidents have increased, and these trends will likely continue, especially during times of geopolitical tension or instability among countries from which a number of recent cybersecurity events have been alleged to have originated. Such cyber-attacks could be in the form of espionage, phishing campaigns and otherwise. We are continuously evaluating and enhancing our cybersecurity and information security systems and creating new systems and processes. However, there can be no assurance that these measures are or will be effective in preventing or limiting the impact of future cybersecurity incidents. As techniques used to breach security grow in frequency and sophistication, and are generally not recognized until launched against a target, we, or our vendors, may not be able to promptly detect that a cyber breach has occurred or implement security measures in a timely manner. If and when implemented, we, or our vendors, may not be able to determine the extent to which these measures could be circumvented. Any breaches that may occur could expose us to increased risk of lawsuits, regulatory penalties, loss of ex isting or potential customers, damage relating to loss of proprietary information, harm to our reputation and increases in our security costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance and operating results. We offer managed services in certain of our data centers where we provide 'remote hands' services for our customers. The access to our customers' networks and data, which is gained from these services, creates some risk that our customers' networks or data will be improperly accessed. If we were held",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT's Data Centers segment experienced a decrease of $1.1 million in straight-line revenue, indicating early signs of changes in lease renewal patterns or revenue recognition timing. By 2024, this decline had significantly accelerated to a $9.5 million decrease, suggesting a more pronounced shift in lease structures or tenant renegotiations. This evolution implies that the segment may have faced increasing pressure to offer more flexible lease terms or experienced delays in lease commencements, impacting the timing and predictability of revenue recognition.",

      "question": "How did AMT's treatment of deferred financing costs in 2023 relate to the presentation of encumbrances in 2024, particularly in light of their $1,798.1 million in 2023 payments for property and equipment and construction activities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMT reported $144.5 million in deferred financing costs as part of their financing activities, which were explicitly excluded from the face amount of encumbrances, as defined by the accounting policy referencing SPG_10k_2023. This treatment remained consistent in 2024, where encumbrances were disclosed at their face value of $2,325.0 million for 148,097 sites, without inclusion of deferred financing costs. Despite investing $1,798.1 million in property and equipment in 2023, the exclusion of deferred financing costs from encumbrances suggests that AMT maintained a consistent accounting policy for debt presentation across both years, separating upfront financing expenses from the principal debt obligations recorded as encumbrances.",

        "Hop 1: AMT(2023) \u2192 Deferred Financing Costs: AMT reported $144.5 million in deferred financing costs as part of their 2023 financing activities, directly tied to new borrowings and debt issuances.",
        "Hop 2: Deferred Financing Costs \u2192 Encumbrances: SPG_10k_2023 clarifies that encumbrances represent the face amount of mortgage debt and explicitly exclude deferred financing costs, establishing the accounting treatment that separates these two financial elements.",
        "Hop 3: Encumbrances \u2190 AMT(2024): In 2024, AMT disclosed encumbrances of $2,325.0 million for 148,097 sites, maintaining the same policy of excluding deferred financing costs from encumbrance values."

      "answer": "In 2022, the Europe Property Segment reported a $128.9 million increase in pass-through revenue, primarily driven by the Telxius Acquisition. By 2023, this trend reversed with a $36.4 million decrease in pass-through revenue, attributed to lower energy costs. The shift indicates that while the acquisition initially boosted revenue through pass-through mechanisms, the subsequent year saw a reduction in these costs, particularly energy-related expenses, which offset the earlier gains. This evolution reflects both the integration of the acquired assets and changing operational cost dynamics.",

        "Hop 1: AMT(2022) \u2192 Pass-Through Revenue: In 2022, pass-through revenue increased by $128.9 million, largely due to the Telxius Acquisition.",

        "Hop 3: Europe Property Segment \u2190 AMT(2023): In 2023, the segment experienced a $36.4 million decline in pass-through revenue, reflecting a shift in cost structure post-acquisition."

      "answer": "In 2023, the Latin America property segment contributed $58.0 million in tenant billings growth, driven by $35.3 million from colocations and amendments, $20.2 million from contractual escalations, and $2.2 million from newly acquired or constructed sites. By 2024, there was no reported tenant billings growth specifically attributed to Latin America. Instead, growth was reported in other regions: $216.2 million in U.S. & Canada and $154.2 million in Africa & APAC. This geographic shift may indicate a reallocation of investment focus or operational performance toward North America and Africa, while Latin America's contribution either stagnated or declined, suggesting a potential strategic pivot or market-specific challenges.",

By 2023, SPG had introduced newer LTIP awards (2022 and 2023), with Grant Date Target Values of $13.7 million and $23.6 million respectively, showing a significant upward trend in performance-based compensation.

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed its indebtedness structure, which is primarily held by the Operating Partnership, as noted in the 2023 filing. By 2023, SPG maintained an 87.0% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 13.0% held by limited partners.

Additionally, SPG reserved 55,235,238 shares of common stock for potential issuance upon exchange of units held by limited partners. This indicates that the indebtedness disclosed in 2022 is directly tied to the Operating Partnership's structure in 2023, and the exchange rights reserved by SPG reflect its ongoing control and consolidation of the Operating Partnership, while also highlighting the financial implications of potential unit conversions on SPG\u2019s equity structure.",

      "question": "How did the change in SPG's Partners' Equity from 2022 ($3,838,744M) to 2023 relate to Simon's ability to fund unit redemptions in the Operating Partnership, given the exchange rights tied to the Operating Partnership's structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Simon Property Group's (SPG) Partners' Equity stood at $3,838,744M, reflecting the capital invested in the Operating Partnership through common and preferred units. This equity base, combined with Simon's 87.4% controlling stake in the Operating Partnership, provided a strong foundation to support redemption requests from limited partners. By 2023, the Operating Partnership granted limited partners the right to exchange units for either Simon common stock or cash, at Simon's discretion. However, if Simon elected to redeem units for cash, it was required to contribute sufficient cash to the Operating Partnership as partners' equity to fund the redemption. This interplay shows a 3-hop temporal evolution: (1) SPG's 2022 Partners' Equity reflects the capital structure supporting the Operating Partnership, (2) the Operating Partnership's structure accounts for equity stakes and redemption mechanics, and (3) SPG's 2023 position reveals how the firm's capital flexibility evolved, directly influenced by the equity base and partnership dynamics. The system ensures that Simon maintains control while honoring redemption rights, either through stock issuance or direct equity contributions for cash redemptions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SPG(2022) \u2192 Partners' Equity: SPG reported $3,838,744M in Partners' Equity, reflecting capital invested in the Operating Partnership through units held by limited partners and preferred units.",
        "Hop 2: Partners' Equity \u2192 Operating Partnership: Simon held an 87.4% stake in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 12.6% owned by limited partners, whose units are accounted for as Partners' Equity in the Operating Partnership's financials.",
        "Hop 3: Operating Partnership \u2190 SPG(2023): In 2023, SPG maintained the ability to redeem limited partner units for cash only if it contributed sufficient capital to the Operating Partnership, showing how the equity structure evolved to support redemption flexibility."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## EXPLANATORY NOTE\n\nThis report combines the annual reports on Form 10-K for the annual period ended December 31, 2021 of Simon Property Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation, and Simon Property Group, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership. Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Simon' mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the 'Operating Partnership' mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to 'we,' 'us' and 'our' mean collectively  Simon,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  those  entities/subsidiaries  owned  or  controlled  by  Simon and/or the Operating Partnership.\n\nSimon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  remaining  12.6%  ownership  interest  owned  by  limited  partners.  As  the  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership,  Simon  consolidates  the  Operating  Partnership  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  and  Simon  has  no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\nWe believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and\n- creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances  by  Simon,  preferred  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership,  or  preferred  units,  the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference  between  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Simon  and  those  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership's financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by  limited  partners  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  Although  classified  differently,  total  equity  of  Simon  and  the Operating Partnership is the same.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Simon  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  this  report provides:\n\n- separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;",

      "answer": "The net book value of AMT's acquired network location intangibles increased from $3,666.4 million as of December 31, 2020 (reported in the 2022 filing), to $3,989.5 million as of December 31, 2021, indicating new acquisitions or revaluations during 2021. However, by December 31, 2023, the net book value had declined to $3,205.7 million, despite a slight increase in gross carrying value from $6,294.6 million (2021) to $5,981.5 million (2023). This decline in net book value suggests that the amortization expense accelerated (from $2,305.1 million in 2021 to $2,775.8 million in 2023), and there were likely no significant new acquisitions to offset the amortization. This indicates a relatively stable or slightly declining asset base with consistent amortization practices.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 6.    ACQUISITIONS\n\nThe Company evaluates each of its acquisitions under the accounting guidance framework to determine whether to treat an acquisition as an asset acquisition or a business combination. For those transactions treated as asset acquisitions, the purchase price is allocated to the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed, with no recognition of goodwill. For those transactions treated as business combinations, the estimates of the fair value of the assets or rights acquired and liabilities assumed at the date of the applicable acquisition are subject to adjustment during the measurement period (up to one year from the particular acquisition date).\n\nThe fair value of these net assets acquired are based on management's estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. While the Company believes that such preliminary estimates provide a reasonable basis for estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, it evaluates any necessary information prior to finalization of the fair value. During the measurement period for those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have resulted in the revised estimated values of those assets or liabilities as of that date.\n\nImpact of current year acquisitions -The Company typically acquires communications sites and other communications infrastructure assets from wireless carriers or other tower operators and subsequently integrates those sites and related assets into its existing portfolio of communications sites and related assets. In the United States, acquisitions may also include data center facilities and related assets. The financial results of the Company's acquisitions have been included in the Company's consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024 from the date of the respective acquisition. The date of acquisition, and by extension the point at which the Company begins to recognize the results of an acquisition, may depend on, among other things, the receipt of contractual consents, the commencement and extent of leasing arrangements and the timing of the transfer of title or rights to the assets, which may be accomplished in phases. Communications sites acquired from communications service providers may never have been operated as a business and may instead have been utilized solely by the seller as a component of its network infrastructure. An acquisition may or may not involve the transfer of business operations or employees.\n\nFor those acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, the Company recognizes acquisition and merger related expenses in the period in which they are incurred and services are received; for transactions accounted for as asset acquisitions, these costs are capitalized as part of the purchase price. Acquisition, disposition and merger related costs may include finder's fees, advisory, legal, accounting, valuation and other professional or consulting fees and general administrative costs directly related to completing the transaction. Integration costs include incremental and non-recurring costs necessary to convert data and systems, retain employees and otherwise enable the Company to operate acquired businesses or assets efficiently. The Company records acquisition, disposition and merger related expenses not subject to capitalization, as well as integration costs for all transactions, in Other operating ex penses in the consolidated statements of operations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed that the Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Award for the 2021 LTIP program was $5.7 million, with a Grant Date Target Value of $12.2 million. This same award was still referenced in 2023 as part of the ongoing 2021 LTIP Awards, maintaining the same $5.7 million fair value and $12.2 million target. The consistency in these figures across reporting years indicates that SPG's long-term incentive compensation strategy for this particular LTIP remained stable year-over-year, with no mid-program adjustments to the TSR award values.",

By 2023, Simon had reserved 55,235,238 shares of common stock for potential issuance upon exchange of Operating Partnership units, indicating a growing alignment between the two entities.

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Simon' mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the 'Operating Partnership' mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to 'we,' 'us' and 'our' mean collectively  Simon,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  those  entities/subsidiaries  owned  or  controlled  by  Simon and/or the Operating Partnership.\n\nSimon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  remaining  12.6%  ownership  interest  owned  by  limited  partners.  As  the  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership,  Simon  consolidates  the  Operating  Partnership  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  and  Simon  has  no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\nWe believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and\n- creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances  by  Simon,  preferred  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership,  or  preferred  units,  the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference  between  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Simon  and  those  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership's financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by  limited  partners  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  Although  classified  differently,  total  equity  of  Simon  and  the Operating Partnership is the same.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Simon  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  this  report provides:\n\n- separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;",

      "answer": "In 2023, SPG disclosed Limited Partners' interests in the Operating Partnership at $447,494 million, showing a slight decrease from 2022. By 2024, the partnership agreement continued to allow Limited Partners the right to exchange units for SPG common stock or cash, with SPG reserving 56,002,333 shares for such exchanges. In its 2024 filing, SPG emphasized a more structured presentation of financial statements and operational discussions distinguishing SPG from the Operating Partnership, indicating increased transparency in how the company manages and reports its relationship with the Operating Partnership compared to prior years. This suggests that despite a relatively stable interest level from Limited Partners, SPG evolved its disclosure strategy to clarify the interplay between the two entities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we also completed the sales of our subsidiaries in Australia ('ATC Australia') and New Zealand ('ATC New Zealand') for total aggregate consideration of approximately $77.6 million. We recorded a gain on the sales of ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand of $8.5 million, which is included in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The divestitures did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that offsets our REIT taxable income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2024, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain and Uganda.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments. Our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now have six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. This change aligns with our management structure and better aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on ex isting leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings",

      "question": "How did SPG's approach to estimating the useful life of buildings and improvements in 2022 compare to the disclosed depreciation periods in 2023, and what does this suggest about their asset life assumptions over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SPG stated that buildings and improvements were depreciated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives generally ranging from 10 to 35 years, with periodic reviews to adjust for shorter economic lives if necessary. This implies a flexible approach to useful life estimation based on property-specific conditions. In 2023, SPG disclosed more specific depreciation periods: 10\u201335 years for building structures, 15 years for landscaping and parking lots, and 10 years for HVAC equipment. While the 10\u201335 year range for structures remained consistent, the 2023 disclosures added granularity and potentially signaled more standardized assumptions for components like landscaping and HVAC. This evolution suggests SPG may have refined its depreciation policy over time, moving toward more defined asset-level useful life categories while maintaining alignment with earlier estimation ranges for major components like building structures.",

By 2024, SPG maintained a consolidated structure where it owned approximately 86.5% of the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 13.5% held by limited partners, whose units were classified as Partners' Equity in the Operating Partnership's financials. Limited partners retained the right to exchange their units for either Simon common stock on a one-for-one basis or cash, contingent on Simon\u2019s Board decision.

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT generated $20.2 million in contractual escalations revenue from its Latin America Property Segment, reflecting strong tenant retention and pricing power in the region. This revenue stream contributed to the overall $106.4 million growth in the Latin America segment, driven by tenant billings and pass-through revenue increases. By 2024, despite a broader segment restructuring that combined Asia-Pacific and Africa into a single segment, the Latin America Property Segment remained intact and operationally significant, with AMT maintaining property operations across eight countries in the region. This continuity suggests that the contractual revenue growth observed in 2023 played a role in reinforcing AMT's strategic commitment to Latin America, even as it consolidated other regional segments.",

BUSINE SS SE GMENTS\n\n## Property\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company's Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company's data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in seven segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\n\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure -The Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\n\nData Centers - The Company operates 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. The Company's Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the ex isting property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Africa &amp; APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest ex pense, G ain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (ex pense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company's definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') is the Company's chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments' operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management's compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor\n\n## AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)",

      "answer": "The net book value of AMT's acquired network location intangibles decreased from $3,520.3 million in 2022 to $3,205.7 million in 2023, a decline of $314.6 million. This change reflects the ongoing depreciation of these assets over their estimated useful lives (up to 20 years), which is directly tied to the initial cost basis established at the time of acquisition or development. According to the SPG 2023 disclosure, initial cost generally represents the net book value at the time of acquisition or development, and depreciation is calculated over the estimated original lives of the assets.

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nSince inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we lease primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nIn 2021, we added approximately 31,000 communications sites to our portfolios in Latin America and Europe and launched operations in Spain as part of our transaction with Telxius Telecom, S.A. ('Telxius,' and the acquisition, the 'Telxius Acquisition,' as further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview'). In addition, we launched operations in the Philippines through the construction of new sites therein and in Bangladesh through the acquisition of a controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited (the 'Bangladesh Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our communications real estate portfolio of 220,131 communications sites included 43,308 communications sites in the U.S. &amp; Canada, 75,725 communications sites in AsiaPacific, 22,165 communications sites in Africa, 30,041 communications sites in Europe and 48,892 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico and South Africa and other property interests in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite'), consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite's existing debt (the 'CoreSite Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as our previously acquired data center facilities.\n\nIn May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of our operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, 'ATC Europe,' and the transactions, the 'ATC Europe Transactions'). We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in\n\n## PART I",

The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $22.5 million and $21.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company paid $12.0 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. To maintain its qualification for tax ation as a REIT, the Company ex pects to continue paying distributions, the amount, timing and frequency of which will be determined, and subject to adjustment, by the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## 15.    NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n\nEuropean InterestsIn 2021, PGGM converted its previously held noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary that primarily consisted of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Poland into noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, consisting of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain. In 2021, Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz') acquired 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing).\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, ATC Europe consists of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Spain. The Company currently holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, with CDPQ and Allianz holding 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively. ATC Europe holds a 100% interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in France and an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively, with PGGM holding a 13% and a 17% noncontrolling interest in each respective subsidiary.\n\nBangladesh Partnership -In August 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited ('KTBL') for 900 million BDT (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing). Confidence Group holds a 49% noncontrolling interest in KTBL.\n\nStonepeak Transaction -In 2022, the Company entered into agreements pursuant to which certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Partners LP (such investment vehicles, collectively, 'Stonepeak') acquired a noncontrolling ownership interest in the Company's U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of $3.1 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity (the 'Stonepeak Transaction').",

Our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now have six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. This change aligns with our management structure and better aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on ex isting leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT's Data Centers segment revenue grew by $68.1 million, with $27.7 million attributed to power revenue driven by new lease commencements, increased power consumption, and pricing increases from existing customers. In 2024, the Data Centers segment revenue growth increased to $90.1 million, with $30.8 million coming from power revenue, also driven by new lease commencements and pricing increases. This indicates a $3.1 million increase in power revenue contribution year-over-year, reflecting both continued demand for data center services and successful pricing strategies.",

By 2024, the face amount of the secured indebtedness for the same property remained at $185 million, but the annual debt service increased slightly to $7,824,000 from $7,932,000.

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT expanded its Latin America property segment through the Telxius and Entel acquisitions, adding over 7,000 communications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina for approximately $1.1 billion. This expansion contributed to a tenant billings growth of $58.0 million in 2023, driven by $35.3 million from colocations and amendments and $20.2 million from contractual escalations, net of churn. While foreign currency translation added $98.6 million to segment revenue growth, the core tenant billings growth reflects the increased scale and operational integration of the acquired sites.",

      "answer": "SPG's 2022 depreciation policy stated that buildings and improvements are depreciated over 10 to 35 years, with periodic reviews to adjust for shorter economic lives if necessary. By 2024, the value of buildings and improvements had increased from $35.14B in 2023 to $36.08B, indicating continued investment and capitalization of improvements rather than immediate expensing. This growth aligns with a strategy of long-term asset retention and reinvestment, assuming that useful lives remain in the higher end of the 10-35 year range, as no significant reduction in asset value was observed. The consistency in depreciation methodology\u2014linked to useful life estimates\u2014suggests SPG maintained confidence in the long-term economic utility of its properties despite market fluctuations.",

      "question": "How did the change in SPG's Partners' Equity from 2023 to 2024 reflect the evolving structure and financial role of the Operating Partnership, particularly in terms of Simon Property Group, Inc.'s consolidated control and capital contributions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SPG's Partners' Equity totaled $3,470,328, reflecting its ownership structure and capital contributions through the Operating Partnership. By 2024, Simon Property Group, Inc. held an approximate 86.5% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 13.5% owned by limited partners. This shift indicates a consolidation of control by Simon, as it contributed proceeds from equity issuances\u2014such as common or preferred stock\u2014to the Operating Partnership in exchange for partnership units. The Operating Partnership, in turn, held substantially all of SPG\u2019s assets and conducted most of its business, directly or indirectly. This structure allowed Simon to consolidate the Operating Partnership\u2019s financials, aligning with the trend of centralized control and capital flow between the parent company and its key operating entity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SPG(2023) \u2192 Partners' Equity: Partners' Equity was $3,470,328 as of December 31, 2023, reflecting the capital structure and stakeholder contributions.",
        "Hop 2: Partners' Equity \u2192 Operating Partnership: The Operating Partnership was the primary vehicle for capital contributions, with equity issuances by Simon directly funding partnership units.",
        "Hop 3: Operating Partnership \u2190 SPG(2024): By 2024, Simon held 86.5% of the Operating Partnership, consolidating its operations and assets, while the remaining 13.5% was held by limited partners, showing increased centralization of control."

W e  are  structured  as  an  um brella  partnership  R E I T   under  which  substantially  all  of  our  business  is  conducted  through  the Operating P artnership, Sim on's m ajority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Sim on is the general partner. As of D ecem ber 31, 2024,  Sim on  owned  an  approxim ate  86.5%  ownership  interest  in  the  O perating  P artnership,  with  the  rem aining  13.5%  ownership interest  owned  by  lim ited  partners. As  the  sole  general  partner  of  the  O perating  P artnership,  S im on  has  exclusive  control  of  the Operating P artnership's day-to-day m anagem ent.\n\nWe operate Sim on and the O perating P artnership as one business. T he m anagem ent of Sim on consists of the sam e m em bers as the m anagem ent of the O perating P artnership. As general partner with control of the O perating P artnership, Sim on consolidates the Operating P artnership for financial reporting purposes, and Sim on has no m aterial assets or liabilities other than its investm ent in the Operating P artnership. T herefore, the assets and liabilities of Sim on and the O perating P artnership are the sam e on their respective financial statem ents.\n\nWe believe  that  com bining  the  annual  reports  on  F orm   10-K  of  S im on  and  the  O perating  P artnership  into  this  single  report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Sim on and the O perating P artnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the sam e m anner as m anagem ent views and operates the business;\n- elim inates duplicative disclosure and provides a m ore stream lined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Sim on and the O perating P artnership; and\n- creates tim e and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one com bined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is im portant for investors to understand the few differences between Sim on and the O perating P artnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated com pany. T he prim ary difference is that Sim on itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the O perating P artnership and issuing equity or equity-related instrum ents from  tim e to tim e. I n addition, Sim on itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the O perating P artnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the O perating P artnership.\n\nThe Operating P artnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. T he O perating P artnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. E xcept for the net proceeds from  equity issuances by Sim on, which are contributed to the capital of the O perating P artnership in exchange for, in the case of com m on stock issuances by Sim on, com m on units of partnership interest in the O perating P artnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances by Sim on, preferred units of partnership interest in the O perating P artnership, or preferred units, the O perating P artnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from  the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the m ain areas of difference between the consolidated financial statem ents of Sim on and those of the O perating P artnership. T he differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from  differences in the equity issued at the Sim on and O perating P artnership levels. T he units held by lim ited partners in the O perating P artnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the O perating P artnership's financial statem ents and as noncontrolling interests in Sim on's financial statem ents. T he noncontrolling interests in the O perating P artnership's financial statem ents include  the  interests  of  unaffiliated  partners  in  various  consolidated  partnerships.  T he  noncontrolling  interests  in  S im on's  financial statem ents include the sam e noncontrolling interests at the O perating P artnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by lim ited partners of the O perating P artnership. Although classified differently, total equity of Sim on and the O perating P artnership is the sam e.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nSince inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we lease primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nIn 2021, we added approximately 31,000 communications sites to our portfolios in Latin America and Europe and launched operations in Spain as part of our transaction with Telxius Telecom, S.A. ('Telxius,' and the acquisition, the 'Telxius Acquisition,' as further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview'). In addition, we launched operations in the Philippines through the construction of new sites therein and in Bangladesh through the acquisition of a controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited (the 'Bangladesh Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our communications real estate portfolio of 220,131 communications sites included 43,308 communications sites in the U.S. &amp; Canada, 75,725 communications sites in AsiaPacific, 22,165 communications sites in Africa, 30,041 communications sites in Europe and 48,892 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico and South Africa and other property interests in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite'), consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite's existing debt (the 'CoreSite Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as our previously acquired data center facilities.\n\nIn May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of our operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, 'ATC Europe,' and the transactions, the 'ATC Europe Transactions'). We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in\n\n## PART I",

The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $22.5 million and $21.5 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company paid $12.0 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. To maintain its qualification for tax ation as a REIT, the Company ex pects to continue paying distributions, the amount, timing and frequency of which will be determined, and subject to adjustment, by the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## 15.    NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n\nEuropean InterestsIn 2021, PGGM converted its previously held noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary that primarily consisted of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Poland into noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, consisting of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain. In 2021, Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz') acquired 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing).\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, ATC Europe consists of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Spain. The Company currently holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, with CDPQ and Allianz holding 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively. ATC Europe holds a 100% interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in France and an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively, with PGGM holding a 13% and a 17% noncontrolling interest in each respective subsidiary.\n\nBangladesh Partnership -In August 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited ('KTBL') for 900 million BDT (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing). Confidence Group holds a 49% noncontrolling interest in KTBL.\n\nStonepeak Transaction -In 2022, the Company entered into agreements pursuant to which certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Partners LP (such investment vehicles, collectively, 'Stonepeak') acquired a noncontrolling ownership interest in the Company's U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of $3.1 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity (the 'Stonepeak Transaction').",

Our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now have six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. This change aligns with our management structure and better aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on ex isting leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT's Europe property segment experienced tenant billings growth of $47.2 million, driven by contractual escalations, colocations, and newly acquired or constructed sites. This growth directly contributed to a $39.9 million revenue increase in the Europe segment during 2023. In 2024, following AMT's organizational restructuring and the consolidation of its Asia-Pacific and Africa segments into a single reporting unit, the Europe property segment remained a distinct reportable segment with operations in France, Germany, and Spain. The prior year's tenant billing growth likely supported the stability and continued performance of the Europe segment in 2024, despite broader structural changes. The continuation of the Europe segment as a standalone unit indicates its strategic importance and sustained revenue contribution post-restructuring.",

BUSINE SS SE GMENTS\n\n## Property\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company's Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company's data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in seven segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\n\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure -The Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\n\nData Centers - The Company operates 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. The Company's Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the ex isting property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Africa &amp; APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest ex pense, G ain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (ex pense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company's definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') is the Company's chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments' operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management's compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor\n\n## AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)",

      "question": "How did the increase in interest rate on White Oaks Mall's secured indebtedness from 2022 (2.98%) to 2024 (6.98%) impact Simon Property Group's total consolidated secured indebtedness, and what does this shift suggest about their financing strategy for this asset?",
      "answer": "In 2022, White Oaks Mall had a 2.98% interest rate on its secured indebtedness, which rose to 6.98% by 2024. This significant increase in interest rate likely contributed to a higher annual debt service burden for Simon Property Group. Despite the mall's secured debt face amount decreasing from $42,594K to $34,000K, the higher interest rate suggests a more expensive financing structure in 2024. This shift may indicate a strategic move to refinance under different market conditions or a shift in lender risk perception for this asset. Overall, SPG's total consolidated secured indebtedness decreased from $5,366,190K in 2022 to $5,008,769K in 2024, suggesting a broader debt reduction strategy, even as individual property financing terms became less favorable.",

By 2023, SPG's filings showed no Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Award for newer LTIP tranches (2022 and 2023), suggesting a shift in incentive design or performance outcomes. This evolution implies that SPG may have adjusted its long-term incentive strategy, potentially focusing on different performance metrics or experiencing challenges in meeting TSR-based targets.",

By 2024, the company indicated a remaining weighted average amortization period of 20 years for its intangible assets, including other intangibles.

      "answer": "In 2022, the net book value of Acquired Licenses and Other Intangibles was $1,349.5 million as of December 31, 2022. By the end of 2023, this value had decreased to $1,119.1 million as of December 31, 2023. This represents a decline of $230.4 million over the year. The drop in net book value suggests that either AMT accelerated amortization on these assets or made fewer new acquisitions in this category in 2023 compared to prior years. This evolution in the Acquired Licenses and Other Intangibles \u2192 Net Book Value chain reflects a strategic shift or reduced emphasis on this type of intangible asset during the year.",

      "question": "How did AMT's Latin America expansion in 2022 influence its 2023 pass-through revenue structure, particularly in relation to ground rent costs in Brazil?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMT completed the acquisition of over 7,000 communications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina as part of the Telxius Acquisition, which was included in the Latin America property segment. This expansion significantly increased AMT's operational footprint in the region, particularly in Brazil. By 2023, this expansion directly influenced AMT's pass-through revenue structure, as the Latin America property segment reported a $23.8 million increase in pass-through revenue, primarily attributable to increased pass-through ground rent costs in Brazil. This indicates that the 2022 expansion led to higher infrastructure-related expenses in Brazil, which were passed through to tenants in 2023, contributing to the growth in pass-through revenue.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMT(2022) \u2192 Latin America Property Segment: AMT acquired over 7,000 communications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina in 2022 as part of the Telxius Acquisition.",
        "Hop 2: Latin America Property Segment \u2192 Pass-Through Revenue: The 2023 revenue growth in the Latin America segment included a $23.8 million increase in pass-through revenue, primarily due to increased ground rent costs in Brazil.",
        "Hop 3: Pass-Through Revenue \u2190 AMT(2023): In 2023, AMT disclosed that pass-through revenue was used to cover costs such as ground rent, particularly in international markets like Brazil, where these costs had increased."

('Telxius'), a subsidiary of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Telxius' European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing) (the 'Telxius Acquisition'), subject to certain adjustments. In June 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of nearly 20,000 communications sites in Germany and Spain, for total consideration of approximately 6.3 billion EUR (approximately $7.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments and over 7,000 communications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina, for total consideration of approximately 0.9 billion EUR (approximately $1.1 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\n\nOn August 2, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the approximately 4,000 remaining communications sites in Germany pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition for 0.6 billion EUR (approximately $0.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\n\nOf the aggregate purchase price, 233.2 million EUR (approximately $265.2 million), including post-closing adjustments, of deferred payments are due in September 2025 and are reflected in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.

The Telxius Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. Subsequent to the acquisition dates, certain adjustments were made to increase assets by $6.0 million and reduce liabilities by $58.7 million, with a corresponding decrease in goodwill of $64.7 million. There were no other material post-closing adjustments. The full reconciliation and finalization of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including those subject to valuation, have not been completed and, as a result, there may be additional post-closing adjustments.\n\nEntel Acquisition -On December 19, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A.

The Company completed the acquisition of approximately 2,400 communications sites in December 2019 and an additional 530 communications sites pursuant to this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2020. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining 156 communications sites pursuant to this agreement for an aggregate total purchase price of $44.5 million (as of the dates of acquisition), including value added tax, which have been accounted for as an acquisition of assets and are included in the table below in 'Other.'\n\nBangladesh Acquisition -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited ('KTBL') for 900 million Bangladeshi Taka ('BDT') (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing).

      "question": "How did the decline in AMT's straight-line revenue contribution to the Data Centers segment from 2022 to 2023 affect the segment's overall revenue growth and leasing strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMT reported $465.6 million in straight-line revenue, which was a key component of its leasing arrangements and contributed to revenue stability. However, by 2023, the Data Centers segment experienced a $1.1 million decrease in straight-line revenue, signaling a shift in lease dynamics. Despite this decline, the Data Centers segment still achieved $68.1 million in total revenue growth in 2023, driven by increases in rental, power, and interconnection revenue from new leases, customer expansions, and pricing adjustments. This suggests that AMT adapted its leasing strategy to offset the reduction in straight-line revenue by focusing on new customer acquisition and pricing optimization.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMT(2022) \u2192 Straight-Line Revenue: AMT reported $465.6 million in straight-line revenue in 2022, indicating strong reliance on long-term lease contracts with fixed escalation clauses.",
        "Hop 2: Straight-Line Revenue \u2192 Data Centers Segment: By 2023, the Data Centers segment showed a $1.1 million decrease in straight-line revenue, reflecting a contraction in the contribution from long-term lease accounting.",
        "Hop 3: Data Centers Segment \u2190 AMT(2023): Despite the drop in straight-line revenue, the Data Centers segment still grew by $68.1 million in 2023, primarily due to new lease commencements, customer expansions, and power consumption increases."

When determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, the Company must estimate the applicable discount rate and the timing and amount of future cash flows, including rate and terms of renewal and attrition.\n\nRevenue -The Company's revenue is derived from leasing the right to use its communications sites, the land on which the sites are located and its data center facilities (the 'lease component') and from the reimbursement of costs incurred by the Company in operating the communications sites and data center facilities and supporting its customers' equipment as well as other services and contractual rights (the 'non-lease component'). Most of the Company's revenue is derived from leasing arrangements and is accounted for as lease revenue unless the timing and pattern of revenue recognition of the non-lease component differs from the lease component. If the timing and pattern of the non-lease component revenue recognition differs from that of the lease component, the Company separately determines the stand-alone selling prices and pattern of revenue recognition for each performance obligation. Revenue related to DAS networks and fiber and other related assets results from agreements with tenants are generally not accounted for as leases.\n\nThe Company's revenue from leasing arrangements, including fixed escalation clauses present in non-cancellable lease arrangements, is reported on a straight-line basis over the term of the respective leases when collectibility is probable. Escalation clauses tied to a consumer price index ('CPI'), or other inflation-based indices, and other incentives present in lease agreements with the Company's tenants are excluded from the straight-line calculation. Total property straight-line revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $465.6 million, $322.0 million and $183.5 million, respectively.\n\nNon-lease property revenueNon-lease property revenue consists primarily of revenue generated from DAS networks, fiber and other property related revenue. DAS networks and fiber arrangements generally require that the Company provide the tenant the right to use available capacity on the applicable communications infrastructure. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Non-lease property revenue also includes revenue generated from interconnection services in the Company's data center facilities. Interconnection services are generally contracted on a month-to-month basis and are cancellable by the Company or the data center customer at any time. Performance obligations are satisfied over time for the duration of the arrangements. Other property related revenue streams, which include site inspections, are not material on either an individual or consolidated basis.\n\nServices revenueThe Company offers tower-related services in the United States. These services include AZP and structural analysis. There is a single performance obligation related to AZP and revenue is recognized over time based on milestones achieved, which are determined based on costs expected to be incurred. Structural analysis services may have more than one performance obligation, contingent upon the number of contracted services. Revenue is recognized at the point in time the services are completed.\n\nSome of the Company's contracts with customers contain multiple performance obligations. For these arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price, which is typically based on the price charged to customers.\n\nSince most of the Company's contracts are leases, costs to enter into lease arrangements are capitalized under the applicable lease accounting guidance. Costs incurred to obtain non-lease contracts that are capitalized primarily relate to DAS networks and are not material to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has excluded sales tax, value added tax and similar taxes from nonlease revenue.\n\nRevenue is disaggregated by geography in a manner consistent with the Company's business segments, which are discussed further in note 21. A summary of revenue disaggregated by source and geography is as follows:\n\n",

The $1.1 billion reclassification of cumulative translation adjustment in 2024 was directly tied to the earlier year's international divestiture pattern, showing how the financial impact of exiting foreign markets evolved from individual asset sales in 2023 to a comprehensive market exit in 2024.",

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nIn 2023, the Company undertook a strategic review of its India operations, where the Company evaluated the appropriate level of exposure to the India market within its global portfolio of communications assets, and assessed opportunities to repurpose capital to drive long-term shareholder value and sustained growth. The strategic review concluded in January 2024 with the signed agreement for the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined below).\n\nOn January 4, 2024, the Company, through ATC TIPL, entered into an agreement with Data Infrastructure Trust ('DIT'), an infrastructure investment trust sponsored by an affiliate of Brookfield Asset Management, pursuant to which DIT agreed to acquire a 100% ownership interest in ATC TIPL (the 'ATC TIPL Transaction'). Per the terms of the agreement, total aggregate consideration represented up to approximately 210 billion Indian Rupees ('INR') (approximately $2.5 billion), including the value of the VIL OCDs and the VIL Shares (each as defined and further discussed in note 11), payments on certain existing customer receivables, the repayment of existing intercompany debt and the repayment, or assumption, of the Company's existing term loan in India, by DIT.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, ATC TIPL distributed approximately 29.6 billion INR (approximately $354.1 million) to the Company, which included the value of the VIL Shares and the VIL OCDs and the satisfaction of the economic benefit associated with the rights to payments on certain existing customer receivables. The distributions were deducted from the total aggregate consideration received by the Company at closing.\n\nThe ATC TIPL Transaction received all government and regulatory approvals during the three months ended September 30, 2024, and on September 12, 2024, the Company completed the sale of ATC TIPL and received total consideration of 182 billion INR (approximately $2.2 billion). The Company used the proceeds from the ATC TIPL Transaction to repay existing indebtedness under the 2021 Multicurrency Credit Facility.\n\nThe Company recorded a loss on the sale of ATC TIPL of $1.2 billion, which primarily included the reclassification of the Company's cumulative translation adjustment in India upon exiting the market of $1.1 billion. The loss on sale of ATC TIPL is included in Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes in the consolidated statements of operations for year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n",

In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to the Company beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to the Company, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. In the second half of 2023, VIL began making payments in full of its monthly contractual obligations owed to the Company.\n\nThe Company considered these developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under its tenant leases when conducting its 2022 annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets in India. A probability weighted assessment was performed, incorporating current and expected industry and market conditions and trends and, as a result, the Company determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n- An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India.\n- The Company also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million.\n\n## Goodwill Impairments\n\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, as further discussed in note 1.\n\nThe Company concluded that a triggering event occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to its India reporting unit primarily due to indications of value received from third parties in connection with the Company's review of various strategic alternatives for its India operations, which concluded in the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined in note 22). As a result, the Company performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023, using, among other things, the information obtained from third parties to compare the estimated fair value of the India reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The result of the Company's interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT's Data Centers segment revenue increased by $68.1 million, with $31.9 million attributed to rental, related, and other revenue driven by new lease commencements, customer expansions, and rent increases upon renewals. By 2024, this trend accelerated, with rental, related, and other revenue increasing by $56.9 million as part of a total segment revenue growth of $90.1 million, showing a continued strong performance in leasing activity and customer growth. The increase in both years demonstrates a consistent upward trajectory in rental and other revenue, suggesting successful execution of leasing strategies and expansion into new markets.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT's Latin America Property Segment experienced overall revenue growth of $106.4 million, driven by $23.8 million in increased pass-through revenue primarily due to higher ground rent costs in Brazil. By 2024, the segment's revenue declined by $80.4 million, with pass-through revenue growth slowing to $14.5 million. This reduction in pass-through revenue growth coincided with a broader downturn in the segment, influenced heavily by a $79.9 million decrease from foreign currency translation impacts and a $43.9 million drop in other revenue, despite $28.9 million in tenant billings growth.

      "answer": "In 2023, Simon had reserved 55,235,238 shares for potential issuance upon exchange of Operating Partnership units, indicating a mechanism for limited partners to convert their partners' equity into common stock or cash. By 2024, Simon's ownership interest in the Operating Partnership had decreased to 86.5%, with 13.5% held by limited partners. This implies a more defined equity structure with a larger minority stake held externally. The number of shares reserved for issuance increased to 56,002,333 by the end of 2024, suggesting an increased potential for dilution or cash outflow if exchange rights are exercised. The Operating Partnership\u2019s equity structure requires Simon to contribute cash to its partners' equity if it chooses to redeem units for cash, which connects the company\u2019s ownership stake, the partners' equity position, and the dilution risk tied to exchange rights.",

W e  are  structured  as  an  um brella  partnership  R E I T   under  which  substantially  all  of  our  business  is  conducted  through  the Operating P artnership, Sim on's m ajority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Sim on is the general partner. As of D ecem ber 31, 2024,  Sim on  owned  an  approxim ate  86.5%  ownership  interest  in  the  O perating  P artnership,  with  the  rem aining  13.5%  ownership interest  owned  by  lim ited  partners. As  the  sole  general  partner  of  the  O perating  P artnership,  S im on  has  exclusive  control  of  the Operating P artnership's day-to-day m anagem ent.\n\nWe operate Sim on and the O perating P artnership as one business. T he m anagem ent of Sim on consists of the sam e m em bers as the m anagem ent of the O perating P artnership. As general partner with control of the O perating P artnership, Sim on consolidates the Operating P artnership for financial reporting purposes, and Sim on has no m aterial assets or liabilities other than its investm ent in the Operating P artnership. T herefore, the assets and liabilities of Sim on and the O perating P artnership are the sam e on their respective financial statem ents.\n\nWe believe  that  com bining  the  annual  reports  on  F orm   10-K  of  S im on  and  the  O perating  P artnership  into  this  single  report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Sim on and the O perating P artnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the sam e m anner as m anagem ent views and operates the business;\n- elim inates duplicative disclosure and provides a m ore stream lined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Sim on and the O perating P artnership; and\n- creates tim e and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one com bined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is im portant for investors to understand the few differences between Sim on and the O perating P artnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated com pany. T he prim ary difference is that Sim on itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the O perating P artnership and issuing equity or equity-related instrum ents from  tim e to tim e. I n addition, Sim on itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the O perating P artnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the O perating P artnership.\n\nThe Operating P artnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. T he O perating P artnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. E xcept for the net proceeds from  equity issuances by Sim on, which are contributed to the capital of the O perating P artnership in exchange for, in the case of com m on stock issuances by Sim on, com m on units of partnership interest in the O perating P artnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances by Sim on, preferred units of partnership interest in the O perating P artnership, or preferred units, the O perating P artnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from  the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the m ain areas of difference between the consolidated financial statem ents of Sim on and those of the O perating P artnership. T he differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from  differences in the equity issued at the Sim on and O perating P artnership levels. T he units held by lim ited partners in the O perating P artnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the O perating P artnership's financial statem ents and as noncontrolling interests in Sim on's financial statem ents. T he noncontrolling interests in the O perating P artnership's financial statem ents include  the  interests  of  unaffiliated  partners  in  various  consolidated  partnerships.

      "answer": "In 2022, the gross carrying value of AMT's acquired licenses and other intangibles was $1,807.9 million as of December 31, 2021, while in 2024, the gross carrying value for the same category had decreased to $1,406.8 million as of December 31, 2023. This represents a reduction of $401.1 million, or about 22.2%. This decline suggests that AMT may have reduced its investment in or write-downs of acquired licenses and other intangibles over this period. The change could also reflect strategic decisions to divest or re-evaluate the value of certain intangible assets, especially given the shift in estimated useful lives from a range of 2\u201320 years in 2022 to 2\u201330 years in 2024, indicating a potential long-term shift in asset management or amortization strategy.",

      "question": "How did Simon Property Group's ownership structure of the Operating Partnership evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what were the implications for Partners' Equity treatment, tax risk exposure, and limited partners' exchange rights?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Simon owned 87.4% of the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 12.6% held by limited partners, and the structure carried significant tax risk if the Operating Partnership failed to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. This ownership structure directly influenced Partners' Equity treatment, as the units held by limited partners were classified as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership\u2019s financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon\u2019s financial statements. By 2024, Simon maintained the ability to determine whether limited partners' exchange rights for units would be settled in stock or cash, with the latter requiring a corresponding cash contribution to the Operating Partnership as partners' equity. This evolution highlights a continuation of the structural interdependence between Simon and the Operating Partnership, while maintaining the potential tax risk associated with the REIT status should the Operating Partnership's partnership status be challenged. The 2024 disclosure also reaffirmed the one-for-one exchange mechanism, ensuring alignment between Simon's equity and the Operating Partnership\u2019s partners' equity.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Simon' mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the 'Operating Partnership' mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to 'we,' 'us' and 'our' mean collectively  Simon,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  those  entities/subsidiaries  owned  or  controlled  by  Simon and/or the Operating Partnership.\n\nSimon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  remaining  12.6%  ownership  interest  owned  by  limited  partners.  As  the  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership,  Simon  consolidates  the  Operating  Partnership  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  and  Simon  has  no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\nWe believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and\n- creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances  by  Simon,  preferred  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership,  or  preferred  units,  the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference  between  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Simon  and  those  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership's financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by  limited  partners  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  Although  classified  differently,  total  equity  of  Simon  and  the Operating Partnership is the same.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Simon  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  this  report provides:\n\n- separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;",

By 2024, SPG continued to classify these preferred units as temporary equity due to the potential redemption in cash, and the redemption value remained tied to the same terms. Additionally, SPG repurchased 1,273,733 shares in 2023 and 1,830,022 shares in 2022, with the Operating Partnership repurchasing an equal number of units from SPG. This indicates that while the redemption features remained consistent, the actual redemption risk fluctuated with SPG's share repurchase activity, influencing the temporary equity classification and signaling ongoing exposure to cash redemption obligations.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

This series of preferred units accrues cumulative quarterly distributions at a rate of $7.50 annually. The preferred units are redeemable by the Operating Partnership upon the death of the survivor of the original holders, or the transfer of any preferred units to any person or entity other than the persons or entities entitled to the benefits of the original holder. The redemption price is the liquidation value ($100.00 per preferred unit) plus accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or fully registered shares of common stock  at  our  election.  In  the  event  of  the  death  of  a  holder  of  the  preferred  units,  the  occurrence  of  certain  tax triggering events applicable to the holder, or on or after November 10, 2006, the holder may require the Operating Partnership  to  redeem  the  preferred  units  at  the  same  redemption  price  payable  at  the  option  of  the  Operating Partnership in either cash or shares of common stock.  These preferred units have a carrying value of $25.5 million and are included in limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## The Operating Partnership\n\nThe Operating Partnership classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that the Operating Partnership could be required to redeem the security for cash, irrespective of the probability of such a possibility.    As  a  result,  the  Operating  Partnership  classifies  one  series  of  preferred  units  and  noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity.  Each of these securities is discussed further below.\n\nNoncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties Redeemable instruments, which typically represent the remaining noncontrolling interests in a property or portfolio of properties, and which are redeemable at the option of  the  holder  or  in  circumstances  that  may  be  outside  our  control,  are  accounted  for  as  temporary  equity.    The carrying  amount  of  the  noncontrolling  interest  is  adjusted  to  the  redemption  amount  assuming  the  instrument  is redeemable at the balance sheet date.  Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded  within  equity  and  are  presented  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  equity  in  the  line  issuance  of  unit equivalents and other.  There are no noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of December  31,  2021  and  2020.    The  following  table  summarizes  the  preferred  units  and  the  amount  of  the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT disclosed $2,325.0 million in encumbrances, which represented the face value of mortgage debt but explicitly excluded any deferred financing costs. Despite this exclusion, AMT amortized $49.8 million of deferred financing costs in 2023, indicating that while the principal debt amounts (encumbrances) did not directly include these costs, the financing activities associated with those debts still generated deferred costs that required amortization. This shows that the scale of encumbrances indirectly influenced the level of deferred financing costs being amortized in the following year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the carrying value of the 7.50% Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Units in the Operating Partnership was $25.5 million and was included in limited partners' preferred interest in the consolidated balance sheets. By 2023, the redemption features of these preferred units remained classified outside permanent equity due to potential cash settlement provisions. Additionally, the 2023 disclosures indicate that changes in redemption value for redeemable noncontrolling interests were recorded within accumulated deficit, showing a shift in accounting treatment compared to 2022, where changes were presented in the line item 'issuance of unit equivalents and other.' This evolution suggests SPG adjusted its capital structure by managing redemption risks and refining equity classification strategies over the two-year period.",

        "Hop 2: Operating Partnership \u2192 Changes in Redemption Value: The 2022 document explicitly disclosed how changes in redemption value for preferred units and noncontrolling interests were accounted for within equity and presented in the consolidated statements of equity.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.  In  general,  prohibited transactions",

This series of preferred units accrues cumulative quarterly distributions at a rate of $7.50 annually. The preferred units are redeemable by the Operating Partnership upon the death of the survivor of the original holders, or the transfer of any preferred units to any person or entity other than the persons or entities entitled to the benefits of the original holder. The redemption price is the liquidation value ($100.00 per preferred unit) plus accrued and unpaid distributions, payable either in cash or fully registered shares of common stock  at  our  election.  In  the  event  of  the  death  of  a  holder  of  the  preferred  units,  the  occurrence  of  certain  tax triggering events applicable to the holder, or on or after November 10, 2006, the holder may require the Operating Partnership  to  redeem  the  preferred  units  at  the  same  redemption  price  payable  at  the  option  of  the  Operating Partnership in either cash or shares of common stock.  These preferred units have a carrying value of $25.5 million and are included in limited partners' preferred interest in the Operating Partnership in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## The Operating Partnership\n\nThe Operating Partnership classifies as temporary equity those securities for which there is the possibility that the Operating Partnership could be required to redeem the security for cash, irrespective of the probability of such a possibility.    As  a  result,  the  Operating  Partnership  classifies  one  series  of  preferred  units  and  noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties in temporary equity.  Each of these securities is discussed further below.\n\nNoncontrolling Redeemable Interests in Properties Redeemable instruments, which typically represent the remaining noncontrolling interests in a property or portfolio of properties, and which are redeemable at the option of  the  holder  or  in  circumstances  that  may  be  outside  our  control,  are  accounted  for  as  temporary  equity.    The carrying  amount  of  the  noncontrolling  interest  is  adjusted  to  the  redemption  amount  assuming  the  instrument  is redeemable at the balance sheet date.  Changes in the redemption value of the underlying noncontrolling interest are recorded  within  equity  and  are  presented  in  the  consolidated  statements  of  equity  in  the  line  issuance  of  unit equivalents and other.  There are no noncontrolling interests redeemable at amounts in excess of fair value as of December  31,  2021  and  2020.    The  following  table  summarizes  the  preferred  units  and  the  amount  of  the noncontrolling redeemable interests in properties as of December 31.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMT experienced a $0.7 million decline in other tenant billings within the Europe property segment, partially offset by a $9.9 million increase in other revenue driven by the Spain fiber business acquired in Q2 2022. Despite this decline, Europe property segment revenue grew by $39.9 million overall, driven by tenant billings growth of $47.2 million. By 2024, AMT maintained its property operations in Europe, operating in France, Germany, and Spain, indicating a continued strategic commitment to the region. This suggests that the broader growth in tenant billings and the addition of the Spain fiber business were sufficient to justify ongoing investment and operations in Europe in 2024.",

BUSINE SS SE GMENTS\n\n## Property\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company's Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company's data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in seven segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\n\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure -The Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\n\nData Centers - The Company operates 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. The Company's Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the ex isting property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Africa &amp; APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest ex pense, G ain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (ex pense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company's definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') is the Company's chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments' operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management's compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor\n\n## AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMT included newly acquired Latin American properties into its portfolio as part of the Telxius Acquisition, which significantly expanded its footprint in the region. By 2023, this segment contributed $20.2 million to tenant billings growth through contractual escalations, net of churn. This demonstrates that the prior year's acquisition activity directly fueled revenue increases in the Latin America property segment the following year through built-in contractual rent escalations. The $20.2 million figure specifically highlights how acquisitions from 2022 translated into measurable revenue growth in 2023 through ongoing contractual mechanisms rather than new leasing activity.",

('Telxius'), a subsidiary of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Telxius' European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing) (the 'Telxius Acquisition'), subject to certain adjustments. In June 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of nearly 20,000 communications sites in Germany and Spain, for total consideration of approximately 6.3 billion EUR (approximately $7.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments and over 7,000 communications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina, for total consideration of approximately 0.9 billion EUR (approximately $1.1 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\n\nOn August 2, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the approximately 4,000 remaining communications sites in Germany pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition for 0.6 billion EUR (approximately $0.7 billion at the date of closing), subject to certain post-closing adjustments.\n\nOf the aggregate purchase price, 233.2 million EUR (approximately $265.2 million), including post-closing adjustments, of deferred payments are due in September 2025 and are reflected in Other non-current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The acquired operations in Germany and Spain are included in the Europe property segment and the acquired operations in Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina are included in the Latin America property segment. The Telxius Acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and is subject to post-closing adjustments. Subsequent to the acquisition dates, certain adjustments were made to increase assets by $6.0 million and reduce liabilities by $58.7 million, with a corresponding decrease in goodwill of $64.7 million. There were no other material post-closing adjustments. The full reconciliation and finalization of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including those subject to valuation, have not been completed and, as a result, there may be additional post-closing adjustments.\n\nEntel Acquisition -On December 19, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire approximately 3,200 communications sites in Chile and Peru from Entel PCS Telecomunicaciones S.A. and Entel Peru S.A.

      "question": "How did SPG's indebtedness structure evolve from 2022 to 2023 through its Operating Partnership, and what were the implications for its consolidated financial position?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SPG relied on the Operating Partnership's structure as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which allowed it to avoid corporate-level taxation and pass income directly to partners, including SPG itself. This structure was critical to maintaining REIT status and optimizing cash flow for debt service and distributions. By 2023, the Operating Partnership had become the primary vehicle for incurring indebtedness, with SPG itself not directly holding any debt. The consolidated financial statements reflected this structure, with all debt obligations tied to the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries. This evolution allowed SPG to maintain a streamlined capital structure while leveraging the Operating Partnership\u2019s ability to generate capital through operations, debt issuance, and equity contributions.

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.  In  general,  prohibited transactions",

      "answer": "In 2022, Wolfchase Galleria had secured indebtedness of $155.15 million at a 4.15% interest rate. By 2024, while Wolfchase Galleria's debt remained outstanding with the same maturity date (11/01/26), SPG's broader secured indebtedness portfolio showed a strategic shift toward lower interest rates. For example, new financings like Noventa Di Piave Designer Outlet at 2.00% and Parndorf Designer Outlet at 2.00% in 2024 contrasted with higher-rate obligations like Shops at Chestnut Hill at 6.66%. The average interest rate on SPG's secured debt decreased from 4.15% (Wolfchase Galleria in 2022) to a blended rate that included multiple sub-4% financings in 2024, indicating a refinancing strategy to reduce interest costs.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG's 'Other Expense' increased by $32.7 million, primarily due to higher legal fees and expenses. This reflects event-driven or one-time costs associated with legal matters. By 2023, while the specific mention of legal fees was absent, 'Other Expense' continued to include recurring operational costs like ground lease payments across 23 consolidated properties with lease termination dates extending through 2090. This suggests a potential shift from event-driven legal costs in 2022 to more stable, operationally driven expenses like ground leases in 2023, though both were classified under the same 'Other Expense' category.",

During 2019, we recorded net gains of $62.1 million primarily related to Kl\u00e9pierre's disposition of certain shopping centers, offset by a $47.2 million impairment charge related to an unconsolidated investment.\n\nSimon's net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $156.8 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nBecause we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. Floating rate debt comprised only 7.6% of our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2021. We also enter into  interest  rate  protection  agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity  from  positive  net  cash  flow  from  operations  and  distributions  of  capital  from  unconsolidated  entities  that totaled $3.9 billion in the aggregate during 2021. The Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below.\n\nOur  balance  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  decreased  $477.7  million  during  2021  to  $533.9  million  as  of December 31, 2021 as further discussed below.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately $5.8 billion under the  Facilities,  net  of  outstanding  borrowings  of  $1.18  billion,  amounts  outstanding  under  the  Commercial  Paper program of $500.0 million and letters of credit of $11.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the maximum aggregate  outstanding  balance  under  the  Credit  Facilities  was  $2.1  billion  and  the  weighted  average  outstanding balance was $519.9 million. The weighted average interest rate was 0.85% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nSimon has historically had access to public equity markets and the Operating Partnership has historically had access to private and public, short and long-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level.\n\nOur business model and Simon's status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. Simon may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facilities  and  the  Commercial  Paper  program  to  address  our  debt maturities and capital needs through 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed that the 2021 LTIP program had a Grant Date Target Value of Performance-Based Awards of $12.2 million, which was part of a broader compensation framework involving multiple LTIP tranches. By 2023, this figure remained unchanged at $12.2 million for the 2021 LTIP awards, even as newer LTIP programs (2022 and 2023) showed increasing values of $13.7 million and $23.6 million respectively. This suggests that while the 2021 program's value remained stable, SPG's overall long-term incentive strategy saw a significant upward trend in performance-based award values over time, potentially reflecting increased confidence or more aggressive compensation targets.",

      "answer": "In 2023, SPG reported $73,020 million in Quoted Prices in Active Markets Level 1 as part of its Other Assets, which contributed to the fair value methodology used for financial instruments. By 2024, Quoted Prices in Active Markets Level 1 increased to $89,871 million within Deferred Costs and Other Assets, reflecting a stronger reliance on actively traded market prices for asset valuation. This shift coincided with a decline in the fair value of interest rate hedge instruments, which fell from $11.6 million in 2023 to $6.1 million in 2024, indicating a reduced hedge position or market value fluctuation. The increased emphasis on Level 1 pricing likely improved transparency in Deferred Costs and Other Assets, but the drop in hedge instrument value suggests potential exposure to interest rate volatility despite risk management strategies.",

By 2024, AMT's ownership in ATC Europe had increased, and ATC Europe C.V. declared and paid aggregate dividends of 422.5 million EUR (approximately $465.1 million), distributed among AMT, CDPQ, and Allianz per their respective equity interests. The significant increase in dividend amounts\u2014from $16.2 million in 2022 to $465.1 million in 2024\u2014corresponds with AMT\u2019s increased control and evolving partnership structure within ATC Europe, suggesting a greater capacity and willingness to return capital to stakeholders as its influence expanded.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SPG disclosed that Wolfchase Galleria had a secured indebtedness of $155,152 with an interest rate of 4.15%, contributing to SPG\u2019s broader secured debt portfolio. This level of secured debt influenced SPG\u2019s financing strategy in 2023, where the company maintained a $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, indicating a strategic shift toward unsecured borrowing to maintain financial flexibility and comply with debt-to-asset covenants. The presence of secured debt like that of Wolfchase Galleria likely reinforced the need for a larger unsecured facility to balance debt structure and maintain investment-grade credit ratings.",

        "Hop 2: Wolfchase Galleria \u2192 Secured Indebtedness: Wolfchase Galleria was listed among other properties with secured debt, contributing to SPG\u2019s total secured indebtedness.",

      "question": "How did SPG's secured indebtedness tied to Williamsburg Premium Outlets in 2022 influence its borrowing capacity and financing flexibility in 2023, particularly in relation to the $5.0 billion unsecured credit facility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SPG had a secured indebtedness of $185 million tied to Williamsburg Premium Outlets at an interest rate of 4.23%, which contributed to its overall secured debt obligations. By 2023, SPG maintained a $5.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility, with the ability to increase it to $6.0 billion, indicating that while secured debt like that from Williamsburg remained on its balance sheet, the company retained significant unsecured borrowing capacity. The presence of secured obligations such as Williamsburg\u2019s debt likely influenced SPG\u2019s financing flexibility by constraining the secured debt ratio covenant (limited to 50% of total assets), thereby shaping its ability to take on additional secured borrowings and directing new financing toward unsecured instruments.",

        "Hop 1: SPG(2022) \u2192 Williamsburg Premium Outlets: SPG fully owned Williamsburg Premium Outlets in 2022, a key asset in its premium outlets portfolio.",

      "question": "How did SPG's treatment of TSR awards in its LTIP programs change between the 2019 program disclosed in 2022 and the newer awards disclosed in 2023, particularly regarding the relationship between Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Awards and performance-based compensation?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SPG's disclosure showed the 2019 LTIP program had a Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Award of $9.5 million, which was part of a total performance-based award value of $14.7 million\u2014indicating the TSR component represented about 64.6% of the performance-based award value. By 2023, newer LTIP awards (2022 and 2023 programs) no longer included a TSR award component at all, as noted by the absence of values under 'Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Award' for these programs. This represents a complete shift away from including TSR awards in LTIP programs, signaling a strategic change in SPG's executive compensation structure. Total performance-based awards increased to $13.7 million for the 2022 LTIP and $23.6 million for the 2023 LTIP, suggesting SPG may have reallocated compensation emphasis toward other forms of performance-based incentives, excluding TSR-linked awards.",

        "Hop 1: SPG(2022) \u2192 2019 LTIP program: SPG disclosed details about the 2019 LTIP program in its 2022 filing, including that it had a Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Award of $9.5 million.",
        "Hop 2: 2019 LTIP program \u2192 Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Award: The 2019 LTIP program specifically included a TSR award component with a value of $9.5 million, compared to a total performance-based award value of $14.7 million.",
        "Hop 3: Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Award \u2190 SPG(2023): In the 2023 filing, SPG disclosed newer LTIP awards (2022 and 2023 programs) that no longer included any TSR award components, as evidenced by the absence of values in the 'Grant Date Fair Value of TSR Award' column for these programs."

      "answer": "The 2022 Telxius Acquisition significantly expanded AMT's Europe Property Segment by adding nearly 20,000 communications sites in Germany and Spain (valued at \u20ac6.3 billion). This acquisition directly contributed to the Europe Property Segment's 2023 revenue growth, with $25.8 million of the tenant billings increase attributed to contractual escalations, net of churn. This amount was a key component of the segment's overall $39.9 million revenue growth in 2023. The acquired sites provided a larger revenue base subject to contractual escalation clauses, enabling AMT to realize this increase. For comparison, colocations and amendments contributed $13.6 million to tenant billings growth, while newly acquired or constructed sites added $8.5 million, indicating that contractual escalations remained the most significant growth driver within the segment.",

('Telxius'), a subsidiary of Telef\u00f3nica, S.A., pursuant to which the Company agreed to acquire Telxius' European and Latin American tower divisions, comprising approximately 31,000 communications sites in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Germany, Peru and Spain, for approximately 7.7 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $9.4 billion at the date of signing) (the 'Telxius Acquisition'), subject to certain adjustments.

The 2022 explanatory note clarified that Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, and all debt is carried by the Operating Partnership or its subsidiaries (chunk 2). By 2023, the consolidated financial statements in Note 7 showed the total indebtedness levels, reflecting the financing decisions made through the Operating Partnership structure. Therefore, the capital decisions made in 2022 directly influenced the composition and total amount of indebtedness disclosed in 2023, as the Operating Partnership remained the sole vehicle for debt financing.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Simon' mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the 'Operating Partnership' mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to 'we,' 'us' and 'our' mean collectively  Simon,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  those  entities/subsidiaries  owned  or  controlled  by  Simon and/or the Operating Partnership.\n\nSimon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  remaining  12.6%  ownership  interest  owned  by  limited  partners.  As  the  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership,  Simon  consolidates  the  Operating  Partnership  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  and  Simon  has  no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\nWe believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and\n- creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances  by  Simon,  preferred  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership,  or  preferred  units,  the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference  between  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Simon  and  those  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership's financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by  limited  partners  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  Although  classified  differently,  total  equity  of  Simon  and  the Operating Partnership is the same.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Simon  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  this  report provides:\n\n- separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Latin America property segment experienced a $23.8 million increase in pass-through revenue, primarily due to rising ground rent costs in Brazil. This increase contributed to the segment\u2019s overall revenue growth of $106.4 million. Despite these cost pressures, AMT did not divest or consolidate the Latin America segment during the 2024 reorganization, unlike the Africa and Asia-Pacific segments which were merged. Instead, AMT maintained Latin America as a standalone reportable segment with operations spanning Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay, and Peru. This decision suggests that the company viewed the Latin American market, despite its cost volatility, as strategically important and operationally resilient enough to remain independent in its post-reorganization structure.",

BUSINE SS SE GMENTS\n\n## Property\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company's Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company's data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in seven segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\n\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure -The Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\n\nData Centers - The Company operates 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. The Company's Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the ex isting property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Africa &amp; APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest ex pense, G ain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (ex pense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company's definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') is the Company's chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments' operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management's compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor\n\n## AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)",
