      "question": "How did Linde's environmental protection costs and strategic positioning around climate change evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's risk mitigation and growth strategy in response to regulatory pressures?",
      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Linde consistently reported that its environmental protection costs were not significant, with no material adverse impact expected on its financial position or operations. In 2022, Linde emphasized its ability to mitigate GHG regulation costs through product supply contracts and highlighted opportunities in hydrogen and emissions-reducing technologies. By 2023, the company expanded on its proactive risk management framework, including GHG provisions in commercial agreements, contingency planning, and monitoring regulatory developments, while also noting the potential for increased costs from climate change regulation. In 2024, Linde reiterated that environmental expenditures remained in line with prior years and would not materially impact financials, while continuing to focus on new market opportunities tied to decarbonization and water treatment regulations. This consistent messaging shows a stable cost profile but an evolving strategic emphasis on leveraging environmental trends for growth, particularly in hydrogen and clean energy solutions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncontinues to  develop  new  applications  that  can  help  customers  lower  emissions  by  reducing  energy  consumption  and  increasing  product  throughput.  Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\n\n## Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment\n\nThe environmental protection costs incurred in 2024 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2024,  subject  to  any  significant  changes  in  ex isting  laws  and  regulations.  Based  on  historical  results  and  current  estimates,  management  does  not  believe  that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\nPensions\n\nThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) was a benefit of $106 million, $80 million and $110 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a surplus of $86 million and deficit of $137 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The funded status for non-U.S. plans was a surplus of $464 million and deficit of $207 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, the U.S. and non U.S plans derived a benefit from actuarial gains due to higher discount rate environment.\n\nGlobal pension contributions were $35 million in 2024, $46 million in 2023, and $51 million in 2022. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2025 are currently expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million.\n\nLinde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2025 of 7.00% and 6.02% for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios.\n\nExcluding the impact of any settlements, 2025 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $145 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses.\n\nRefer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company's retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and funded status.\n\n## Insurance\n\nLinde  purchases  insurance  to  limit  a  variety  of  property  and  casualty  risks,  including  those  related  to  property,  business  interruption,  third-party  liability  and workers' compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States and $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. Through December 31, 2024, the company self retained risk up to \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils affecting its properties along with a separate \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million deductible on business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. As of January 1, 2025 Linde has a captive insurance company that provides coverage for up to $50 million per event, and $100 million, in the annual aggregate, of losses above local deductibles for property damage and business interruption at the group's sites globally. To mitigate the risk of losses above these self retention levels, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLinde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business due to increased focus on lowering GHG emissions. Traditionally, hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.\n\nTo manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change.\n\nLinde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG emissions through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency, sourcing renewable energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde tracks GHG emission performance versus targets and reports regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. Effective November 2021, a new Sustainability Committee was created. The Committee is responsible for Board oversight of the Company's programs, policies and strategies related to environmental matters generally, including climate change, greenhouse gas reduction goals and decarbonization solutions, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.\n\nAt the same time, external factors may provide Linde with future business opportunities. Examples of such factors include governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\n\n## Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment\n\nEnvironmental protection costs in 2021 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2021, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was a benefit of $35 million and $28 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and costs of $107 million in 2019. 2019 net periodic pension cost included pension settlement charges of $97  million  related  to  lump  sum  payments,  which  were  triggered  by  either  a  change  in  control  provision  or  merger-related divestitures,  and  a  net  curtailment  charge  of  $8  million  for  termination  benefits,  primarily  in  connection  with  a  defined  benefit pension plan freeze. Settlement charges were $4 million and $6 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $135 million  and  $436  million  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  The  funded  status  for  non-U.S.  plans  was  a  deficit  of $1,409 million and $2,334 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Both the U.S. and non-U.S.",

      "answer": "Linde's non-U.S. borrowings were $243 million in 2022, increased to $226 million in 2023, and then decreased to $214 million in 2024. This represents a 12% decline from 2022 to 2024, after a slight decrease in 2023. The trend suggests a gradual reduction in reliance on non-U.S. borrowings, which may reflect a strategic recalibration of the company's capital structure or adjustments in currency risk management. However, the relatively small magnitude of change indicates that the company's exposure to non-U.S. borrowings has remained broadly stable as a component of its overall debt profile.",

Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde U.S. Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time irrevocable choice between a traditional benefit (the 'Traditional Design') and an accountbased benefit (the 'Account-Based Design'). The Traditional Design pays a monthly benefit based on years of service and average pay during the last years of the participant's career with Linde. The Account-Based Design gives participants annual pay credits equal to 4% of eligible compensation, plus interest credits based on long-term treasury rates on the accumulated account balance. This new formula applies to all new employees hired after April 30, 2002 into businesses adopting this plan.  The  U.S.  pension  plan  assets  are  comprised  of  a  diversified  mix   of  investments,  including  corporate  equities,  government  securities  and  corporate  debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary retirement benefits primarily to higher level employees that are unfunded and are nonqualified for federal tax  purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde's non-U.S. subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through separate plans. Obligations under such plans are primarily provided for through diversified investment portfolios, with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans - Non-U.S.\n\nLinde has Non-U.S., defined benefit commitments primarily in G ermany and the U.K that include pension plan assets comprised of a diversified mix of investments. The defined benefit commitments in G ermany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the  performance  of  the  corresponding  investment.  There  are  no  minimum  funding  requirements.  The  pension  obligations  in  G ermany  are  partly  funded  by  a Contractual Trust Agreement. Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted.\n\n## Multi-employer Pension Plans\n\nIn the United States Linde participates in eight multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (\"MEPs\"), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, that cover approximately 200 union-represented employees.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Linde consistently reported that environmental protection costs were not significant and expected to remain stable, with no material adverse effects anticipated on financial position or cash flows. However, the company's strategic emphasis on leveraging climate change regulations to create business opportunities evolved significantly. In 2022, Linde highlighted hydrogen and carbon capture as decarbonization solutions and noted opportunities in wastewater treatment and desalination due to stricter regulations. By 2023, the company expanded its focus on physical climate risks and regulatory uncertainty, noting increased costs of energy due to GHG regulations and its contractual mechanisms to recover these costs. In 2024, Linde reinforced its position in clean technologies and emphasized growth in hydrogen sales, while also benefiting from a more favorable pension funding status, suggesting improved financial flexibility to support long-term sustainability initiatives.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLinde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business due to increased focus on lowering GHG emissions. Traditionally, hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.\n\nTo manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change.\n\nLinde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG emissions through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency, sourcing renewable energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde tracks GHG emission performance versus targets and reports regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. Effective November 2021, a new Sustainability Committee was created. The Committee is responsible for Board oversight of the Company's programs, policies and strategies related to environmental matters generally, including climate change, greenhouse gas reduction goals and decarbonization solutions, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.\n\nAt the same time, external factors may provide Linde with future business opportunities. Examples of such factors include governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\n\n## Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment\n\nEnvironmental protection costs in 2021 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2021, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was a benefit of $35 million and $28 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and costs of $107 million in 2019. 2019 net periodic pension cost included pension settlement charges of $97  million  related  to  lump  sum  payments,  which  were  triggered  by  either  a  change  in  control  provision  or  merger-related divestitures,  and  a  net  curtailment  charge  of  $8  million  for  termination  benefits,  primarily  in  connection  with  a  defined  benefit pension plan freeze. Settlement charges were $4 million and $6 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $135 million  and  $436  million  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  The  funded  status  for  non-U.S.  plans  was  a  deficit  of $1,409 million and $2,334 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Both the U.S. and non-U.S.",

Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\n\n## Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment\n\nThe environmental protection costs incurred in 2024 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2024,  subject  to  any  significant  changes  in  ex isting  laws  and  regulations.  Based  on  historical  results  and  current  estimates,  management  does  not  believe  that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\nPensions\n\nThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) was a benefit of $106 million, $80 million and $110 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a surplus of $86 million and deficit of $137 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The funded status for non-U.S. plans was a surplus of $464 million and deficit of $207 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, the U.S. and non U.S plans derived a benefit from actuarial gains due to higher discount rate environment.\n\nGlobal pension contributions were $35 million in 2024, $46 million in 2023, and $51 million in 2022. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2025 are currently expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million.\n\nLinde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2025 of 7.00% and 6.02% for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios.\n\nExcluding the impact of any settlements, 2025 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $145 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses.\n\nRefer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company's retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and funded status.\n\n## Insurance\n\nLinde  purchases  insurance  to  limit  a  variety  of  property  and  casualty  risks,  including  those  related  to  property,  business  interruption,  third-party  liability  and workers' compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States and $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. Through December 31, 2024, the company self retained risk up to \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils affecting its properties along with a separate \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million deductible on business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. As of January 1, 2025 Linde has a captive insurance company that provides coverage for up to $50 million per event, and $100 million, in the annual aggregate, of losses above local deductibles for property damage and business interruption at the group's sites globally. To mitigate the risk of losses above these self retention levels, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies.",

      "answer": "LIN's Engineering Segment Sales began at $2,867 million in 2022, declined to $2,160 million in 2023, and then increased by $162 million (or 8%) in 2024. This trajectory reveals a volatile pattern, with a significant drop followed by partial recovery. The volatility suggests potential instability in the segment, influenced by factors such as project timing and geopolitical issues like the wind-down of sanctioned projects in Russia. This evolution indicates a shifting strategic focus or external pressures affecting the segment\u2019s performance across the three-year period.",

The Traditional Design pays a monthly benefit based on years of service and average pay during the last years of the participant's career with Linde. The Account-Based Design gives participants annual pay credits equal to 4% of eligible compensation, plus interest credits based on long-term treasury rates on the accumulated account balance. This new formula applies to all new employees hired after  April  30,  2002  into  businesses  adopting  this  plan.  The  U.S.  pension  plan  assets  are  comprised  of  a  diversified  mix  of investments, including corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary  retirement  benefits  primarily  to  higher  level  employees  that  are  unfunded  and  are  nonqualified  for  federal  tax purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde's non-U.S. subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through  separate  plans.

These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the  performance  of  the  corresponding  investment.  There  are  no  minimum  funding  requirements.  The  pension  obligations  in Germany are partly funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service.

In 2022, Linde highlighted its proactive monitoring of GHG-related risks and mitigation through contract terms. By 2023, the company expanded its discussion on exposure to carbon taxation and cap-and-trade systems in multiple jurisdictions, and reiterated its ability to recover increased energy costs through long-term contracts. In 2024, Linde continued to emphasize the development of low-emission technologies and noted growing market opportunities from stricter environmental regulations, particularly in wastewater treatment and desalination.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLinde anticipates continued growth in its hydrogen business due to increased focus on lowering GHG emissions. Traditionally, hydrogen production plants and a large number of other manufacturing and electricity-generating plants have been identified in California and the European Union as a source of carbon dioxide emissions and these plants are subject to cap-and-trade regulations in those jurisdictions. Linde believes it will be able to mitigate the costs of these regulations through the terms of its product supply contracts. However, legislation that limits GHG emissions may impact growth by increasing capital, compliance, operating and maintenance costs and/or decreasing demand.\n\nTo manage business risks from current and potential GHG emission regulation as well as physical consequences of climate change, Linde actively monitors current developments, evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, and takes appropriate actions. Among others, actions include: increasing relevant resources and training; maintaining contingency plans; obtaining advice and counsel from expert vendors, insurance providers and industry experts; incorporating GHG provisions in commercial agreements; and conducting regular reviews of the business risks with management. Although there are considerable uncertainties, Linde believes that the business risk from potential regulations can be effectively managed through its commercial contracts. Additionally, Linde does not anticipate any material effects regarding its plant operations or business arising from potential physical risks of climate change.\n\nLinde continuously seeks opportunities to optimize energy use and GHG emissions through research and development in customer applications and rigorous operational energy efficiency, sourcing renewable energy, and purchasing hydrogen as a chemical byproduct where feasible. Linde tracks GHG emission performance versus targets and reports regularly to business management and annually to Linde's Board of Directors. Effective November 2021, a new Sustainability Committee was created. The Committee is responsible for Board oversight of the Company's programs, policies and strategies related to environmental matters generally, including climate change, greenhouse gas reduction goals and decarbonization solutions, such as clean hydrogen and carbon capture.\n\nAt the same time, external factors may provide Linde with future business opportunities. Examples of such factors include governmental regulation of GHG and other emissions; uncertain costs of energy and certain natural resources; the development of renewable energy alternatives; and new technologies that help extract natural gas, improve air quality, increase energy efficiency and mitigate the impacts of climate change. Linde continues to develop new applications that can lower emissions and help customers lower energy consumption and increase product throughput. Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\n\n## Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment\n\nEnvironmental protection costs in 2021 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2021, subject to any significant changes in existing laws and regulations. Based on historical results and current estimates, management does not believe that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\n## Pensions\n\nThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) for the U.S. and non-U.S. pension plans was a benefit of $35 million and $28 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and costs of $107 million in 2019. 2019 net periodic pension cost included pension settlement charges of $97  million  related  to  lump  sum  payments,  which  were  triggered  by  either  a  change  in  control  provision  or  merger-related divestitures,  and  a  net  curtailment  charge  of  $8  million  for  termination  benefits,  primarily  in  connection  with  a  defined  benefit pension plan freeze. Settlement charges were $4 million and $6 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a deficit of $135 million  and  $436  million  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  The  funded  status  for  non-U.S.  plans  was  a  deficit  of $1,409 million and $2,334 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Both the U.S. and non-U.S.",

Stricter regulation of water quality in emerging economies such as China provide a growing market for a number of gases, e.g., oxygen for wastewater treatment. Increased concern about drought in areas such as California and Australia may create additional markets for carbon dioxide for desalination. Renewable fuel standards in the European Union and U.S. can create a market for second-generation biofuels which use industrial gases such as oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen.\n\n## Costs Relating to the Protection of the Environment\n\nThe environmental protection costs incurred in 2024 were not significant. Linde anticipates that future annual environmental protection expenditures will be similar to 2024,  subject  to  any  significant  changes  in  ex isting  laws  and  regulations.  Based  on  historical  results  and  current  estimates,  management  does  not  believe  that environmental expenditures will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position, the consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given year.\n\n## Legal Proceedings\n\nSee Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements for information concerning legal proceedings.\n\n## Retirement Benefits\n\nPensions\n\nThe net periodic benefit cost (benefit) was a benefit of $106 million, $80 million and $110 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\nThe funded status (pension benefit obligation (\"PBO\") less the fair value of plan assets) for the U.S. plans was a surplus of $86 million and deficit of $137 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The funded status for non-U.S. plans was a surplus of $464 million and deficit of $207 million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. During 2024, the U.S. and non U.S plans derived a benefit from actuarial gains due to higher discount rate environment.\n\nGlobal pension contributions were $35 million in 2024, $46 million in 2023, and $51 million in 2022. At a minimum, Linde contributes to its pension plans to comply with local regulatory requirements (e.g., ERISA in the U.S.). Discretionary contributions in excess of the local minimum requirements are made based on many factors, including long-term projections of the plans' funded status, the economic environment, potential risk of overfunding, pension insurance costs and alternative uses of cash. Changes to these factors can impact the timing of discretionary contributions from year to year. Estimated required contributions for 2025 are currently expected to be in the range of $25 million to $35 million.\n\nLinde assumes expected returns on plan assets for 2025 of 7.00% and 6.02% for the U.S. and non-U.S. plans, respectively, which are consistent with the long-term expected returns on its investment portfolios.\n\nExcluding the impact of any settlements, 2025 consolidated pension expense is expected to be a benefit of approximately $145 million. The benefit derived from the expected return on assets assumption for Linde's most significant plans is anticipated to more than offset the expense from service and interest cost accruals and the higher amortization of deferred losses.\n\nRefer to the Critical Accounting Estimates section and Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements for a more detailed discussion of the company's retirement benefits, including a description of the various retirement plans and the assumptions used in the calculation of net periodic benefit cost (benefit) and funded status.\n\n## Insurance\n\nLinde  purchases  insurance  to  limit  a  variety  of  property  and  casualty  risks,  including  those  related  to  property,  business  interruption,  third-party  liability  and workers' compensation. Currently, the company self retains up to $10 million per occurrence for vehicle liability in the United States and $5 million per occurrence for workers' compensation and general liability. Through December 31, 2024, the company self retained risk up to \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million at its various properties worldwide for property damage resulting from fire, flood and other perils affecting its properties along with a separate \u20ac5 to \u20ac7.5 million deductible on business interruption resulting from a major peril loss. As of January 1, 2025 Linde has a captive insurance company that provides coverage for up to $50 million per event, and $100 million, in the annual aggregate, of losses above local deductibles for property damage and business interruption at the group's sites globally. To mitigate the risk of losses above these self retention levels, the company purchases catastrophic insurance coverage from highly rated insurance companies.",

      "answer": "LIN's Engineering Segment Sales declined significantly from $2.867B in 2022 to $2.160B in 2023, followed by an $162M (8%) rebound in 2024. This trajectory reveals a volatile segment with exposure to project timing and geopolitical factors, such as the wind down of sanctioned Russian projects, which impacted profitability negatively in 2024 despite the sales increase.",

      "answer": "Linde's financial exposure to supplementary retirement benefits increased steadily from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, the company had $47 million in unrecognized compensation costs related to performance-based awards and $31 million for restricted stock awards. By 2023, these figures rose to $48 million and $42 million, respectively. In 2024, the unrecognized compensation costs further increased to $62 million for performance-based awards and $50 million for restricted stock units, indicating a growing financial commitment to these unfunded, nonqualified retirement benefits for higher-level employees.",

The liability related to these grants reflects the current estimate of performance that will be achieved and the current share price.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, $47 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to performance-based awards and $31 million of unrecognized  compensation  cost  related  to  the  restricted  stock  awards  is  expected  to  be  recognized  primarily  through  the  first quarter of 2024.\n\n## NOTE 16. RETIREMENT PROGRAMS\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans - U.S.\n\nThe Linde retirement plans are non-contributory defined benefit plans covering eligible employees and its participating affiliates. Effective July 1, 2002, the Linde U.S. Pension Plan was amended to give participating employees a one-time irrevocable choice between  a  traditional  benefit  (the  'Traditional  Design')  and  an  account-based  benefit  (the  'Account-Based  Design').  The Traditional Design pays a monthly benefit based on years of service and average pay during the last years of the participant's career with Linde. The Account-Based Design gives participants annual pay credits equal to 4% of eligible compensation, plus interest credits based on long-term treasury rates on the accumulated account balance. This new formula applies to all new employees hired after  April  30,  2002  into  businesses  adopting  this  plan.  The  U.S.  pension  plan  assets  are  comprised  of  a  diversified  mix  of investments, including corporate equities, government securities and corporate debt securities. Linde has several plans that provide supplementary  retirement  benefits  primarily  to  higher  level  employees  that  are  unfunded  and  are  nonqualified  for  federal  tax purposes. Pension coverage for employees of certain of Linde's non-U.S. subsidiaries generally is provided by those companies through  separate  plans.  Obligations  under  such  plans  are  primarily  provided  for  through  diversified  investment  portfolios,  with some smaller plans provided for under insurance policies or by book reserves.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plans - Non-U.S.\n\nLinde has Non-U.S., defined benefit commitments primarily in Germany and the U.K that include pension plan assets comprised of a diversified mix of investments. The defined benefit commitments in Germany relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. These commitments also take into account vested rights for periods of service prior to January 1, 2002 based on earlier final-salary pension plan rules. In addition, there are direct commitments in respect of the salary conversion scheme for the form of cash balance plans. The resulting pension payments are calculated on the basis of an interest guarantee and the  performance  of  the  corresponding  investment.  There  are  no  minimum  funding  requirements.  The  pension  obligations  in Germany are partly funded by a Contractual Trust Agreement (CTA). Defined benefit commitments in the U.K. prior to July 1, 2003 are earnings-related and dependent on the period of service. Such commitments relate to old age pensions, invalidity pensions and surviving dependents pensions. Beginning in April 1, 2011, the amount of future increases in inflation-linked pensions and of increases in pensionable emoluments was restricted.\n\n## Multi-employer Pension Plans\n\nIn the United States Linde participates in eight multi-employer defined benefit pension plans (\"MEPs\"), pursuant to the terms of collective bargaining agreements, that cover approximately 200 union-represented employees.
