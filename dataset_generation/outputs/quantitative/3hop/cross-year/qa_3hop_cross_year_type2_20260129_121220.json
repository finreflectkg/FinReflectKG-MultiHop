      "answer": "In 2022, UNH reported $1.4 billion in other financing obligations, with $611 million classified as current. By 2023, total obligations decreased to $1.1 billion, with $188 million current. In 2024, total obligations further declined to $0.7 billion, with $197 million current. This shows a consistent reduction in both total and current obligations over the three-year period, suggesting a strategy of reducing short-term liabilities and possibly restructuring or paying down debt.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's deferred tax assets from Accrued Expenses and Allowances increased from $723 million in 2022 to $754 million in 2023, and then rose significantly to $1,055 million in 2024. This upward trend indicates a growing recognition of future tax benefits tied to accrued liabilities, suggesting a strategic shift or increased provisioning for expenses that will be deductible in future years. The sharp increase in 2024, compared to the more modest growth between 2022 and 2023, may reflect either a change in the timing of expense recognition or a material change in the company's tax planning assumptions.",

      "answer": "CVS's Other Comprehensive Loss Before Reclassifications showed significant volatility across the three years, reflecting instability in both pension obligations and investment performance. In 2022, the company reported a loss of $410 million before reclassifications, driven by a $2,556 million pretax loss in net unrealized investment gains (losses) and a $170 million pretax loss in pension and postretirement benefits. In 2023, the metric swung dramatically to a $603 million gain before reclassifications, fueled by a recovery in investment gains (from $(2,556) million to $603 million) and a smaller pension-related loss of $(170) million. However, in 2024, the metric deteriorated sharply to a $(170) million loss before reclassifications, with net unrealized investment gains (losses) plunging from $603 million to $(170) million and pension obligations worsening further with a $(53) million loss. This 3-year pattern reveals that CVS's financial position is highly sensitive to market fluctuations affecting both its investment portfolio and long-term pension liabilities.",

      "answer": "CVS's Pharmacy Claims and Discounts Payable increased from $19,423 million in 2022 to $22,874 million in 2023, and further to $24,166 million in 2024, indicating a consistent rise in the company's obligations related to pharmacy benefits. This upward trend reveals growing cost pressures in the pharmacy services segment, potentially driven by expanded prescription coverage, increased utilization, or broader network participation. The steady increase also suggests that CVS faced ongoing operational scaling challenges or strategic decisions to absorb higher pharmacy-related liabilities as part of its business model evolution.",

In applying this  model,  the  Company uses both historical data and current market data to estimate the fair value of its options. The BlackScholes model requires several assumptions including expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, volatility, and term of the options. The expected dividend yield is based on historical patterns of dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate at grant date of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Notes with a term equal to the expected term of the option. Expected volatility is estimated using a blend of historical and implied volatility. The historical component is based on historical monthly price changes. The implied volatility is obtained from market data on the Company's traded options. The expected life represents the amount of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, based on historical and forecasted exercise behavior.\n\nThe weighted average exercise price of options granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $75.99, $77.67 and $80.05 per option, respectively.

      "answer": "Merck's inventory-related deferred tax assets were $119 million in 2022, increased to $86 million in 2023 (despite a drop in liabilities from $423 million to $370 million), and remained relatively stable at $84 million in 2024. This slight decline over the three-year period suggests a consistent but modest tax asset position tied to inventory, potentially reflecting stable inventory valuation practices and modest changes in tax deductions related to inventory write-downs or cost capitalization.",

      "answer": "Prevymis sales grew significantly from 2022 to 2024, reflecting successful market expansion and increased demand. In 2022, sales were $428 million, driven by uptake in the U.S. and Europe and a new launch in China. In 2023, sales increased by 41% to $605 million, attributed to higher demand in the U.S. and Europe and the continued adoption of the China launch, along with a new FDA-approved indication for kidney transplant recipients. By 2024, sales reached $785 million, indicating sustained growth and consolidation in previously expanded markets. This trajectory suggests a successful global commercialization strategy and increasing clinical adoption of Prevymis in transplant medicine.",

The patent that provided market exclusivity  for Noxafil in  a  number  of  major  European  markets  expired  in  December  2019.  As  a  result,  the  Company  is experiencing lower demand for Noxafil in  these  markets due to generic competition and expects the decline to continue. Global sales of Noxafil declined 50% in 2020 due to generic competition in the U.S. and in Europe. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for certain forms of Noxafil representing the majority of U.S. Noxafil sales expired in July 2019.\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  Company  temporarily  suspended  sales  of Zerbaxa ,  a  combination  antibacterial  and  betalactamase  inhibitor  for  the  treatment  of  certain  bacterial  infections,  and  subsequently  issued  a  product  recall,  following  the identification of product sterility issues. As a result, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge in 2020 related to Zerbaxa (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021, which the Company expects to continue during 2022.\n\n## Immunology\n\n",

In fiscal year 2024, MDT recorded a tax benefit of $3 million. This indicates that performance share units only began to vest in 2024, suggesting a delayed vesting schedule for these equity instruments.

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Medtronic reported no fair value for performance share units vested. In fiscal year 2023, the company reported a fair value of $78 million for vested performance share units, and this same amount was carried forward into fiscal year 2024. This indicates that the company began recognizing financial obligations tied to performance-based equity compensation starting in fiscal year 2023, suggesting a shift or activation in compensation structures that align executive rewards with performance metrics over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the resolution and expiration of statutes of limitation of uncertain tax positions reduced DHR's effective tax rate by 0.3%. By 2023, this impact slightly decreased to a 0.4% reduction, and in 2024, it remained relatively stable at a 0.6% reduction. This indicates a consistent decline in the negative impact of uncertain tax positions over time, suggesting improved resolution of prior-year uncertainties and potentially stronger tax risk management. The trend reveals that DHR has been gradually reducing its exposure to uncertain tax positions, contributing to a more stable effective tax rate trajectory across the three-year period.",

      "answer": "Danaher's effective tax rate decreased significantly in 2022 to 11.4%, driven by legal and operational realignments, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, and the release of uncertain tax position reserves. In 2023, the rate rose slightly to 16.3%, influenced by similar benefits but offset by tax costs from the Separation and business realignment actions. In 2024, the rate settled at 16.3% again, with discrete benefits from tax incentives and stock-based compensation, but impacted by intangible asset impairments in high-tax jurisdictions. The 3-year trend shows volatility, shaped by strategic restructuring and discrete tax events.",

These items decreased the reported rate on a net basis by 3.5%.\n- The effective tax rate of 18.9% in 2020 includes net tax benefits primarily related to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by a higher tax rate associated with the gain on the divestiture of certain product lines in the Life Sciences segment and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. These items decreased the reported rate on a net basis by 0.7%.\n- The effective tax rate of 26.4% in 2019 includes 650 basis points of tax charges related primarily to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions, audit settlements, and Envista Disposition costs, net of the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation, release of valuation allowances associated with certain non-U.S. tax credits, tax benefits resulting from changes in tax law and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\n\nThe Company made income tax payments related to both continuing and discontinued operations of approximately $1.7 billion, $1.1 billion and $847 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Current income taxes payable related to both continuing and discontinued operations has been reduced by $118 million, $110 million and $79 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for tax deductions attributable to stock-based compensation, of which, the excess tax benefit over the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes for both continuing and discontinued operations was $95 million, $85 million and $55 million, respectively. The excess tax benefits have been recorded as reductions to the current income tax provision and are reflected as operating cash inflows in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIncluded in deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2021 are tax benefits for U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards totaling $427 million ($172 million of which the Company does not expect to realize and have corresponding valuation allowances). Certain of the losses can be carried forward indefinitely and others can be carried forward to various dates from 2022 through 2041. In addition, the Company had general business and non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $117 million ($58 million of which the Company does not expect to realize and have corresponding valuation allowances) as of December 31, 2021, which can be carried forward to various dates from 2022 to 2031.

For each period presented, the effectiv e tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% principally due to the impact of the Company's global operations, research tax credits, foreign-deriv ed intangible income and aggregate net discrete benefits or charges.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the effectiv e tax rate included the tax effect from intangible asset impairments in a jurisdiction with a higher statutory tax rate than the Company's effectiv e tax rate and discrete tax benefits from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, the release of reserv es for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and changes in estimates related to prior year tax filing positions, net of charges related to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Danaher Corporation's change in noncontrolling interests showed a distinct pattern: in 2022, the change was -$1 million, indicating a slight reduction in noncontrolling interests; in 2023, the change was -$2 million, showing a more pronounced decline; and in 2024, the change was +$3 million, reflecting a reversal and a significant increase in noncontrolling interests. This volatile trajectory suggests that Danaher actively managed its minority stake positions during this period, initially reducing exposure, but later increasing involvement in entities with noncontrolling interests, possibly aligning with broader strategic realignments such as the distribution of Veralto Corporation in 2023 and 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [DHR](2022) \u2192 [Change in Noncontrolling Interests]: In 2022, the change in noncontrolling interests was -$1 million, indicating a minor reduction.",
        "Hop 2: [DHR](2023) \u2192 [Change in Noncontrolling Interests]: In 2023, the change was -$2 million, showing a more significant decrease, consistent with divestiture or restructuring activities.",
        "Hop 3: [DHR](2024) \u2192 [Change in Noncontrolling Interests]: In 2024, the change was +$3 million, reflecting a reversal and an increase in noncontrolling interests, suggesting renewed investment or acquisition activity."

On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , using the modified retrospective transition method and recorded a net increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts of $10 million due to the cumulative impact of adoption. The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2021 reflects the Company's best estimate of the expected future losses for its accounts receivables; however, these estimates may change and future actual losses may differ from the Company's estimates. The Company will continue to monitor economic conditions and will revise the estimates of the expected future losses for accounts receivable as necessary. The Company recorded $31 million, $31 million and $30 million of expense associated with doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nIncluded in the Company's trade accounts receivable and other long-term assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are $247 million and $254 million of net aggregate financing receivables, respectively. All financing receivables are evaluated for impairment based on individual customer credit profiles.\n\nInventories-Inventories include the costs of material, labor and overhead.

      "answer": "ABT's revenue from Rapid Diagnostics declined significantly over the three-year period\u2014from $8,553 million in 2022 to $3,690 million in 2023, and further down to $2,997 million in 2024. This represents a 56.9% drop from 2022 to 2023 and an additional 18.8% decline from 2023 to 2024. The consistent downward trend indicates a major contraction in this segment, which contrasts sharply with growth in other diagnostic categories like Core Laboratory and Point of Care. This trajectory suggests a potential strategic repositioning or market shift away from Rapid Diagnostics, or possibly a response to reduced demand post-pandemic, which had previously driven high growth in 2022.",

      "question": "How has Abbott's investment in the Nutritional Products segment evolved from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year trend reveal about its strategic focus on this business area?",
      "answer": "Abbott's investment in the Nutritional Products segment remained relatively stable from 2022 to 2023, with goodwill allocations of $286 million in 2022 and $285 million in 2023. However, in 2024, the company emphasized competitive positioning and innovation within this segment, highlighting ingredient innovation and new product introductions as key strategic levers. While the Nutritional Products segment did not see a direct increase in goodwill during this period, the operational focus in 2024 indicates a renewed strategic emphasis on competing with diversified consumer and healthcare manufacturers through innovation and product differentiation. This suggests that Abbott is maintaining a stable financial stake in the segment while pivoting toward enhancing its market competitiveness through R&D and marketing efforts.",

Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure.\n\n## Medical Devices\n\nThese  products  include  a  broad  line  of  rhythm  management,  electrophysiology,  heart  failure,  vascular  and  structural  heart  devices  for  the  treatment  of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care and continuous glucose monitoring products, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders.  Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide.  In the  United  States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians' offices, consumers, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.\n\nThe principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are:\n\n- rhythm management products, including Assurity MRI and Endurity MRI pacemaker systems, and Aveir single-chamber (VR and AR) and Aveir dual chamber (DR) leadless pacemaker systems; Ellipse , Fortify Assura ,  and G allant implantable cardioverter defibrillators and G allant and Quadra Assura MP  implantable cardioverter  defibrillator  with  cardiac  resynchronization  therapy  and  MultiPoint\u2122  Pacing  technology;  and  Confirm  Rx ,  Jot  Dx and ASSERT-IQ  implantable cardiac monitors; \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- electrophysiology products, including the TactiFlex  and TactiCath families of ablation catheters, and FlexAbility irrigated ablation catheters; EnSite family of cardiac mapping systems; Agilis NxT  and  Swartz\u2122  introducer  catheters;  the Advisor HD  G rid  mapping  catheter;  and  V iewFlex family  of intracardiac echocardiography catheters; \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- heart failure related products, including the HeartMate left ventricular assist device family; the CardioMEMS HF System pulmonary artery sensor, a heart failure monitoring system; the CentriMag System, an acute mechanical circulatory support system; and patient self-testing products and services; \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- vascular products, including the XIENCE  family of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link V ision platform;  StarClose  SE , Perclose ProGlide and Perclose ProStyle vessel closure devices, TREK coronary balloon dilatation products, Hi-Torque Balance Middleweight Universal II guidewires, Supera Peripheral  Stent  System,  a  peripheral  vascular  stent  system; Acculink /Accunet and  Xact /Emboshield NAV6 ,  carotid  stent systems; the OPTIS integrated systems with Ultreon 1.0 and 2.0 Software, compatible with the Dragonfly OPTIS and OpStar imaging catheters and PressureWire fractional flow reserve measurement systems; Diamondback 360 coronary and peripheral orbital atherectomy systems; and Esprit\u2122 BTK everolimus eluting resorbable scaffold system; \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- structural heart products, including MitraClip , a mitral valve transcatheter edge-to-edge repair system; TriClip , a tricuspid valve transcatheter edge-toedge repair system; Epic , a surgical family of aortic valve and mitral valve replacement devices; Portico and Navitor transcatheter aortic heart valves; Regent\u2122 and Masters Series mechanical heart valves; Amplatzer PFO occluders; Amplatzer Amulet occluder devices; and the Tendyne transcatheter mitral valve replacement system; \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- continuous glucose and blood glucose monitoring systems under the  FreeStyle brand  such  as  the  FreeStyle  Libre system,  including  sensors,  data management decision software, test strips, and accessories for people with diabetes; and the Lingo continuous glucose monitoring system, including sensors and data management decision software for people's health and wellness; and \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- neuromodulation  products,  including  spinal  cord  stimulators  Proclaim Plus  and  Proclaim XR  recharge-free  implantable  pulse  generators  (IPG )  and rechargeable Eterna IPG, each with BurstDR stimulation, and Proclaim DRG IPG, a neurostimulation device designed for dorsal root ganglion therapy, for the treatment of chronic pain disorders; and the non-rechargeable Infinity\u2122 deep brain stimulation (DBS) system and the rechargeable Liberta RC\u2122 DBS system, each with directional lead technology for the treatment of movement disorders. \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae",

Net actuarial losses and prior service cost is included as a component of net periodic benefit cost - see Note 13 for additional information.\n\n## Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nThe total amount of goodwill reported was $23.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and $23.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by $532 million in 2021 and increased goodwill by $550 million in 2020. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2021 was $2.8 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $3.7 billion for the  Diagnostic  Products  segment,  and  $16.4  billion  for  the  Medical  Devices  segment.  There  were  no  reductions  of goodwill relating to impairments in 2021 and 2020.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&amp;D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $919  million  and  $1.2  billion  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  The  decrease  is  due  to  IPR&amp;D  assets primarily related to the Medical Devices segment that became amortizable in 2021, partially offset by an increase of approximately $80 million related to a recent acquisition. In 2020, a $55 million impairment of an IPR&amp;D intangible asset  related  to  the  Medical  Devices  segment  was  recorded  in  the  Research  and  development  line  of  Abbott's Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nThe gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $27.7 billion and $27.8 billion  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  and  accumulated  amortization  was  $15.9  billion  and $14.2 billion as of December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  Amortizable intangible assets increased  by approximately $120 million as a result of a recent acquisition and the additional assets are being amortized over 9 years. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $197 million in 2021 and increased intangible assets by $67 million in 2020. In 2021, asset impairments related to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment decreased  intangible  assets  by  $14  million.  In  2020,  asset  impairments  related  to  the  Medical  Devices  segment decreased intangible assets by $148 million. The impairments were recorded in the Cost of products sold, excluding amortization  of  intangible  assets  line  of  Abbott's  Consolidated  Statement  of  Earnings.  The  estimated  annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2021 is approximately $2.1 billion in 2022, $2.0 billion in 2023, $1.9 billion in 2024, $1.7 billion in 2025 and $1.6 billion in 2026. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years.",

Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include  amounts  for  sales  rebates,  income  tax es,  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefits,  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  litigation,  derivative  financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nREVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer's normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain Abbott businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation.\n\nINCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GIL TI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings.\n\nEARNINGS PER SHARE - Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $13.351 billion, $5.701 billion and $6.905 billion, respectively.\n\nPENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS - Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five-year period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method.",

No  additional  income  taxes  have  been  provided  for  any  remaining  undistributed  foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations.

Earnings  from  Continuing  Operations  allocated  to  common  shares  in  2021,  2020  and  2019  were  $7.042 billion,  $4.449  billion  and  $3.666  billion,  respectively.

          "chunk_text": "Competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail  distribution,  and  availability  of  product  forms. A  significant  aspect  of  competition  is  the  search  for  ingredient innovations.  The  introduction  of  new  products  by  competitors,  changes  in  medical  practices  and  procedures,  and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure.\n\n## Medical Devices\n\nThese  products  include  a  broad  line  of  rhythm  management,  electrophysiology,  heart  failure,  vascular  and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally  marketed  and  sold  directly  to  wholesalers,  hospitals,  ambulatory  surgery  centers,  physicians'  offices,  and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses. Outside the United States, sales are made either directly to customers or through distributors, depending on the market served.\n\nThe principal products included in the Medical Devices segment are:\n\n- rhythm management products, including Assurity MRI \u00ae   and  Endurity  MRI \u00ae   pacemaker  systems;  Ellipse \u00ae , Fortify Assura \u00ae ,  and  Gallant\u2122 implantable cardioverter defibrillators and Gallant and Quadra Assura MP \u00ae implantable cardioverter defibrillator with cardiac resynchronization therapy and MultiPoint \u00ae   Pacing technology; and Confirm Rx \u00ae  and Jot Dx\u2122 implantable cardiac monitors;\n- electrophysiology products, including the TactiCath \u00ae  family of ablation catheters and FlexAbility \u00ae  irrigated ablation catheters; Ampere \u00ae  RF ablation generator; EnSite \u00ae  family of cardiac mapping systems; Agilis\u2122 NxT Steerable Introducer; the Advisor \u00ae HD  Grid mapping catheter;  ViewFlex\u2122  family of intracardiac echocardiography catheters; and ViewMate\u2122 Ultrasound System;\n- heart failure related products, including the HeartMate \u00ae  left ventricular device family, the CardioMEMS \u00ae  HF System  pulmonary  artery  sensor,  a  heart  failure  monitoring  system,  and  the  CentriMag \u00ae   System,  an  acute circulatory support system;\n- vascular products, including the XIENCE \u00ae  family of drug-eluting coronary stent systems developed on the Multi-Link  Vision \u00ae   platform;  StarClose  SE \u00ae ,  Perclose  ProGlide \u00ae   and  Perclose  ProStyle \u00ae   vessel  closure devices,  TREK \u00ae   coronary  balloon  dilatation  products,  Hi-Torque  Balance  Middleweight  Universal  II \u00ae guidewires,  Supera \u00ae   Peripheral  Stent  System,  a  peripheral  vascular  stent  system; Acculink \u00ae /Accunet \u00ae   and Xact \u00ae /Emboshield  NAV6 \u00ae ,  carotid  stent  systems;  the  OPTIS \u00ae   integrated  systems  with  Ultreon\u2122  1.0 Software, compatible with the Dragonfly OPTIS \u00ae  imaging catheter and PressureWire \u00ae  fractional flow reserve measurement systems; and the JETi\u2122 peripheral thrombectomy systems for clot removal;\n- structural  heart  products,  including  MitraClip \u00ae ,  a  transcatheter  mitral  valve  repair  system;  Trifecta \u00ae   Valve with  Glide\u2122  Technology,  a  surgical  tissue  heart  valve;  Portico \u00ae   and  Navitor\u2122  transcatheter  aortic  heart valves; Regent\u2122 mechanical heart valves; Amplatzer \u00ae  PFO occluders; Amplatzer Amulet \u00ae  occluder devices; the  Tendyne \u00ae   Transcatheter  Mitral  Valve  Implantation  (TMVI)  system;  and  the  TriClip \u00ae   Transcatheter Tricuspid Valve Repair System;\n- continuous  glucose  and  blood  glucose  monitoring  systems,  including  test  strips,  sensors,  data  management decision software, and accessories for people with diabetes, under the FreeStyle \u00ae  brand such as the FreeStyle Libre \u00ae  system; and\n- neuromodulation products, including spinal  cord  stimulators  Proclaim \u00ae   Elite  and  Proclaim \u00ae   XR  Rechargefree  implantable  pulse  generators  (IPG)  and  Prodigy  MRI \u00ae   IPG,  each  with  BurstDR \u00ae   stimulation,  and Proclaim \u00ae  DRG IPG, a neurostimulation device designed for dorsal root ganglion therapy, for the treatment of chronic pain disorders; and the Infinity \u00ae  Deep Brain Stimulation System with directional lead technology for the treatment of movement disorders.\n\nThese products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, product performance, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. Although Abbott has benefited  from  technological  advantages  of  certain  of  its  current  products,  these  advantages  may  be  reduced  or eliminated as competitors introduce new products.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Rapid Diagnostics generated $4,376 million in revenue, showing a 113% increase driven largely by pandemic-related demand for diagnostic tests, including $8.4 billion in COVID-19 testing sales. By 2023, total Rapid Diagnostics revenue dropped significantly to $3,690 million, reflecting the broader decline in pandemic-driven demand, with $1.6 billion attributed to COVID-19 testing. In 2024, the business saw further decline in its pandemic-related revenue to $747 million, and strategic shifts were evident as the Acelis Connected Health business was transferred out of Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure in January 2023, removing an additional $115 million in 2022 sales from the segment. This three-year trajectory indicates a strategic repositioning and normalization of the diagnostics business post-pandemic.",

      "answer": "Amgen's accrued sales deductions increased steadily from $5.2 billion in 2022 to $7.3 billion in 2023, and further to $8.4 billion in 2024. This consistent upward trend indicates a growing financial exposure to rebate and discount obligations, particularly for U.S. product sales, including chargebacks, commercial rebates, and Medicaid rebates. The increasing accruals suggest either higher sales volumes subject to deductions or more complex contractual and regulatory environments requiring larger reserves. The company also emphasized ongoing audit scrutiny and forecasting controls to manage these material accruals.",

          "chunk_text": "| Description of the Matter                | As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded accrued sales deductions of $5.2 billion. As described in Note 1 to the financial statements under the caption 'Product sales and sales deductions,' revenues from product sales are recognized net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively sales deductions), which are established at the time of sale. Auditing the estimation of sales deductions, which are netted against product sales, is complex, requires significant judgment, and the amounts involved are material to the financial statements taken as a whole. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, and is based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, which represents an amount that is net of accruals for estimated sales deductions. The estimated sales deductions are based on current contractual and statutory requirements, market events and trends, internal and external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes. This included testing controls over management's review of significant assumptions and inputs used in the estimate of sales deductions, including actual sales, contractual terms, historical experience, wholesaler inventory levels, demand data and estimated patient population. We also tested management's controls over the accuracy of forecasting demand activity as well as the completeness and accuracy of the significant components included in the final sales deduction estimates. To test management's estimated sales deductions, we obtained management's calculations for the respective estimates and performed the following procedures, among others. We tested management's estimation process over the determination of sales discount accruals by developing an independent expectation of the estimated accrual balances, including comparing accrual balances recorded by management to those implied by historical payment trends, performing a lookback analysis using actual historical data to evaluate the forecasted amounts, assessing subsequent events to determine whether there was any new information that would require adjustment to the initial accruals, evaluating trends in actual sales and discount accrual |",

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements under the caption 'Product sales and sales deductions,' revenues from product sales are recognized net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively sales deductions), which are established at the time of sale. Auditing the estimation of sales deductions, specifically estimated chargebacks, commercial rebates, and Medicaid rebates related to U.S. product sales, which are netted against product sales, is complex, requires significant judgment, and the amounts involved are material to the financial statements taken as a whole. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, and is based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, which represents an amount that is net of accruals for estimated sales deductions. The estimated sales deductions are based on current contractual and statutory requirements, market events and trends, internal and external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns.   |\n|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes.

      "answer": "In 2022, Amgen reported R&D technology rights with a gross carrying amount of $1,377 million and accumulated amortization of $1,133 million, resulting in a net value of $244 million. By 2023, Amgen explicitly linked R&D technology rights to acquisitions, specifically citing the inclusion of assets from the Teneobio acquisition, indicating a strategic emphasis on acquiring external R&D platforms. In 2024, the gross carrying amount of R&D technology rights remained stable at $1,374 million, but accumulated amortization increased to $1,235 million, reducing the net value to $139 million. This reflects a consistent investment in R&D technology rights since 2022, with a growing amortization burden over time, suggesting maturation or integration of acquired technologies into Amgen's portfolio.",

      "answer": "Amgen's investment in R&D Technology Rights began in 2022 with the Teneobio acquisition, which included $94 million in R&D technology rights. By 2023, this value increased to $115 million as part of the post-acquisition valuation, reflecting deeper integration of Teneobio's bispecific and multispecific antibody technologies. In 2024, Amgen still held these R&D technology rights, but the earlier termination of AMG 340 (Teneobio\u2019s leading asset) in Q3 2023 likely impacted the long-term value and strategic outlook of the platform.

Licensing  rights consists  primarily  of  contractual  rights  acquired  in  acquisitions  to  receive  future  milestone,  royalty  and  profit-sharing  payments; capitalized payments to third parties for milestones related to regulatory approvals to commercialize products; and up-front payments associated with royalty obligations for marketed products. Marketing-related rights consists primarily of rights related to the sale and distribution of marketed products. R&amp;D technology rights pertains to technologies used in R&amp;D that have alternative future uses.\n\nIPR&amp;D consists  of  R&amp;D  projects  acquired  in  a  business  combination  that  are  not  complete  at  the  time  of  acquisition  due  to remaining  technological  risks  and/or  lack  of  receipt  of  required  regulatory  approvals.  All  IPR&amp;D  projects  have  major  risks  and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the development and commercialization of product candidates, including  our  ability  to  confirm  safety  and  efficacy  based  on  data  from  clinical  trials,  our  ability  to  obtain  necessary  regulatory approvals  and  our  ability  to  successfully  complete  these  tasks  within  budgeted  costs.  We  are  not  permitted  to  market  a  human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require the completion of clinical trials that demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective. In addition, the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans as well as competitive product launches, affect the revenues a product can generate. Consequently, the eventual realized values, if any, of acquired IPR&amp;D projects may vary from their estimated fair values. We review IPR&amp;D projects for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable and upon the establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired certain finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the Teneobio acquisition, including IPR&amp;D of $1.1 billion, R&amp;D technology rights of $94 million and licensing rights of $41 million. See Note 2, Acquisitions.\n\nDuring  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  we  recognized  amortization  associated  with  our  finite-lived intangible assets of $2.6 billion, $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets is included primarily in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total estimated amortization for our finite-lived intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, are $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.",

      "answer": "CVS's 'Other Comprehensive Loss Before Reclassifications' showed significant fluctuation from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, it was $(2,556) million, indicating a substantial loss. In 2023, the loss improved to $603 million, suggesting a partial recovery. However, in 2024, the metric turned negative again with a loss of $(170) million. This volatility was driven by swings in unrealized investment gains and pension-related adjustments, which moved from $(170) million in 2022 to $(61) million in 2023 and then to $53 million in 2024. The pattern reveals instability in long-duration insurance reserves and pension liabilities, which had wide swings in comprehensive income contributions across the years.",

      "answer": "CVS's Pharmacy Claims and Discounts Payable liability increased consistently from $17,330 million in 2022 to $19,423 million in 2023, and further to $24,166 million in 2024. This upward trajectory indicates a growing volume of pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business, with increasing obligations to process and pay pharmacy claims and discounts. The 39% increase over the three-year period aligns with CVS's strategic expansion in PBM services and suggests rising demand for its pharmacy network and prescription benefit solutions.",

      "answer": "CVS's liabilities for IBNR plus expected development on reported claims increased steadily from $6.6 billion in 2022 to $8.7 billion in 2023, and further to $11.3 billion in 2024. This represents a 40.3% increase from 2022 to 2023 and a 29.9% increase from 2023 to 2024. The trend indicates a growing exposure to healthcare claims risk, particularly in the current calendar year, suggesting either expanding healthcare obligations or a more conservative actuarial estimation approach by the company.",

In 2022, the company disclosed incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2021, net of reinsurance, and included total IBNR liabilities and expected development on reported claims within net incurred claims. In 2023, this disclosure was updated to cover the year ended December 31, 2022, maintaining the same estimation methodology. By 2024, the company again reaffirmed the same approach for the year ended December 31, 2023, indicating no changes in methodology over the three-year period. The consistency in methodology suggests that the company did not adjust its actuarial assumptions despite evolving health care cost environments, which could imply either confidence in the existing model or constraints in system adaptability.",

      "question": "How did Pfizer's Adjusted Cost of Sales definition and its relevance to business performance evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of exclusions related to purchase accounting for acquisitions and amortization of intangible assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer defined Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. By 2023, the exclusions remained largely consistent but were rephrased to emphasize exclusions related to amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related items. In 2024, the definition shifted further to focus specifically on the impact of amortization of intangible assets, certain acquisition-related items, and discontinued operations, signaling a narrowing of excluded components and a more standardized approach to performance reporting. This evolution suggests a strategic effort to normalize financial performance for investors by reducing the impact of non-recurring or non-operational factors over time.",

        "Hop 1: [PFE](2022) \u2192 [Adjusted Cost of Sales]: Defined as cost of sales before purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and significant items, used to evaluate recurring operations and assist in forecasting.",
        "Hop 2: [PFE](2023) \u2192 [Adjusted Cost of Sales]: Definition remained similar but emphasized exclusions related to amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related items, with a consistent focus on normalized performance and operational management.",
        "Hop 3: [PFE](2024) \u2192 [Adjusted Cost of Sales]: Definition narrowed to focus on amortization of intangible assets and certain acquisition-related items, continuing the emphasis on normalized performance and investor clarity in forecasting and evaluation."

      "question": "How did Pfizer's gross unrecognized tax benefits evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's tax position stability and audit risk exposure over time?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's gross unrecognized tax benefits decreased from $6.1 billion in 2022 to $4.8 billion in 2023, and further declined to $4.5 billion in 2024. This consistent downward trend indicates that the company either settled certain uncertain tax positions during audits or revised its estimates as audit outcomes became clearer. The reduction suggests improving tax position stability and potentially lower audit risk exposure over the three-year period, as fewer uncertain tax benefits remained unresolved.",

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Pfizer Inc.:\n\n## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1C to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for pension and postretirement plans in 2021 to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nEvaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual\n\nAs discussed in Note 1H to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performancebased contract rebates (collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the same period that the corresponding revenues are recognized. The length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant management judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involved especially challenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Company's revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the U.S. rebates accrual using internal information and historical data and compared the result to the Company's estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Company's ability to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S. rebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.\n\n## Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\n\nAs discussed in Notes 5D and 1 Q , the Company's tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the Company's tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $6.1 billion.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n49",

As of D ecem ber 31, 2024, the C om pany has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $4.5 billion.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the C om pany's gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit m atter because a high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and com plex auditor judgm ent was required in evaluating the C om pany's interpretation of tax law and its estim ate of the ultim ate resolution of its tax positions.\n\nThe following are the prim ary procedures we perform ed to address this critical audit m atter. W e evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control over the C om pany's liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the C om pany's tax positions m ay not be sustained upon audit, and (3) estim ation and recording of the gross\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n49",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Pfizer consistently excluded gains and losses on equity securities and pension-related remeasurements from Adjusted income, citing their inherent market volatility and lack of relevance to core operations. In 2022, the company emphasized that these items were excluded because they were unpredictable and not reflective of ongoing business performance. By 2023, Pfizer reinforced this rationale while also noting that such exclusions were part of a broader category of 'Certain Significant Items' that were evaluated both quantitatively and qualitatively. In 2024, the company maintained the same exclusions but expanded the framing to include a discussion of how these adjustments align with management\u2019s internal performance assessment and investor understanding. This consistent exclusion across three years indicates Pfizer's strategic effort to present a normalized view of performance by filtering out financial noise from non-core activities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Purchase Accounting Adjustments\n\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. Therefore, the Adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.\n\nThe exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&amp;D costs have been expensed. However, we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, such as different R&amp;D costs, timelines or resulting sales; accordingly, this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets internally.\n\n## Acquisition-Related Items\n\nAdjusted income excludes acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.\n\nThe significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nAdjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\n\n## Certain Significant Items\n\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. Gains and losses on equity securities have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information--Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items.\n\nBeginning in 2021, we exclude pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses from our measure of Adjusted income because of their inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n42",

      "answer": "Danaher's effective tax rate fluctuated across the three-year period: it was 11.4% in 2022, decreased further to 16.3% in 2023, and then included a 1.4% net reduction from discrete items in 2024. In 2022, discrete tax benefits, including those from business realignments and stock-based compensation, reduced the rate by 7.0%. In 2023, similar discrete items reduced the rate by only 0.9%, indicating a much smaller impact. In 2024, the effective tax rate was influenced by impairments in high-tax jurisdictions and again saw discrete benefits, this time reducing the rate by 1.4%. This evolution shows a shift from significant strategic tax benefits in 2022 to a more stable and less aggressively optimized tax profile in 2023 and 2024, suggesting a consolidation phase in the company's global tax strategy.",

For each period presented, the effectiv e tax rate differs from the U.S. federal statutory rate of 21.0% principally due to the impact of the Company's global operations, research tax credits, foreign-deriv ed intangible income and aggregate net discrete benefits or charges.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2024, the effectiv e tax rate included the tax effect from intangible asset impairments in a jurisdiction with a higher statutory tax rate than the Company's effectiv e tax rate and discrete tax benefits from excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, the release of reserv es for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation and changes in estimates related to prior year tax filing positions, net of charges related to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions.

The non-U.S. countries in which the Company has a significant presence include China, Denmark, Germany, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom.

These items decreased the reported rate on a net basis by 3.5%.\n- The effective tax rate of 18.9% in 2020 includes net tax benefits primarily related to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by a higher tax rate associated with the gain on the divestiture of certain product lines in the Life Sciences segment and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. These items decreased the reported rate on a net basis by 0.7%.\n- The effective tax rate of 26.4% in 2019 includes 650 basis points of tax charges related primarily to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions, audit settlements, and Envista Disposition costs, net of the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation, release of valuation allowances associated with certain non-U.S. tax credits, tax benefits resulting from changes in tax law and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\n\nThe Company made income tax payments related to both continuing and discontinued operations of approximately $1.7 billion, $1.1 billion and $847 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Current income taxes payable related to both continuing and discontinued operations has been reduced by $118 million, $110 million and $79 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for tax deductions attributable to stock-based compensation, of which, the excess tax benefit over the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes for both continuing and discontinued operations was $95 million, $85 million and $55 million, respectively. The excess tax benefits have been recorded as reductions to the current income tax provision and are reflected as operating cash inflows in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIncluded in deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2021 are tax benefits for U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards totaling $427 million ($172 million of which the Company does not expect to realize and have corresponding valuation allowances).

      "question": "How did Gilead's AmBisome sales evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the geographic demand dynamics for the product over time?",
      "answer": "AmBisome sales were $540 million in 2022, declined slightly to $497 million in 2023, and then increased to $533 million in 2024. The geographic breakdown shows that U.S. sales declined consistently from $39 million in 2022 to $43 million in 2023 and then to $44 million in 2024, while international markets, particularly Europe and the Rest of World, remained relatively stable or slightly increased. This suggests that demand outside the U.S. helped sustain AmBisome sales despite domestic declines.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

      "question": "How did Gilead's reliance on HIV product sales evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend reveal about the company's exposure to competitive and paradigm shift risks in the HIV treatment market?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Gilead's total HIV product sales amounted to $16.315 billion, representing a 4% decline from the prior year, driven by declines in older products like Descovy and Truvada-based regimens. In 2023, the company disclosed that HIV product sales accounted for approximately 67% of total product sales, signaling a continued heavy reliance on this therapeutic area despite declining growth trends. By 2024, Gilead reiterated the risk of market share erosion due to competitive products and potential shifts in the HIV treatment paradigm, particularly around nucleoside-based therapies like TAF, which underpin many of its HIV products. This 3-year trend shows a persistent but declining revenue base from HIV products, with increasing emphasis on the strategic risk of overreliance on a shrinking core franchise.",

A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could,  in  circumstances  we  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict,  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operations,  growth,  reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "question": "How did Biktarvy's global sales revenue evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about Gilead's position in the HIV treatment market?",
      "answer": "Biktarvy's global sales revenue increased from $11.85 billion in 2022 to $13.42 billion in 2024, representing a steady growth trajectory. In 2022, Biktarvy was already the largest contributor to Gilead\u2019s HIV segment, and its dominance continued to expand in 2023 and 2024. This consistent growth suggests that Biktarvy has become a cornerstone of Gilead\u2019s HIV portfolio, compensating for declines in other products like Truvada and reinforcing Gilead\u2019s leadership in the HIV treatment market.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group's total Other Financing Obligations decreased from $1.4 billion in 2022 to $1.1 billion in 2023, and then dropped further to $0.7 billion in 2024. Meanwhile, the current portion of these obligations fluctuated: it was $611 million in 2022, declined sharply to $188 million in 2023, and then slightly increased to $197 million in 2024. This downward trend in total obligations combined with a relatively stable current portion in the last two years suggests a deliberate strategy to reduce long-term financing liabilities while managing short-term obligations within a consistent range.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's nondeductible liabilities increased from $296 million in 2022 to $329 million in 2023, and further to $343 million in 2024. This steady upward trend indicates a consistent growth in tax-related obligations that cannot be offset against taxable income, suggesting either increasing non-deductible expenses or strategic tax planning decisions that preserved certain liabilities. The year-over-year growth\u2014$33 million from 2022 to 2023 and $14 million from 2023 to 2024\u2014shows a deliberate trajectory rather than volatility, implying a long-term tax positioning strategy by the company.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's deferred income tax asset for Accrued Expenses and Allowances increased from $723 million in 2022 to $754 million in 2023, and then significantly rose to $1,055 million in 2024. This represents a 46% increase over the three-year period, with the most notable jump occurring between 2023 and 2024. The upward trend suggests a growing deferral of tax liabilities tied to accrued expenses, potentially reflecting either increased expense accruals or changes in tax treatment of these items over time.",

By 2023, IPRD included a $2.8 billion allocation previously assigned to repotrectinib, which was later transferred to marketed product rights after FDA approval. In 2024, BMY's acquired IPRD spending surged to $13.373 billion, showing a strategic emphasis on acquiring and advancing high-potential investigational assets.

In 2022, BMY recognized $522 million in tax benefits related to statute lapses and effectively settled contingent tax matters.

By 2024, a substantial $644 million benefit was recorded, primarily tied to the resolution of Celgene's 2017\u20132019 IRS audit. This pattern reveals a strategic and progressive resolution of contingent tax matters, especially those inherited from the Celgene acquisition, with a notable acceleration in 2024.

The excise tax was recognized in Cost of products sold when the intra-entity sale occurred. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax was not deductible but resulted in foreign tax credits that were generally recognized in BMS's provision for income taxes when the excise tax was incurred. As of December 31, 2022, BMS amended its existing Puerto Rico decree, eliminating the excise tax and increasing its Puerto Rico tax rate to 10.5% effective for the tax year beginning January 1, 2023, and extending BMS's tax grants an additional 15 years to 2038.",

      "answer": "BMY's Alliance and Other Revenues showed a fluctuating pattern across the three years: in 2022, the revenue stood at $1,488 million, which decreased to $1,228 million in 2023, and then increased to $1,522 million in 2024. This trajectory reveals a volatile trend in the company's strategic partnership revenues, with a notable dip in 2023 followed by a rebound in 2024. The fluctuation suggests shifting dynamics in BMY's external collaborations, potentially reflecting changes in partnership structures, performance-based revenue adjustments, or evolving market conditions affecting alliance-driven income.",

      "question": "How did the trajectory of Bristol-Myers Squibb's increase to net earnings evolve from 2022 ($10,206M) to 2023 ($7,573M) and then to 2024 ($11,288M), and what does this pattern suggest about the company's financial volatility and strategic adjustments over the three-year period?",
      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb's increase to net earnings started at $10,206 million in 2022, declined to $7,573 million in 2023, and then sharply rebounded to $11,288 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a volatile financial trend over the three-year period. The decline in 2023 was driven by significant impairments such as IPRD impairments of $80 million and litigation settlements of $397 million, while the rebound in 2024 was supported by a rise in pretax income to $13,835 million and favorable income tax reserve releases of $502 million. This volatility suggests the company was navigating strategic adjustments, including restructuring and integration expenses, while managing the impact of impairments and litigation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BMY reported receiving $884 million in non-refundable upfront, milestone, and other licensing payments from Pfizer, which were amortized over the expected period of BMY\u2019s co-promotion obligation through market exclusivity. Both companies actively participated in joint executive and operating committees and shared responsibilities for research, development, distribution, sales, and marketing. By 2023 and 2024, this structure remained consistent, with the upfront and milestone payments still recorded under Deferred income and amortized in 'Other (income)/expense, net.' The global commercialization framework also remained unchanged, with BMY as principal in major markets and Pfizer handling smaller markets with BMY supplying at cost plus a percentage of net sales. This continuity indicates a stable long-term alliance structure with no material changes in financial treatment or operational responsibilities across the three years.",

In 2022, JNJ disclosed these categorizations as part of its collaboration framework. In 2023, JNJ reaffirmed this structure, maintaining the same classification for both payments made and received. By 2024, JNJ continued this approach but emphasized the receipt of such payments, suggesting a potential increase in collaborative funding or government support.

      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb's contingent tax matters showed a significant evolution from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, the company reported $522 million in tax benefits related to the resolution of Celgene's 2017-2019 IRS audit. In 2023, this figure decreased to $89 million in benefits for effectively settled contingent tax matters. By 2024, the company recorded $644 million in tax benefits related to the resolution of the same audit period, indicating a final settlement and closure of legacy Celgene tax uncertainties. This progression shows a strategic resolution of past tax exposures, with a notable spike in 2024 after a relatively low amount in 2023, suggesting a finalization of audit outcomes and a reduction in future contingent liabilities.",

      "answer": "BMY's 'Increase to Net Earnings' was $9,860 million in 2022, declined to $7,573 million in 2023, and then rose sharply to $11,288 million in 2024. This trajectory shows volatility, driven by changes in pretax income and income tax expenses. In 2022, the increase to pretax income was $11,965 million with income taxes on these items at $2,105 million. In 2023, pretax income dropped to $9,868 million, and taxes were $2,295 million, further compressing net earnings. By 2024, pretax income surged to $13,835 million, but taxes also increased to $2,547 million. Despite higher pretax income in 2024, tax burdens limited the net earnings growth compared to 2022, indicating a complex interplay of operational gains and rising tax liabilities.",

      "question": "How did Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial and operational relationship with Pfizer through shared operating committees evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of upfront and milestone payments amortization and geographic sales responsibilities?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Bristol-Myers Squibb's relationship with Pfizer through shared operating committees remained strategically consistent in structure but evolved in financial maturity. In 2022, BMS disclosed receiving $884 million in non-refundable upfront, milestone, and other licensing payments, which were amortized over the co-promotion obligation period through market exclusivity. By 2023, this amount was recorded under Deferred income and continued to be amortized into Other (income)/expense, net. In 2024, the same amortization framework persisted, indicating a stable long-term revenue recognition model. Operationally, BMS remained the principal for end-customer product sales in major markets including the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, China, Japan, and South Korea, while Pfizer retained full commercialization rights in smaller markets, receiving product at cost plus a percentage of net sales. This geographic division and joint committee structure remained consistent across all three years, reflecting a stable alliance framework with evolving financial maturity in payment recognition.",

        "Hop 1: [BMY](2022) \u2192 [Operating Committees]: BMY and Pfizer actively participated in joint executive and operating committees, with BMY receiving $884 million in non-refundable payments to be amortized over the co-promotion period.",
        "Hop 2: [BMY](2023) \u2192 [Operating Committees]: The upfront payments were recorded under Deferred income and amortized into Other (income)/expense, net, showing ongoing financial recognition of the alliance.",
        "Hop 3: [BMY](2024) \u2192 [Operating Committees]: The same amortization approach continued, with no structural change in the alliance or committee participation, indicating long-term stability in the financial and operational model."

This represents a total decrease of $658 million over the three-year period. The significant drop in 2024 suggests a major change in the company's rebate obligations, possibly due to improved forecasting, changes in rebate agreements, or a strategic shift in sales incentives.

      "question": "How did the treatment and financial impact of Research and Development Payments evolve in JNJ's earnings presentation from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of expense classification and reduction mechanisms across collaboration types?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, JNJ consistently classified 'Research and development payments to collaborative partner' as a direct expense under Research and Development, while 'Research and development payments received from collaborative partner or government entity' were treated as a reduction of R&D expense. In 2022 and 2023, this structure remained unchanged, indicating a stable accounting policy. However, in 2024, the phrasing around 'payments received' was emphasized more clearly, suggesting a potential increase in collaborative funding arrangements, which could signal a strategic shift toward greater external R&D cost-sharing. This evolution implies a growing reliance on collaborative R&D funding over time, with implications for JNJ's innovation strategy and financial risk management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [JNJ](2022) \u2192 [Research and Development Payments]: In 2022, JNJ classified both payments made to and received from collaborative partners under R&D expense and its reduction, respectively, indicating a structured accounting approach.",
        "Hop 2: [JNJ](2023) \u2192 [Research and Development Payments]: In 2023, JNJ maintained the same classification framework, showing consistency in how collaborative R&D payments were presented in financial statements.",
        "Hop 3: [JNJ](2024) \u2192 [Research and Development Payments]: In 2024, JNJ continued the same expense treatment but used slightly more explicit language around 'payments received,' possibly reflecting an increase in collaborative or government-sponsored R&D projects."

      "answer": "Amgen's accrued sales deductions increased from $5.2 billion as of December 31, 2021 (reported in the 2022 10-K), to $7.3 billion as of December 31, 2022 (reported in the 2023 10-K), and further to $8.4 billion as of December 31, 2023 (reported in the 2024 10-K). This consistent upward trend indicates a growing financial obligation related to rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, and discounts. The increase suggests either higher sales volumes under rebate-prone contracts, more aggressive discounting strategies, or a shift in product mix toward therapies with higher rebate exposure. Additionally, the complexity and materiality of these accruals remained a consistent audit focus across all three years, highlighting their significance to Amgen's financial reporting.",

The estimated sales deductions are based on current contractual and statutory requirements, market events and trends, internal and external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes. This included testing controls over management's review of significant assumptions and inputs used in the estimate of sales deductions, including actual sales, contractual terms, historical experience, wholesaler inventory levels, demand data and estimated patient population. We also tested management's controls over the accuracy of forecasting demand activity as well as the completeness and accuracy of the significant components included in the final sales deduction estimates. To test management's estimated sales deductions, we obtained management's calculations for the respective estimates and performed the following procedures, among others. We tested management's estimation process over the determination of sales discount accruals by developing an independent expectation of the estimated accrual balances, including comparing accrual balances recorded by management to those implied by historical payment trends, performing a lookback analysis using actual historical data to evaluate the forecasted amounts, assessing subsequent events to determine whether there was any new information that would require adjustment to the initial accruals, evaluating trends in actual sales and discount accrual |",

      "answer": "Amgen's investment in R&D Technology Rights related to Teneobio's proprietary technologies began in 2022 with the acquisition of $94 million in rights. In 2023, the company allocated $115 million to R&D Technology Rights from the Teneobio acquisition, which included proprietary bispecific and multispecific antibody technologies, and amortized this amount over 10 years. By 2024, Amgen maintained a stake in these rights as part of its broader R&D Technology Rights portfolio, which pertained to technologies used in research with alternative future uses.

All  IPR&amp;D  projects  have  major  risks  and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the development and commercialization of product candidates, including  our  ability  to  confirm  safety  and  efficacy  based  on  data  from  clinical  trials,  our  ability  to  obtain  necessary  regulatory approvals  and  our  ability  to  successfully  complete  these  tasks  within  budgeted  costs.  We  are  not  permitted  to  market  a  human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require the completion of clinical trials that demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective. In addition, the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans as well as competitive product launches, affect the revenues a product can generate. Consequently, the eventual realized values, if any, of acquired IPR&amp;D projects may vary from their estimated fair values. We review IPR&amp;D projects for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable and upon the establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired certain finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the Teneobio acquisition, including IPR&amp;D of $1.1 billion, R&amp;D technology rights of $94 million and licensing rights of $41 million. See Note 2, Acquisitions.\n\nDuring  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  we  recognized  amortization  associated  with  our  finite-lived intangible assets of $2.6 billion, $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets is included primarily in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total estimated amortization for our finite-lived intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, are $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.",

      "answer": "CVS's Pharmacy Claims and Discounts Payable liability increased from $19.423 billion in 2022 to $22.874 billion in 2023, and further to $24.166 billion in 2024. This consistent growth indicates expanding obligations tied to the company's PBM operations, suggesting increased prescription volume, deeper payer-provider contracts, or broader pharmacy network participation. The upward trend reflects a growing base of insured and discount-based pharmacy transactions, aligning with CVS's strategic focus on integrated health services and pharmacy benefit management.",

      "answer": "CVS's liabilities for IBNR plus expected development on reported claims increased from $6.6 billion at the end of 2022, to $8.7 billion at the end of 2023, and further rose to $11.3 billion at the end of 2024. This represents a consistent and significant upward trend over the three-year period. The increase suggests a growing exposure to healthcare claims, potentially due to expanding health care services, higher claim volumes, or increased cost per claim. The fact that substantially all liabilities in each year related to the current calendar year indicates that the company did not rely on prior-year reserves to cover these obligations, pointing to a real-time escalation in claim development risk.",

The company reiterated in each year\u2019s disclosure that it is 'impracticable to disclose claim frequency information' due to inconsistencies across its multiple claims processing systems. This recurring explanation highlights an ongoing challenge in standardizing and aggregating health care cost data across disparate systems, where any attempt to report claim frequency would lack comparability and consistency over time. The uniformity in disclosure methodology suggests a stable accounting policy, but also underscores systemic limitations in achieving granular visibility into claim volume trends.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's nondeductible liabilities increased from $296 million in 2022 to $329 million in 2023, and then slightly rose further to $343 million in 2024. This steady upward trend suggests a growing presence of tax liabilities that cannot be offset against future taxable income, potentially signaling either increasing long-term obligations or a strategic shift in how the company structures its liabilities. The consistent rise over three years indicates that UnitedHealth may be facing persistent nondeductible items or is intentionally allowing such liabilities to accumulate as part of broader tax planning or regulatory compliance strategies.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's deferred income tax asset for Accrued Expenses and Allowances was $707 million in 2022, increased to $754 million in 2023, and then significantly rose to $1,055 million in 2024. This represents a cumulative increase of 49% over the three-year period. The upward trend indicates a growing deferral of tax liabilities tied to accrued expenses, suggesting either increased accruals or changes in the timing of expense recognition for tax purposes.",

In both 2023 and 2024, MDT reported a tax benefit of $3 million related to performance share units, following the vesting of $78 million in fair value of these units in 2024. This indicates that while performance share units were granted in earlier years (with a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $149.16 in 2022), the actual vesting and associated tax benefits only materialized in 2023 and 2024, suggesting a delayed realization of compensation-related tax benefits aligned with long-term performance goals.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the difference between Medtronic's effective tax rate and its Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate was 4.3%. By 2023, this difference widened significantly to -15.7%, indicating a reversal where the effective tax rate exceeded the Non-GAAP rate. In 2024, the gap remained negative but narrowed slightly to -7.4%. This trend suggests that the company faced higher effective tax burdens during 2023, which were partially mitigated by 2024, while continuing to apply non-GAAP adjustments that reduced the apparent tax liability. The shift from a positive to a negative difference reflects a transformation in tax planning or regulatory environment affecting reported tax costs.",

In 2023, this turned into a deferred tax expense of $83 million, indicating a reversal. By 2024, the benefit returned but at a reduced level of $93 million. This pattern suggests volatility in MDT's international tax liabilities, potentially reflecting changes in profitability, geographic earnings mix, or tax planning strategies.

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Thermo Fisher Scientific consistently excluded inventory revaluation charges related to acquisitions from its adjusted results, indicating a sustained approach to managing acquisition-related financial impacts. In 2022, the company excluded charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the acquisition date. In 2023, this exclusion expanded to include both inventory revaluation charges and inventory write-downs associated with large-scale product line abandonments, signaling increased complexity or volume in integration activities. By 2024, while not explicitly quantifying the inventory revaluation charges, the company continued to disclose these adjustments within broader acquisition-related cost structures. This 3-year trend suggests that inventory revaluation remains a recurring element of the company's acquisition accounting, and its consistent exclusion from adjusted results reflects a strategic emphasis on presenting normalized operating performance to stakeholders.",

Adjusted results in 2021 exclude $767 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt.

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition-related measurements and income taxes. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nThe company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:\n\n## Acquisition-related Measurements\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company's acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolesce rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations.",

A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\nSee Note 1 and Note 3 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies.\n\n## Note 11.    Business Segment and Geographical Information\n\nThe company's financial performance is reported in four segments. A description of each segment follows.\n\nLife Sciences Solutions: provides an extensive portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines as well as diagnosis of infection and disease. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agricultural, clinical, healthcare, academic, and government markets.\n\nAnalytical Instruments: provides a broad offering of instruments and the supporting consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory and in the field. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government, environmental and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.\n\nSpecialty Diagnostics: offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products to serve customers in healthcare, clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial, and food safety laboratories. Our healthcare products are used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, which improves patient care in a more cost-efficient manner.\n\nLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services: offers virtually everything needed for the laboratory. Our unique combination of self-manufactured and sourced products and extensive service offering enables our customers to focus on their core activities and helps them to be more innovative, productive and cost-efficient. The segment also includes a comprehensive offering of outsourced services used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for drug development, clinical research, clinical trials services and commercial drug manufacturing.\n\nThe company's management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, restructuring and other costs, and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.\n\nThe company's president, chairman and chief executive officer is its chief operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM uses total revenues and segment income predominantly in the strategic plan, annual operating plan and quarterly business review processes. During these processes, the CODM considers budget-to-actual variances to evaluate both internal (e.g., changes in selling prices, strategic growth investments, productivity, business mix , newly acquired/divested businesses, etc.) and ex ternal (e.g., inflation, foreign currency, etc.) events and conditions.\n\nThe company generally accounts for intersegment revenues at current market prices.\n\nOther segment items included in the below tables consist of stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation expenses, allocations of corporate expenses and certain overhead expenses as well as elimination of intersegment and intrasegment profits, all of which are included in the company's measurement of segment income, but not regularly provided to the CODM at the segment level. Cost of revenues adjustments consist of charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, inventory write-downs associated with large-scale abandonments of product lines, and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to estimated salvage value in connection with the consolidation of operations. Selling, general and administrative adjustments consist of significant transaction/integration costs (including reimbursement thereof) related to recent/terminated acquisitions, charges/credits for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration, and charges related to product liability litigation. Restructuring and other costs include charges arising from headcount reductions and facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses on the sale of real estate and",

      "question": "How did Thermo Fisher's asset reserve requirements reflect evolving impairment risk assessments related to the lingering effects of the pandemic from 2022 to 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Thermo Fisher specifically noted that the ongoing uncertainties of the COVID-19 pandemic materially affected certain businesses, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment, and these risks were directly factored into asset reserve requirements and impairment assessments. By 2023, the company continued to disclose asset reserve requirements as a key estimate, but no longer singled out pandemic-related impacts, instead referring more generally to potential deviations between estimates and actual results. In 2024, the disclosures remained focused on asset reserve requirements as part of broader impairment risk assessments, but the pandemic was no longer mentioned as a material factor, indicating a shift toward normalized risk modeling. This progression shows that the company\u2019s asset reserve strategy evolved from pandemic-specific risk modeling in 2022 to a more generalized impairment risk framework by 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the company's subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $25 million, $24 million and $52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company's businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which",

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\n\nThe company owns 60% of its consolidated subsidiary PPD-SNBL K.K. The 40% ownership interest held by a third party is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet due to certain put options under which the third party may require the company to purchase the remaining ownership interest at a premium upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Presentation\n\nCertain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nAmounts and percentages reported within these consolidated financial statements are presented and calculated based on underlying unrounded amounts. As a result, the sum of components may not equal corresponding totals due to rounding.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents consists principally of money market funds and other marketable securities purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value (see Note 4).\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income.\n\n## Contract-related Balances\n\nAccounts receivable include unconditional rights to consideration from customers, which generally represent billings that do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers.",

The expiration schedule also evolved, with $149 million of the 2023 carryforwards set to expire between 2025 and 2033, and $201 million of the 2024 carryforwards expiring in the same period.

      "answer": "In 2022, Merck reported $43 million in inventory-related deferred tax assets and $423 million in liabilities. By 2023, the deferred tax assets increased to $86 million, while liabilities decreased slightly to $370 million. In 2024, the assets remained relatively stable at $84 million, but liabilities rose again to $413 million. This pattern shows an overall increase in deferred tax assets related to inventory, suggesting potential growth in inventory valuation or changes in tax accounting methods, while the fluctuation in liabilities indicates shifting tax positions or inventory write-downs across the years. The data reflects a dynamic approach to inventory management and tax planning, with a notable upward trend in asset recognition despite volatility in liabilities.",

      "answer": "Prevymis' sales grew significantly from 2022 through 2024, reflecting expanding market adoption. In 2022, sales increased due to uptake in the U.S. and Europe, with additional growth driven by the 2022 launch in China. In 2023, sales grew 41%, primarily from increased demand in the U.S. and Europe and the continued uptake from the China launch, following the FDA and EC approvals for kidney transplant recipients. By 2024, Prevymis generated $785 million in sales, up from $605 million in 2023 and $428 million in 2022, showing a consistent upward trajectory. This progression indicates strong market acceptance, geographic expansion, and the impact of regulatory approvals for new indications.",

The patent that provided market exclusivity  for Noxafil in  a  number  of  major  European  markets  expired  in  December  2019.  As  a  result,  the  Company  is experiencing lower demand for Noxafil in  these  markets due to generic competition and expects the decline to continue. Global sales of Noxafil declined 50% in 2020 due to generic competition in the U.S. and in Europe. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for certain forms of Noxafil representing the majority of U.S. Noxafil sales expired in July 2019.\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  Company  temporarily  suspended  sales  of Zerbaxa ,  a  combination  antibacterial  and  betalactamase  inhibitor  for  the  treatment  of  certain  bacterial  infections,  and  subsequently  issued  a  product  recall,  following  the identification of product sterility issues. As a result, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge in 2020 related to Zerbaxa (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021, which the Company expects to continue during 2022.\n\n## Immunology\n\n",

      "question": "How did Merck's reliance on government pricing calculations for U.S. rebate accruals evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the trajectory of the accrued liability ($2.6B in 2021, $2.3B in 2023, and $2.2B in 2024) indicate about the company's exposure to public sector pricing dynamics over time?",
      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Merck consistently relied on government pricing calculations as a core component of its U.S. rebate accruals for Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D programs. The accrued liability for these rebates decreased from $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2021 (reported in the 2022 filing), to $2.3 billion in 2023, and further to $2.2 billion in 2024. This declining trend suggests a reduction in Merck's estimated exposure to public sector rebate obligations over the three-year period, potentially reflecting changes in patient utilization, product mix, or pricing dynamics under government programs. Despite the decline, the consistent emphasis on government pricing calculations in each year's disclosures highlights the ongoing materiality and complexity of these obligations in Merck's financial reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MRK](2022) \u2192 [Government Pricing Calculations]: Merck used government pricing calculations as a key input in estimating $2.6B in U.S. rebate accruals for Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D as of December 31, 2021.",
        "Hop 2: [MRK](2023) \u2192 [Government Pricing Calculations]: In 2023, Merck continued to depend on government pricing calculations to estimate rebate accruals, with the liability decreasing to $2.3B as of December 31, 2023.",
        "Hop 3: [MRK](2024) \u2192 [Government Pricing Calculations]: By 2024, Merck still relied on government pricing calculations, with the rebate accrual further declining to $2.2B as of December 31, 2024."

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## U.S. Rebate Accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D\n\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records certain variable consideration including discounts, which are estimated at the time of sale generally using the expected value method. Amounts accrued for aggregate customer discounts are evaluated on a quarterly basis through comparison of information provided by the wholesalers, health maintenance organizations, pharmacy benefit managers, federal and state agencies, and other customers to the amounts accrued. Certain of these discounts representing a portion of the accrual take the form of rebates, which are amounts owed based upon definitive contractual agreements or legal requirements with private sector (Managed Care) and public sector (Medicaid and Medicare Part D) benefit providers, after the final dispensing of the product to a benefit plan participant. The provision for rebates is based on expected patient usage, as well as inventory levels in the distribution channel to determine the contractual obligation to the benefit providers. Management uses historical customer segment utilization mix, sales forecasts, changes to product mix and price, inventory levels in the distribution channel, government pricing calculations and prior payment history in order to estimate the expected provision. The accrued balance relative to the provision for rebates included in accrued and other current liabilities was $2.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, of which the majority relates to U.S. rebate accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care and Medicare Part D.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to U.S. rebate accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management due to the significant measurement uncertainty involved in developing the rebate accruals, as the accruals are based on assumptions developed using pricing information and historical customer segment utilization mix, and a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating evidence related to these assumptions.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to U.S. rebate accruals - Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D, including management's controls over the assumptions used to estimate the corresponding rebate accruals. These procedures also included, among others (i) developing an independent estimate of the rebate accruals by utilizing third party data on historical customer segment utilization mix in the U.S., pricing information, the terms of the specific rebate programs, and the historical trend of actual rebate claims paid, (ii) comparing the independent estimate to the rebate accruals recorded by management, and (iii) testing rebate claims paid, including evaluating those claims for consistency with the contractual terms of the Company's rebate agreements.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP Florham Park, New Jersey February 25, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Thermo Fisher Scientific consistently excluded inventory revaluation charges related to acquisitions from its adjusted results, but the specific context and associated costs evolved. In 2022, the company excluded charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the acquisition date and inventory write-downs tied to large-scale product line abandonments. In 2023, the company again excluded similar charges while also disclosing an additional $13 million of accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets due to facility consolidations. In 2024, while not explicitly quantifying inventory revaluation charges, the company provided broader context around its use of hedging instruments and segment-level adjustments, including charges for the sale of inventories revalued at acquisition. The continued exclusion and operational context suggest ongoing integration efforts and strategic product line rationalization following acquisitions.",

A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\nSee Note 1 and Note 3 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies.\n\n## Note 11.    Business Segment and Geographical Information\n\nThe company's financial performance is reported in four segments. A description of each segment follows.\n\nLife Sciences Solutions: provides an extensive portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines as well as diagnosis of infection and disease. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agricultural, clinical, healthcare, academic, and government markets.\n\nAnalytical Instruments: provides a broad offering of instruments and the supporting consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory and in the field. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government, environmental and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.\n\nSpecialty Diagnostics: offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products to serve customers in healthcare, clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial, and food safety laboratories. Our healthcare products are used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, which improves patient care in a more cost-efficient manner.\n\nLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services: offers virtually everything needed for the laboratory. Our unique combination of self-manufactured and sourced products and extensive service offering enables our customers to focus on their core activities and helps them to be more innovative, productive and cost-efficient. The segment also includes a comprehensive offering of outsourced services used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for drug development, clinical research, clinical trials services and commercial drug manufacturing.\n\nThe company's management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, restructuring and other costs, and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.\n\nThe company's president, chairman and chief executive officer is its chief operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM uses total revenues and segment income predominantly in the strategic plan, annual operating plan and quarterly business review processes. During these processes, the CODM considers budget-to-actual variances to evaluate both internal (e.g., changes in selling prices, strategic growth investments, productivity, business mix , newly acquired/divested businesses, etc.) and ex ternal (e.g., inflation, foreign currency, etc.) events and conditions.\n\nThe company generally accounts for intersegment revenues at current market prices.\n\nOther segment items included in the below tables consist of stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation expenses, allocations of corporate expenses and certain overhead expenses as well as elimination of intersegment and intrasegment profits, all of which are included in the company's measurement of segment income, but not regularly provided to the CODM at the segment level. Cost of revenues adjustments consist of charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, inventory write-downs associated with large-scale abandonments of product lines, and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to estimated salvage value in connection with the consolidation of operations. Selling, general and administrative adjustments consist of significant transaction/integration costs (including reimbursement thereof) related to recent/terminated acquisitions, charges/credits for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration, and charges related to product liability litigation. Restructuring and other costs include charges arising from headcount reductions and facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses on the sale of real estate and",

Adjusted results in 2020 exclude $4 million of accelerated depreciation on manufacturing assets to be abandoned due to facility consolidations and $2 million of charges to conform the accounting policies of recently acquired businesses with the company's accounting policies.\n\n(b) Adjusted results in 2021 and 2020 exclude certain third-party expenses (credits), principally transaction/integration costs (including reimbursement thereof) related to recent/terminated acquisitions; credits from changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration; and charges associated with product liability litigation.\n\n(c) Adjusted results in 2021 and 2020 exclude restructuring and other costs consisting principally of severance, abandoned facility and other expenses of headcount reductions within several businesses and real estate consolidations, and charges for impairment of acquired technology. Adjusted results in 2021 exclude $35 million of charges for compensation due to employees of recently acquired businesses at the date of acquisition.\n\n(d) Adjusted results in 2021 and 2020 exclude net gains on investments and charges for amortization of bridge loan commitment fees and entering hedging contracts for recent/terminated acquisitions. Adjusted results in 2021 exclude $767 million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt. Adjusted results in 2020 exclude $42 million of charges related to terminated interest rate swaps and $8 million of net charges for the settlement/curtailment of pension plans.\n\n(e) Adjusted provision for income taxes in 2021 and 2020 excludes the incremental tax benefit for the pre-tax reconciling items between GAAP and adjusted net income, incremental tax impacts from audit settlements and incremental tax impacts from adjusting the company's non-U.S. deferred tax balances as a result of tax rate changes.\n\n## Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\n\nThe company's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based upon its financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition-related measurements and income taxes. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nThe company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:\n\n## Acquisition-related Measurements\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company's acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolesce rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations.",

      "answer": "The aggregate intrinsic value of TMO's vested and unvested expected to vest shares was $2,035 million in 2022, decreased to $712 million in 2023, and further declined to $358 million in 2024. This represents a significant downward trend in the intrinsic value of these shares, indicating a substantial reduction in the value of unvested equity compensation over the three-year period. The decline may reflect changes in stock price performance, fewer high-value grants, or increased volatility in the company's share price.",

      "question": "How did Thermo Fisher's use of estimates for asset reserve requirements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to impairment risk assessments and the impact of external events like the COVID-19 pandemic?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Thermo Fisher included asset reserve requirements as part of its estimates, specifically referencing the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on certain businesses, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment, which experienced material adverse effects. In 2023, the company continued to disclose asset reserve requirements as part of its estimates but emphasized their role in assessing the risk of impairment for certain assets and businesses, without specific mention of pandemic-related impacts. By 2024, the company reiterated the importance of asset reserve requirements in evaluating impairment risk but no longer referenced the pandemic, indicating a normalization of operations and a continued focus on internal forecasting and asset management. The evolution shows a shift from pandemic-driven uncertainty in 2022 to a more stable, forward-looking impairment risk assessment by 2024.",

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\n\nThe company owns 60% of its consolidated subsidiary PPD-SNBL K.K. The 40% ownership interest held by a third party is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet due to certain put options under which the third party may require the company to purchase the remaining ownership interest at a premium upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Presentation\n\nCertain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nAmounts and percentages reported within these consolidated financial statements are presented and calculated based on underlying unrounded amounts. As a result, the sum of components may not equal corresponding totals due to rounding.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents consists principally of money market funds and other marketable securities purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value (see Note 4).\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income.\n\n## Contract-related Balances\n\nAccounts receivable include unconditional rights to consideration from customers, which generally represent billings that do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers.",

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the company's subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $25 million, $24 million and $52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company's businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, LLY's financial risk related to payer reimbursement evolved from a general concern about the inability to obtain or maintain reimbursement to an increased dependency on securing such reimbursement for new product candidates to sustain long-term growth. In 2022, LLY highlighted that failure to obtain or maintain payer reimbursement could result in limited commercial success for new products. In 2023, the company expanded this risk by emphasizing the difficulty in predicting revenue growth rates due to variability in demand and reimbursement challenges. By 2024, LLY explicitly stated that its long-term growth depended on maintaining payer reimbursement, particularly as new products required significant investment and faced high failure rates, making reimbursement a critical factor for commercial success and portfolio sustainability.",

To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products and indications.\n\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nWe must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products, both through our internal efforts and our business development activities, sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\n\nWe engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments. There are substantial risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions. Increased focus on business combinations in our industry, including by the Federal Trade Commission, and heightened competition for attractive targets has and could continue to delay, jeopardize or increase the costs of our business development activities. In addition, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses, products, or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution, and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or restructuring charges. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue and pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to developments outside our control, including unsuccessful clinical trials, issues related to the quality, integrity, or broad applicability of data, regulatory impediments, and commercialization challenges. Accordingly, business development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all), may not result in successful commercialization of any product, and may give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny.\n\nSee Item 1, \"Business - Research and Development - Phases of New Drug Development\" and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline,\" for more details about our current product pipeline.",

Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in ev aluating our company. It is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects could be materially adv ersely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believ e to be immaterial could also adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\n- Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies.\n\nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and dev elopment, the introduction of new products and indications, business development activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, and commercialization of our products.\n\nThere is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discov ery and dev elopment. To bring a product from the discov ery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial inv estment and following meaningful cost for manufacturing capabilities and inv entory to prepare for launch. As a result, a significant portion of funds inv ested in research and development programs will not generate direct financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in dev elopment or prior to being acquired may fail to reach the market or may hav e only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approv als or payer reimbursement or cov erage, failure to obtain placement on guidelines or recommendations published by third-party organizations that are commensurate with clinical data, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approv ed uses, label changes, changes in the relev ant treatment standards or the av ailability of newer, better, or more cost-effectiv e competitiv e products, difficulty or excessiv e costs to manufacture, insufficient infrastructure to support detection, diagnostic or other requisites for treatment, ineffectiv eness in connecting with healthcare professionals, including digitally through v irtual engagements, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. We may also fail to allocate research and dev elopment resources efficiently, fail to pursue or inv est sufficiently in product candidates or indications that may hav e been successful, or fail to optimally balance trial design, conduct, and speed to accomplish desired outcomes.\n\nRegulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delay, uncertainty, unpredictability, and inconsistency in drug approv al processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches, lost market opportunities, impairment of inv entories, and other negativ e impacts. In addition, it can be v ery difficult to predict rev enue growth rates of, or v ariability in demand for, new or future products and indications, which in some cases leads to difficulty meeting product demand or, on the other hand, lower v olume growth, excess inv entory and related financial charges.\n\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products and indications now under dev elopment will be approv ed or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approv al will be maintained; whether we will be able to dev elop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates, indications, or products; or whether our products and indications, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nThrough internal innov ation and business dev elopment we must maintain a flow of successful products and indications or line extensions sufficient both to cov er our substantial research and dev elopment costs and inv estments and to replace rev enues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls, lose intellectual property exclusiv ity, or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to timely replenish our product portfolio and pipeline would hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Our dependence on, or focus in, one or more key products or product classes exacerbates this risk. In addition, the growth of our business and rev enue base increases the risk that products dev eloped or acquired by us may not prov ide adequate v alue to sustain further long-term growth.\n\nWe engage in various forms of business dev elopment activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, codevelopment agreements, co-promotion arrangements, distribution",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Eli Lilly's actual U.S. product returns declined from less than 2% of U.S. revenue to less than 1%, while adjustments to revenue due to changes in estimates for sales returns remained below 1% in 2023 and rose slightly to less than 3% in 2024. Despite the company's limited visibility into retail inventory levels \u2014 as noted in all three filings \u2014 the consistent decline in actual returns suggests that Eli Lilly has maintained effective control over its distribution channel inventory.

          "chunk_text": "## Sales Returns - Background and Uncertainties\n\n- When product sales occur, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our sales, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales using an expected value approach. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (on average, approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, as well as any other specifically-identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuances, or a changing competitive environment. We maintain a returns policy that allows most U.S. customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusivity for a patentdependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimates to our assumptions. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed; we do not record a right of return asset. Our returns policies outside the U.S. are generally more restrictive than in the U.S. as returns are not allowed for reasons other than failure to meet product specifications in many countries. Our reserve for future product returns for product sales outside the U.S. is not material.\n- As a part of our process to estimate a reserve for product returns, we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products at the major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers; however, our data on inventory levels in the retail channel is more limited. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.\n- Actual U.S. product returns have been less than 2 percent of our U.S. revenue during each of the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of revenue, although fluctuations are more likely in periods following loss of patent exclusivity for major products in the U.S. market.\n\n## Adjustments to Revenue\n\nWe record adjustments to revenue as a result of changes in estimates, for the judgments described above, for our most significant U.S. sales returns, rebates and discounts liability balances. Such adjustments for products shipped in previous periods resulted in approximately 2 percent or less increase to U.S revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n## Collaboration and Other Arrangements\n\nWe recognize several types of revenue from our collaborations and other arrangements, which we discuss in general terms immediately below and more specifically in Note 4 for each of our material collaborations and other arrangements. Our collaborations and other arrangements are not contracts with customers but are evaluated to determine whether any aspects of the arrangements are contracts with customers.\n\n- Revenue related to products we sell pursuant to these arrangements is included in net product revenue, while other sources of revenue (e.g., royalties and profit sharing from our partner) are included in collaboration and other revenue.\n- Initial fees and developmental milestones we receive in collaborative and other similar arrangements from the partnering of our compounds under development are generally deferred and amortized into income through the expected product approval date.\n- Profit-sharing due from our collaboration partners, which is based upon gross margins reported to us by our partners, is recognized as collaboration and other revenue as earned.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LLY's tax provision was impacted by the Puerto Rico Excise Tax, GILTI tax, and other U.S. taxation of foreign income. In 2023, the impact included GILTI tax and Puerto Rico Excise Tax (specifically for 2022 and 2021), along with other U.S. taxation of foreign income, indicating a carryforward or ongoing effect of prior-year tax items. By 2024, the impact of U.S. taxation of foreign income again included GILTI tax and Puerto Rico Excise Tax, but this time only for 2022. This shows that while the Puerto Rico Excise Tax was no longer a current-year factor by 2024, its prior-year effects were still reflected in the tax provision, and the GILTI tax remained a consistent component across all three years. The evolution suggests a decreasing direct impact of the Puerto Rico Excise Tax over time, while the GILTI tax continued to influence LLY's global tax obligations.",

      "answer": "Gilead's global AmBisome sales declined from $540 million in 2022 to $492 million in 2023 and then slightly rebounded to $533 million in 2024. This fluctuation suggests a relatively stable but modest market position for AmBisome within Gilead's broader 'Other' therapeutic category, with geographic shifts in demand influencing performance across years.",

        "Hop 3: [GILD](2022) \u2192 [AmBisome Sales]: $540 million in total global sales, with volume growth noted outside the U.S., offsetting declines in Letairis sales, suggesting AmBisome was a key contributor to the 'Other' product category's stability."

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

      "question": "How did Gilead's reliance on HIV product sales as a core revenue driver evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year trend reveal about the company's revenue concentration risk?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Gilead's total HIV product sales amounted to $16.3 billion, representing a 4% decline compared to $16.9 billion in 2021. In 2023, the company disclosed that HIV product sales accounted for approximately 67% of its total product sales, signaling a continued heavy reliance on this therapeutic area. In 2024, the company reiterated the risk associated with this concentration, noting that sustained market share erosion or a shift away from nucleoside-based therapies like TAF could materially and adversely impact its business. This 3-year trend reveals a persistent revenue concentration risk in HIV, with limited signs of diversification, despite the potential for competitive and paradigmatic shifts in HIV treatment.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could,  in  circumstances  we  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict,  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operations,  growth,  reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "question": "How did Biktarvy's sales growth trajectory from 2022 to 2024 reflect patient switching patterns away from Genvoya and Truvada, and what does this reveal about Gilead's HIV treatment market dynamics during this period?",
      "answer": "Biktarvy sales grew significantly from $8.6 billion in 2021 to $11.9 billion in 2023 and reached $13.4 billion in 2024, showing a consistent upward trajectory. This growth coincided with declining sales of Genvoya (from $2.9 billion in 2021 to $1.8 billion in 2023) and Truvada (from $371 million in 2021 to $114 million in 2023). The 2022 filing explicitly noted that Genvoya's decline was driven by patients switching to Biktarvy, while Truvada's drop resulted from generic competition and Biktarvy's market capture. This pattern reveals a strategic shift in Gilead's HIV portfolio with Biktarvy becoming the dominant treatment option, driving revenue growth despite losses in other key products.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

      "answer": "Gilead's Vemlidy sales showed consistent growth across the three years: $814 million in 2022, $862 million in 2023, and $959 million in 2024. This represents a $145 million increase over the three-year period, indicating sustained demand and market expansion for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B. The growth trajectory suggests strong adoption across geographies and potentially improved pricing dynamics or reduced competition.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie projected that the post-65 health care cost trend would stabilize at 1.8% starting in 2029. By 2023, the company delayed this stabilization year to 2032, and in 2024, it maintained the 1.8% long-term assumption but extended the stabilization year further to 2033 for obligations remeasurement and 2032 for cost measurement. This indicates that while the company retained the same long-term trend assumption, it revised its timeline for when that trend would stabilize, reflecting a growing expectation of sustained higher health care inflation for retirees over the medium term.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie assumed the pre-65 health care cost trend rate would decline from 5.9% to 4.5% by 2029. By 2023, the company's assumption for the starting pre-65 rate had increased to 7.4%, with a projected decline to 4.5% by 2032. In 2024, the starting pre-65 rate assumption rose further to 6.6%, with a decline to 4.5% projected for 2033. This shows that AbbVie's expectations for near-term health care inflation pressures increased over the period, with the company consistently pushing out the timeline for reaching the 4.5% stabilization rate despite higher initial cost growth assumptions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer defined Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. In 2023, the definition remained largely consistent but shifted emphasis to amortization of intangible assets instead of purchase accounting. By 2024, the definition retained the amortization focus but showed a more condensed and streamlined presentation, indicating a maturing of the company's adjusted metrics framework. This evolution shows Pfizer refining its normalization adjustments to focus more consistently on amortization and acquisition-related impacts, helping investors better compare year-over-year performance on a normalized basis.",

      "question": "How did Pfizer's estimated deductions for U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's revenue forecasting accuracy and market dynamics?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's disclosures indicate that the company faced consistent challenges in estimating deductions for U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates across the three-year period. In 2022, the company recorded these estimated deductions as a reduction to gross product revenues, with a noted need for significant management judgment due to the up-to-one-year lag between sales and rebate payments. In 2023, auditors again emphasized the complexity of estimating the product-specific experience ratio, highlighting the continued importance of internal controls and historical data comparisons. By 2024, the same accrual methodology was applied, with auditors continuing to flag the estimation of rebate liabilities as a critical audit matter. The consistent focus on this accrual over three years suggests ongoing complexity in forecasting rebate obligations, indicating either persistent market uncertainty or structural challenges in Pfizer\u2019s rebate estimation process.",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statem ents present fairly, in all m aterial respects, the financial position of the Company as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended D ecem ber 31, 2024, in conform ity with U .S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the P ublic C om pany Accounting O versight Board (U nited States) (P C AO B), the C om pany's internal control over financial reporting as of D ecem ber 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by the C om m ittee of Sponsoring O rganizations of the Treadway Com m ission, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the C om pany's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statem ents are the responsibility of the C om pany's m anagem ent. O ur responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statem ents based on our audits. W e are a public accounting firm  registered with the P C AO B and are required to be independent with respect to the C om pany in accordance with the U .S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and E xchange C om m ission and the P C AO B.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the P C AO B. Those standards require that we plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statem ents are free of m aterial m isstatem ent, whether due to error or fraud. O ur audits included perform ing procedures to assess the risks of material m isstatem ent of the consolidated financial statem ents, whether due to error or fraud, and perform ing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the am ounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statem ents. O ur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estim ates m ade by m anagem ent, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statem ents. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit m atters com m unicated below are m atters arising from  the current period audit of the consolidated financial statem ents that were com m unicated or required to be communicated to the audit com m ittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are m aterial to the consolidated financial statem ents and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or com plex judgm ents. T he com m unication of critical audit m atters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statem ents, taken as a whole, and we are not, by com m unicating the critical audit m atters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit m atters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nEvaluation of the U .S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual\n\nAs discussed in N ote 1G  to the consolidated financial statem ents, the C om pany records estim ated deductions for M edicare, M edicaid, and perform ance-based contract rebates (collectively, U .S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. T he accrual for U .S. rebates is recorded in the sam e period that the corresponding revenues are recognized. The length of tim e between when a sale is m ade and when the U .S. rebate is paid by the C om pany can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant m anagem ent judgm ent and knowledge of m arket conditions and practices in estim ating the accrual.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the U .S. rebates accrual as a critical audit m atter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assum ption involved especially challenging auditor judgm ent. T he product-specific experience ratio assum ption relates to estim ating which of the C om pany's revenue transactions will ultim ately be subject to a related rebate.\n\nThe following are the prim ary procedures we perform ed to address this critical audit m atter. W e evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the C om pany's U .S. rebates accrual process related to the developm ent of the product-specific experience ratio assum ptions. W e estim ated the U .S. rebates accrual using internal inform ation and historical data and com pared the result to the C om pany's estim ated U .S. rebates accrual. W e evaluated the C om pany's ability to accurately estim ate the accrual for U .S. rebates by com paring historically recorded accruals to the actual am ount that was ultim ately paid by the C om pany.\n\n## Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\n\nAs discussed in N otes 5D  and 1Q , the C om pany's tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits m ay span m ultiple years. Since tax law is com plex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgm ents, it is uncertain whether som e of the C om pany's tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of D ecem ber 31, 2024, the C om pany has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $4.5 billion.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the C om pany's gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit m atter because a high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and com plex auditor judgm ent was required in evaluating the C om pany's interpretation of tax law and its estim ate of the ultim ate resolution of its tax positions.\n\nThe following are the prim ary procedures we perform ed to address this critical audit m atter. W e evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control over the C om pany's liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the C om pany's tax positions m ay not be sustained upon audit, and (3) estim ation and recording of the gross\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n49",

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Pfizer Inc.:\n\n## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1C to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for pension and postretirement plans in 2021 to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nEvaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual\n\nAs discussed in Note 1H to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performancebased contract rebates (collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the same period that the corresponding revenues are recognized. The length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant management judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involved especially challenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Company's revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the U.S. rebates accrual using internal information and historical data and compared the result to the Company's estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Company's ability to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S. rebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.\n\n## Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\n\nAs discussed in Notes 5D and 1 Q , the Company's tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the Company's tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $6.1 billion.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n49",

      "answer": "Pfizer's net equity/deficit attributable to shareholders deteriorated from a deficit of $2,862 million in 2022 to $2,924 million in 2024, with a $2,720 million deficit in 2023. This worsening deficit indicates increasing leverage as total liabilities grew faster than total assets across all three years: in 2022, liabilities were $9,777 million against assets of $7,057 million; in 2023, liabilities rose to $10,083 million against $7,245 million in assets; and in 2024, liabilities reached $10,485 million compared to $7,561 million in assets. This persistent downward trend in equity suggests declining financial flexibility and increasing reliance on debt financing over the three-year period.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Pfizer consistently excluded unusual items from Adjusted income, but notably expanded its rationale and scope in 2023 and 2024. In 2022, Pfizer explicitly stated that beginning in 2021, pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses were excluded from Adjusted income due to their unpredictable market volatility. This exclusion was reaffirmed in 2023 and 2024, with both years emphasizing that such items do not reflect core operations and are not within Pfizer\u2019s control. Additionally, in 2023 and 2024, Pfizer reinforced its reasoning by describing unusual items as those not part of ongoing business, non-recurring, or related to products no longer sold. The consistent exclusion of pension-related volatility across all three years shows a deliberate effort to present a normalized view of financial performance, while the elaboration in later years reflects a more strategic communication around the rationale for these exclusions.",

F or this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from  those costs incurred in other, m ore norm al, business contexts. T he integration and restructuring costs for a business com bination m ay occur over several years, with the m ore significant im pacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction.

          "chunk_text": "## Purchase Accounting Adjustments\n\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. Therefore, the Adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.\n\nThe exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&amp;D costs have been expensed. However, we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, such as different R&amp;D costs, timelines or resulting sales; accordingly, this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets internally.\n\n## Acquisition-Related Items\n\nAdjusted income excludes acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.\n\nThe significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nAdjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\n\n## Certain Significant Items\n\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. Gains and losses on equity securities have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information--Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items.\n\nBeginning in 2021, we exclude pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses from our measure of Adjusted income because of their inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n42",

      "question": "How did Amgen's accrued sales deductions evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does the 3-year progression suggest about the increasing complexity in estimating rebates and deductions for U.S. product sales?",
      "answer": "Amgen's accrued sales deductions increased from $5.2 billion in 2022 to $7.3 billion in 2023, and further to $8.4 billion in 2024. This consistent upward trend indicates a growing need for more complex estimation processes related to rebates, chargebacks, and discounts, particularly for U.S. product sales. The audit procedures also expanded over time, reflecting increased scrutiny and the material impact of these deductions on reported revenues. The rising accruals suggest either higher rebate obligations due to market dynamics or increased uncertainty in forecasting, both of which point to greater financial and operational complexity in revenue recognition.",

To test management's estimated sales deductions, we obtained management's calculations for the respective estimates and performed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |",

      "answer": "U.S. product sales grew from $17.3 billion in 2022 to $19.3 billion in 2023, and then to $23.3 billion in 2024, representing a 34.5% increase over the period. During the same timeframe, total product sales increased from $24.8 billion in 2022 to $32.0 billion in 2024, meaning U.S. sales accounted for 69.8% of total product sales in 2022, 71.8% in 2023, and 72.8% in 2024.

However, the net value of these rights declined significantly over the three-year period\u2014from $252 million in 2020 (2022 filing) to $166 million in 2023, and further to $139 million in 2024\u2014indicating increasing amortization pressure. Accumulated amortization for R&D technology rights rose from $1,065 million in 2020 (2022), to $1,228 million in 2023, and reached $1,235 million by 2024, showing a consistent decline in the remaining useful life of these assets. This trend suggests that Amgen may be transitioning from internally developed or acquired R&D technologies to more mature assets, potentially signaling a shift in innovation focus or a consolidation phase in its R&D portfolio strategy.",

      "answer": "Amgen's treatment of R&D technology rights from the Teneobio acquisition evolved significantly over the three-year period. In 2022, Amgen initially recognized $94 million in R&D technology rights as part of the Teneobio acquisition, with a broader context of intangible asset amortization totaling $2.5 billion for that year. By 2023, the company allocated $115 million specifically to R&D technology rights tied to Teneobio's proprietary bispecific and multispecific antibody technologies, and committed to a 10-year straight-line amortization schedule for this asset. In 2024, despite the termination of AMG 340 development in 2023, Amgen still maintained R&D technology rights as part of its intangible asset disclosures, indicating a continued strategic stake in the broader technology platform despite setbacks in specific drug candidates. This trajectory shows an initial acquisition-driven investment, followed by structured amortization planning, and ultimately a sustained commitment to the underlying technology despite project-specific failures.",

          "chunk_text": "\nDeveloped-product-technology rights  consists  of  rights  related  to  marketed  products  acquired  in  acquisitions.  Licensing  rights consists  primarily  of  contractual  rights  acquired  in  acquisitions  to  receive  future  milestone,  royalty  and  profit-sharing  payments; capitalized payments to third parties for milestones related to regulatory approvals to commercialize products; and up-front payments associated with royalty obligations for marketed products. Marketing-related rights consists primarily of rights related to the sale and distribution of marketed products. R&amp;D technology rights pertains to technologies used in R&amp;D that have alternative future uses.\n\nIPR&amp;D consists  of  R&amp;D  projects  acquired  in  a  business  combination  that  are  not  complete  at  the  time  of  acquisition  due  to remaining  technological  risks  and/or  lack  of  receipt  of  required  regulatory  approvals.  All  IPR&amp;D  projects  have  major  risks  and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the development and commercialization of product candidates, including  our  ability  to  confirm  safety  and  efficacy  based  on  data  from  clinical  trials,  our  ability  to  obtain  necessary  regulatory approvals  and  our  ability  to  successfully  complete  these  tasks  within  budgeted  costs.  We  are  not  permitted  to  market  a  human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require the completion of clinical trials that demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective. In addition, the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans as well as competitive product launches, affect the revenues a product can generate. Consequently, the eventual realized values, if any, of acquired IPR&amp;D projects may vary from their estimated fair values. We review IPR&amp;D projects for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable and upon the establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired certain finite-lived and indefinite-lived intangible assets as a result of the Teneobio acquisition, including IPR&amp;D of $1.1 billion, R&amp;D technology rights of $94 million and licensing rights of $41 million. See Note 2, Acquisitions.\n\nDuring  the  years  ended  December  31,  2021,  2020  and  2019,  we  recognized  amortization  associated  with  our  finite-lived intangible assets of $2.6 billion, $2.8 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets is included primarily in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total estimated amortization for our finite-lived intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026, are $2.5 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively.",

      "answer": "The evolution of inventory revaluation charges from 2022 to 2024 shows a clear trajectory of TMO\u2019s integration activities following acquisitions. In 2022, TMO excluded charges related to the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, indicating early-stage integration where acquired inventory was being liquidated or revalued under TMO\u2019s accounting policies. By 2023, the company not only continued excluding these charges but also added inventory write-downs associated with large-scale abandonment of product lines, suggesting active portfolio rationalization and integration of acquired product lines. In 2024, these charges were included in cost of revenue adjustments, showing that inventory revaluation had become a routine part of TMO\u2019s acquisition integration process. This progression indicates that TMO was systematically streamlining its product offerings and integrating acquired inventories into its core operations over the three-year period.",

The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to acquisition-related measurements and income taxes. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the consolidated financial statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain. Management bases its estimates on historical experience, current market and economic conditions and other assumptions that management believes are reasonable. The results of these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities where the values are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nThe company believes the following represent its critical accounting policies and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements:\n\n## Acquisition-related Measurements\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nThe company uses assumptions and estimates in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. The determination of the fair value of intangible assets, which represent a significant portion of the purchase price in many of the company's acquisitions, requires the use of significant judgment with regard to (i) the fair value and (ii) whether such intangibles are amortizable or non-amortizable and, if the former, the period and the method by which the intangible asset will be amortized. The company estimates the fair value of acquisition-related intangible assets principally based on projections of cash flows that will arise from identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses, which include estimates of customer attrition and technology obsolesce rates. The projected cash flows are discounted to determine the present value of the assets at the dates of acquisition. See Note 2 for additional information about our recent business combinations.",

A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\nSee Note 1 and Note 3 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies.\n\n## Note 11.    Business Segment and Geographical Information\n\nThe company's financial performance is reported in four segments. A description of each segment follows.\n\nLife Sciences Solutions: provides an extensive portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines as well as diagnosis of infection and disease. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agricultural, clinical, healthcare, academic, and government markets.\n\nAnalytical Instruments: provides a broad offering of instruments and the supporting consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory and in the field. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government, environmental and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.\n\nSpecialty Diagnostics: offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products to serve customers in healthcare, clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial, and food safety laboratories. Our healthcare products are used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, which improves patient care in a more cost-efficient manner.\n\nLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services: offers virtually everything needed for the laboratory. Our unique combination of self-manufactured and sourced products and extensive service offering enables our customers to focus on their core activities and helps them to be more innovative, productive and cost-efficient. The segment also includes a comprehensive offering of outsourced services used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for drug development, clinical research, clinical trials services and commercial drug manufacturing.\n\nThe company's management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, restructuring and other costs, and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.\n\nThe company's president, chairman and chief executive officer is its chief operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM uses total revenues and segment income predominantly in the strategic plan, annual operating plan and quarterly business review processes. During these processes, the CODM considers budget-to-actual variances to evaluate both internal (e.g., changes in selling prices, strategic growth investments, productivity, business mix , newly acquired/divested businesses, etc.) and ex ternal (e.g., inflation, foreign currency, etc.) events and conditions.\n\nThe company generally accounts for intersegment revenues at current market prices.\n\nOther segment items included in the below tables consist of stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation expenses, allocations of corporate expenses and certain overhead expenses as well as elimination of intersegment and intrasegment profits, all of which are included in the company's measurement of segment income, but not regularly provided to the CODM at the segment level. Cost of revenues adjustments consist of charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, inventory write-downs associated with large-scale abandonments of product lines, and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to estimated salvage value in connection with the consolidation of operations. Selling, general and administrative adjustments consist of significant transaction/integration costs (including reimbursement thereof) related to recent/terminated acquisitions, charges/credits for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration, and charges related to product liability litigation. Restructuring and other costs include charges arising from headcount reductions and facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses on the sale of real estate and",

      "question": "How did Thermo Fisher's disclosures regarding the risks and estimation methodology for asset reserve requirements evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of pandemic impacts, sensitivity to assumptions, and alignment with actual results?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Thermo Fisher specifically called out the material adverse impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on certain businesses, particularly the Analytical Instruments segment, which directly affected asset reserve requirements and impairments. By 2023, the company maintained the same core estimation methodology based on future cash flows and impairment risk but omitted any mention of pandemic-related impacts, suggesting a normalization of conditions. In 2024, while continuing to use the same estimation framework, the company emphasized that actual results could differ from estimates, indicating heightened sensitivity to assumptions and a more cautious stance on the reliability of asset reserve forecasts. This progression reveals a shift from pandemic-driven uncertainty in 2022 to a more generalized caution about estimation accuracy by 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [TMO](2022) \u2192 [Asset Reserve Requirements]: Disclosed that the ongoing pandemic materially affected certain businesses, particularly Analytical Instruments, impacting asset reserve requirements and impairment assessments.",
        "Hop 2: [TMO](2023) \u2192 [Asset Reserve Requirements]: Reiterated the same estimation methodology based on future cash flows but removed any reference to pandemic-related risks, suggesting stabilization.",
        "Hop 3: [TMO](2024) \u2192 [Asset Reserve Requirements]: Continued using the same estimation model but added emphasis on the potential divergence between estimates and actual results, signaling increased awareness of estimation risk."

          "chunk_text": "## THERMO FISHER SCIENTIFIC INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\n## Loss Contingencies\n\nAccruals are recorded for various contingencies, including legal proceedings, environmental, workers' compensation, product, general and auto liabilities, self-insurance and other claims that arise in the normal course of business. The accruals are based on management's judgment, historical claims experience, the probability of losses and, where applicable, the consideration of opinions of internal and/or external legal counsel and actuarial estimates. Additionally, the company records receivables from third-party insurers up to the amount of the loss when recovery has been determined to be probable. Certain liabilities acquired in acquisitions have been recorded at readily determinable fair values and, as such, were discounted to present value at the dates of acquisition.\n\n## Currency Translation\n\nAll assets and liabilities of the company's subsidiaries operating in non-U.S. dollar currencies are translated at period-end exchange rates. Resulting translation adjustments are reflected in the 'accumulated other comprehensive items' component of shareholders' equity. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates for the period. Currency transaction gains are included in the accompanying statement of income and in aggregate were $25 million, $24 million and $52 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Derivative Contracts\n\nThe company is exposed to certain risks relating to its ongoing business operations including changes to interest rates and currency exchange rates. The company uses derivative instruments primarily to manage currency exchange and interest rate risks. The company recognizes derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities and measures those instruments at fair value. If a derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in the fair value of the derivative are either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive items until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges are recorded at fair value through earnings.\n\nThe company uses short-term forward and option currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain balance sheet and operational exposures resulting from changes in currency exchange rates, predominantly intercompany loans and cash balances that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the respective operations. The currency-exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in euro, Swiss franc, British pounds sterling, Canadian dollars, Czech koruna, Japanese yen and Hong Kong dollars. The company does not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management.\n\nCash flow hedges . For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive items and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings and is presented in the same income statement line item as the earnings effect of the hedged item.\n\nFair value hedges. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge, the gain or loss on the derivative, as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk, are recognized in earnings.\n\nNet investment hedges. The company uses foreign currency-denominated debt and cross-currency interest rate swaps to partially hedge its net investments in foreign operations against adverse movements in exchange rates. A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and contract fair value changes on the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Risks and uncertainties associated with the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic materially adversely affected certain of the company's businesses in 2020, particularly in the Analytical Instruments segment and, to a lesser extent, some businesses within the other three segments. The negative impacts significantly lessened in 2021. The extent and duration of negative impacts in the future, which",

Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Nature of Operations\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (the company or Thermo Fisher) enables customers to make the world healthier, cleaner and safer by helping them accelerate life sciences research, solve complex analytical challenges, increase laboratory productivity, and improve patient health through diagnostics and the development and manufacture of life-changing therapies. Markets served include pharmaceutical and biotech, academic and government, industrial and applied, as well as healthcare and diagnostics.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe accompanying financial statements include the accounts of the company and its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries. All material intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Redeemable Noncontrolling Interest\n\nThe company owns 60% of its consolidated subsidiary PPD-SNBL K.K. The 40% ownership interest held by a third party is classified as a redeemable noncontrolling interest on the consolidated balance sheet due to certain put options under which the third party may require the company to purchase the remaining ownership interest at a premium upon the occurrence of certain events.\n\n## Presentation\n\nCertain reclassifications of prior year amounts have been made to conform to the current year presentation.\n\nAmounts and percentages reported within these consolidated financial statements are presented and calculated based on underlying unrounded amounts. As a result, the sum of components may not equal corresponding totals due to rounding.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n\nThe company's estimates include, among others, asset reserve requirements as well as the amounts of future cash flows associated with certain assets and businesses that are used in assessing the risk of impairment. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash equivalents consists principally of money market funds and other marketable securities purchased with a remaining maturity of three months or less. These investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value (see Note 4).\n\n## Inventories\n\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value, cost being determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The company periodically reviews quantities of inventories on hand and compares these amounts to the expected use of each product or product line. In addition, the company has certain inventory that is subject to fluctuating market pricing. The company records a charge to cost of sales for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value. Costs associated with the procurement of inventories, such as inbound freight charges, purchasing and receiving costs, and internal transfer costs, are included in cost of revenues in the accompanying statement of income.\n\n## Contract-related Balances\n\nAccounts receivable include unconditional rights to consideration from customers, which generally represent billings that do not bear interest. The company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimates of expected losses resulting from the inability of its customers to pay amounts due. The allowance for doubtful accounts is the company's best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable. The company determines the allowance based on history of similarly aged receivables, the creditworthiness of the customer, reasons for delinquency, current economic conditions, expectations associated with future events and circumstances where reasonable and supportable forecasts are available and any other information that is relevant to the judgment. Receivables from academic and government customers as well as large, well-capitalized commercial customers have historically experienced less collectability risk. Account balances are charged off against the allowance when the company believes it is probable the receivable will not be recovered. The company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to customers.",

The portion with expiration dates followed a similar pattern: $149 million in 2023 (of the $753 million) and $201 million in 2024 (of the $534 million).

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, the difference between Medtronic's effective tax rate (8.3%) and its Non-GAAP Nominal Tax Rate (12.6%) was -4.3%. By fiscal year 2023, this difference widened significantly to -15.7%, reflecting a sharp decline in the effective tax rate (29.5%) relative to the Non-GAAP rate (13.8%). In fiscal year 2024, the gap narrowed slightly to -7.4%, with the effective tax rate increasing to 23.4% and the Non-GAAP rate rising to 16.0%.

      "answer": "The fair value of restricted stock vested increased from $194 million in 2022 to $256 million in 2023, then declined to $186 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a significant spike in vested value during 2023, followed by a reversal in 2024 below the initial 2022 level.

      "answer": "Across 2022, 2023, and 2024, JNJ consistently classified 'Research and development payments to collaborative partner' as a Research and development expense, while 'Research and development payments received from collaborative partner or government entity' were treated as a reduction of R&D expense. In 2024, JNJ began explicitly receiving R&D payments, indicating a shift from merely disclosing the accounting treatment to actively benefiting from external funding. This suggests a growing collaborative R&D ecosystem where JNJ is not only investing but also securing co-funding, which may reflect increased strategic partnerships or government-supported innovation initiatives.",

By 2023, this reliance was maintained as the fair value increased to $21.69 per option, and the company continued to source implied volatility from market data.

In applying this model, the Company uses both historical data and current market data to estimate the fair value of its options. The Black-Scholes model requires several assumptions including expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, v olatility , and term of the options. The ex pected div idend y ield is based on historical patterns of div idend pay ments. The riskfree interest rate is based on the rate at grant date of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Notes with a term equal to the expected term of the option. Expected volatility is estimated using a blend of historical and implied volatility . The historical component is based on historical monthly price changes. The implied volatility is obtained  from  market  data  on  the  Company's  traded  options.

Income tax benefits for share-based compensation expense recognized in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $69 million, $65 million and $57 million, respectively.\n\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the fair value of option grants. In applying this  model,  the  Company uses both historical data and current market data to estimate the fair value of its options. The BlackScholes model requires several assumptions including expected dividend yield, risk-free interest rate, volatility, and term of the options. The expected dividend yield is based on historical patterns of dividend payments. The risk-free interest rate is based on the rate at grant date of zero-coupon U.S. Treasury Notes with a term equal to the expected term of the option. Expected volatility is estimated using a blend of historical and implied volatility. The historical component is based on historical monthly price changes. The implied volatility is obtained from market data on the Company's traded options. The expected life represents the amount of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, based on historical and forecasted exercise behavior.\n\nThe weighted average exercise price of options granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $75.99, $77.67 and $80.05 per option, respectively. The weighted average fair value of options granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $9.80, $9.93 and $10.63 per option, respectively, and were determined using the following assumptions:\n\n",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Merck's inventory-related deferred tax assets remained relatively stable, increasing slightly from $119 million in 2022 to $86 million in 2023, and then to $84 million in 2024. Meanwhile, inventory-related deferred tax liabilities increased steadily from $370 million in 2022 to $370 million in 2023, and then to $413 million in 2024.

      "answer": "To calculate the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of Prevymis sales from 2022 through 2024, we use the sales figures: $428 million in 2022, $605 million in 2023, and $785 million in 2024. The CAGR formula is (Ending Value / Beginning Value)^(1/n) - 1, where n is the number of years. Applying this: (785 / 428)^(1/2) - 1 = approximately 35.7%. This CAGR reflects a strong growth trajectory driven by higher demand in the U.S. and Europe in 2023, the 2022 launch in China, and the FDA and EC approvals in 2023 for additional indications, which likely expanded the eligible patient population and increased adoption.",

The patent that provided market exclusivity  for Noxafil in  a  number  of  major  European  markets  expired  in  December  2019.  As  a  result,  the  Company  is experiencing lower demand for Noxafil in  these  markets due to generic competition and expects the decline to continue. Global sales of Noxafil declined 50% in 2020 due to generic competition in the U.S. and in Europe. The patent that provided U.S. market exclusivity for certain forms of Noxafil representing the majority of U.S. Noxafil sales expired in July 2019.\n\nIn  December  2020,  the  Company  temporarily  suspended  sales  of Zerbaxa ,  a  combination  antibacterial  and  betalactamase  inhibitor  for  the  treatment  of  certain  bacterial  infections,  and  subsequently  issued  a  product  recall,  following  the identification of product sterility issues. As a result, the Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge in 2020 related to Zerbaxa (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). A phased resupply of Zerbaxa was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021, which the Company expects to continue during 2022.\n\n## Immunology\n\n",

      "question": "How did Merck's U.S. rebate accruals for Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's exposure to government pricing calculations over time?",
      "answer": "Merck's U.S. rebate accruals for Medicaid, Managed Care, and Medicare Part D decreased from $2.6 billion in 2022 to $2.3 billion in 2023, and further declined to $2.2 billion in 2024. This represents a total reduction of $400 million over the three-year period. The consistent focus on government pricing calculations as a key input in estimating these accruals indicates that Merck's financial exposure to public-sector rebate obligations has remained material but has modestly declined year-over-year. The multi-year trend suggests either improved forecasting accuracy, lower utilization in public programs, or strategic pricing adjustments that reduced rebate liabilities.",

      "question": "What does the trend in Pfizer's 'Other income/(deductions)-net' related to collaborative arrangements from 2022 to 2024 suggest about the company's financial performance from these partnerships, and how does this align with the evolution of alliance revenues over the same period?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's 'Other income/(deductions)-net' related to collaborative arrangements declined from $50 million in 2022 to $25 million in 2023, and further to a $15 million deduction in 2024, indicating a significant deterioration in net gains from these partnerships. Meanwhile, alliance revenues increased from $8,537 million in 2022 to $8,388 million in 2024 (with a dip to $7,582 million in 2023), suggesting that despite higher top-line contributions from alliances, the net benefit to Pfizer has decreased. This divergence implies rising costs or less favorable financial terms in collaborative arrangements over the three-year period.",

        "Hop 1: [PFE](2022) \u2192 [Other (income)/Deductions-Net]: In 2022, 'Other income/(deductions)-net' was $50 million, reflecting net gains from collaborative arrangements.",
        "Hop 2: [PFE](2023) \u2192 [Other (income)/Deductions-Net]: In 2023, this figure dropped to $25 million, signaling a reduction in net gains from the same type of arrangements.",
        "Hop 3: [PFE](2024) \u2192 [Other (income)/Deductions-Net]: By 2024, the metric turned negative at $(15) million, showing a net deduction from collaborative arrangements."

      "question": "How did Pfizer's Adjusted Cost of Sales definition and its relevance to operational performance evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of exclusions related to acquisition activities and intangible asset amortization?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Pfizer consistently defined Adjusted Cost of Sales as cost of sales before the impact of purchase accounting for acquisitions, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and certain significant items. In 2022, the exclusions included purchase accounting effects, while in 2023 and 2024, the focus shifted slightly to emphasize exclusions related to amortization of intangible assets alongside acquisition-related items. The relevance to performance remained consistent across all three years, emphasizing normalization for year-over-year comparability and internal management of recurring operations.",

        "Hop 2: [PFE](2023) \u2192 Adjusted Cost of Sales: Defined as cost of sales before amortization of intangible assets, acquisition-related items, discontinued operations, and significant items, with continued emphasis on normalized performance evaluation and forecasting.",
        "Hop 3: [PFE](2024) \u2192 Adjusted Cost of Sales: Maintained the 2023 definition, excluding amortization of intangible assets and acquisition-related items, with consistent messaging on its role in performance modeling and operational management."

      "question": "How did Pfizer's gross unrecognized tax benefits evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this three-year trend suggest about the company's tax position stability and audit risk exposure?",
      "answer": "Pfizer's gross unrecognized tax benefits were $6.1 billion as of December 31, 2021 (reported in the 2022 10-K), decreased to $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2023 (reported in the 2023 10-K), and further declined to $4.5 billion as of December 31, 2024 (reported in the 2024 10-K). This represents a consistent downward trend over the three-year period, indicating that the company either settled certain uncertain tax positions through audits or revised its estimates based on new interpretations of tax law. The reduction suggests improved clarity or resolution of tax positions over time, which may signal lower future audit risk or a more conservative approach to tax position estimation.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA\n\n## Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\n\n## To the Board of Directors and Shareholders Pfizer Inc.:\n\n## Opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Pfizer Inc. and Subsidiary Companies (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Change in Accounting Principle\n\nAs discussed in Note 1C to the consolidated financial statements, the Company has elected to change its method of accounting for pension and postretirement plans in 2021 to immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in the consolidated statements of income.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nEvaluation of the U.S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual\n\nAs discussed in Note 1H to the consolidated financial statements, the Company records estimated deductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and performancebased contract rebates (collectively, U.S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. The accrual for U.S. rebates is recorded in the same period that the corresponding revenues are recognized. The length of time between when a sale is made and when the U.S. rebate is paid by the Company can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant management judgment and knowledge of market conditions and practices in estimating the accrual.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the U.S. rebates accrual as a critical audit matter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assumption involved especially challenging auditor judgment. The product-specific experience ratio assumption relates to estimating which of the Company's revenue transactions will ultimately be subject to a related rebate.\n\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company's U.S. rebates accrual process related to the development of the product-specific experience ratio assumptions. We estimated the U.S. rebates accrual using internal information and historical data and compared the result to the Company's estimated U.S. rebates accrual. We evaluated the Company's ability to accurately estimate the accrual for U.S. rebates by comparing historically recorded accruals to the actual amount that was ultimately paid by the Company.\n\n## Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\n\nAs discussed in Notes 5D and 1 Q , the Company's tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits may span multiple years. Since tax law is complex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgments, it is uncertain whether some of the Company's tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $6.1 billion.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n49",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statem ents present fairly, in all m aterial respects, the financial position of the Company as of D ecem ber 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended D ecem ber 31, 2024, in conform ity with U .S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the P ublic C om pany Accounting O versight Board (U nited States) (P C AO B), the C om pany's internal control over financial reporting as of D ecem ber 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control -Integrated Framew ork (2013) issued by the C om m ittee of Sponsoring O rganizations of the Treadway Com m ission, and our report dated February 27, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the C om pany's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese consolidated financial statem ents are the responsibility of the C om pany's m anagem ent. O ur responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statem ents based on our audits. W e are a public accounting firm  registered with the P C AO B and are required to be independent with respect to the C om pany in accordance with the U .S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and E xchange C om m ission and the P C AO B.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the P C AO B. Those standards require that we plan and perform  the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statem ents are free of m aterial m isstatem ent, whether due to error or fraud. O ur audits included perform ing procedures to assess the risks of material m isstatem ent of the consolidated financial statem ents, whether due to error or fraud, and perform ing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included exam ining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the am ounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statem ents. O ur audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estim ates m ade by m anagem ent, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statem ents. W e believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit m atters com m unicated below are m atters arising from  the current period audit of the consolidated financial statem ents that were com m unicated or required to be communicated to the audit com m ittee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are m aterial to the consolidated financial statem ents and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or com plex judgm ents. T he com m unication of critical audit m atters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statem ents, taken as a whole, and we are not, by com m unicating the critical audit m atters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit m atters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\nEvaluation of the U .S. Medicare, Medicaid, and performance-based contract rebates accrual\n\nAs discussed in N ote 1G  to the consolidated financial statem ents, the C om pany records estim ated deductions for M edicare, M edicaid, and perform ance-based contract rebates (collectively, U .S. rebates) as a reduction to gross product revenues. T he accrual for U .S. rebates is recorded in the sam e period that the corresponding revenues are recognized. The length of tim e between when a sale is m ade and when the U .S. rebate is paid by the C om pany can be as long as one year, which increases the need for significant m anagem ent judgm ent and knowledge of m arket conditions and practices in estim ating the accrual.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of the U .S. rebates accrual as a critical audit m atter because the evaluation of the product-specific experience ratio assum ption involved especially challenging auditor judgm ent. T he product-specific experience ratio assum ption relates to estim ating which of the C om pany's revenue transactions will ultim ately be subject to a related rebate.\n\nThe following are the prim ary procedures we perform ed to address this critical audit m atter. W e evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the C om pany's U .S. rebates accrual process related to the developm ent of the product-specific experience ratio assum ptions. W e estim ated the U .S. rebates accrual using internal inform ation and historical data and com pared the result to the C om pany's estim ated U .S. rebates accrual. W e evaluated the C om pany's ability to accurately estim ate the accrual for U .S. rebates by com paring historically recorded accruals to the actual am ount that was ultim ately paid by the C om pany.\n\n## Evaluation of gross unrecognized tax benefits\n\nAs discussed in N otes 5D  and 1Q , the C om pany's tax positions are subject to audit by local taxing authorities in each respective tax jurisdiction, and the resolution of such audits m ay span m ultiple years. Since tax law is com plex and often subject to varied interpretations and judgm ents, it is uncertain whether som e of the C om pany's tax positions will be sustained upon audit. As of D ecem ber 31, 2024, the C om pany has recorded gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding associated interest, of $4.5 billion.\n\nWe identified the evaluation of certain of the C om pany's gross unrecognized tax benefits as a critical audit m atter because a high degree of audit effort, including specialized skills and knowledge, and com plex auditor judgm ent was required in evaluating the C om pany's interpretation of tax law and its estim ate of the ultim ate resolution of its tax positions.\n\nThe following are the prim ary procedures we perform ed to address this critical audit m atter. W e evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of an internal control over the C om pany's liability for unrecognized tax position process related to (1) interpretation of tax law, (2) evaluation of which of the C om pany's tax positions m ay not be sustained upon audit, and (3) estim ation and recording of the gross\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n49",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Pfizer consistently excluded legal charges, equity securities gains/losses, and pension-related remeasurements from its Adjusted Income, but the scope and rationale for these exclusions evolved. In 2022, Pfizer emphasized that legal charges often stemmed from unresolved litigation at acquired companies and that equity securities' volatility made them unsuitable for core performance evaluation. By 2023, the company expanded its explanation to include legal matters related to divested products, signaling a broader application of exclusions tied to legacy operations. In 2024, Pfizer reinforced its stance on excluding these items while also acknowledging the limitations of non-GAAP measures and the potential for recurrence of certain significant items, especially in response to external market pressures like biosimilar entry. This evolution shows a consistent yet increasingly nuanced approach to justifying non-GAAP exclusions, aligning with strategic shifts and investor transparency concerns.",

          "chunk_text": "## Purchase Accounting Adjustments\n\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant purchase accounting impacts resulting from business combinations and net asset acquisitions. These impacts can include the incremental charge to cost of sales from the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, amortization related to the increase in fair value of the acquired finite-lived intangible assets, and to a much lesser extent, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of the acquired fixed assets, amortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration. Therefore, the Adjusted income measure includes the revenues earned upon the sale of the acquired products without considering the acquisition cost of those products.\n\nThe exclusion of amortization attributable to acquired intangible assets provides management and investors an alternative view of our results by providing a degree of parity to internally developed intangible assets for which R&amp;D costs have been expensed. However, we have not factored in the impacts of any other differences that might have occurred if we had discovered and developed those intangible assets on our own, such as different R&amp;D costs, timelines or resulting sales; accordingly, this approach does not intend to be representative of the results that would have occurred if we had discovered and developed the acquired intangible assets internally.\n\n## Acquisition-Related Items\n\nAdjusted income excludes acquisition-related items, which are comprised of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business combinations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. We have made no adjustments for resulting synergies.\n\nThe significant costs incurred in connection with a business combination result primarily from the need to eliminate duplicate assets, activities or employees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. For this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from those costs incurred in other, more normal, business contexts. The integration and restructuring costs for a business combination may occur over several years, with the more significant impacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for some actions, the span of time needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.\n\n## Discontinued Operations\n\nAdjusted income excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. We believe that this presentation is meaningful to investors because, while we review our therapeutic areas and product lines for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. Restatements due to discontinued operations do not impact compensation or change the Adjusted income measure for the compensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\n\n## Certain Significant Items\n\nAdjusted income excludes certain significant items representing substantive and/or unusual items that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. Certain significant items may be highly variable and difficult to predict. Furthermore, in some cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For example, although major non-acquisition-related cost-reduction programs are specific to an event or goal with a defined term, we may have subsequent programs based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to LOE or economic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circumstances specific and, in some cases, may also be the result of litigation matters at acquired companies that were inestimable, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition. Gains and losses on equity securities have a very high degree of inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. Unusual items represent items that are not part of our ongoing business; items that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis; items that would be non-recurring; or items that relate to products we no longer sell. See the Reconciliations of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information--Certain Line Items below for a non-inclusive list of certain significant items.\n\nBeginning in 2021, we exclude pension and postretirement actuarial remeasurement gains and losses from our measure of Adjusted income because of their inherent market volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty and because we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business.\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n42",

          "chunk_text": "Adjusted incom e and its com ponents and Adjusted diluted E P S are non-G AAP  financial m easures that have no standardized m eaning prescribed by G AAP  and, therefore, are lim ited in their usefulness to investors. Because of their non-standardized definitions, they m ay not be com parable to the calculation of sim ilar m easures of other com panies and are presented to perm it investors to m ore fully understand how m anagem ent assesses perform ance. A lim itation of these m easures is that they provide a view of our operations without including all events during a period, and do not provide a com parable view of our perform ance to peers. These m easures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for their m ost directly comparable GAAP  m easures of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders , com ponents of Net income attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders and EPS attributable to Pfizer Inc. common shareholders-diluted , respectively.\n\nWe also recognize that, as internal m easures of perform ance, these m easures have lim itations, and we do not restrict our perform ance-m anagem ent process solely to these measures. We also use other tools designed to achieve the highest levels of perform ance. For exam ple, our R &amp;D  organization has productivity targets, upon which its effectiveness is m easured. In addition, total shareholder return, both on an absolute basis and relative to a publicly traded pharm aceutical index, plays a significant role in determ ining payouts under certain of our incentive com pensation plans.\n\n## Adjusted Income and Adjusted Diluted E PS\n\nAmortization of Intangible Assets -Adjusted incom e excludes all am ortization of intangible assets.\n\nAcquisition-Related Items-Adjusted incom e excludes certain acquisition-related item s, which are com posed of transaction, integration, restructuring charges and additional depreciation costs for business com binations because these costs are unique to each transaction and represent costs that were incurred to restructure and integrate businesses as a result of an acquisition. W e have m ade no adjustm ents for resulting synergies.\n\nThe significant costs incurred in connection with a business com bination result prim arily from  the need to elim inate duplicate assets, activities or em ployees--a natural result of acquiring a fully integrated set of activities. F or this reason, we believe that such costs incurred can be viewed differently in the context of an acquisition from  those costs incurred in other, m ore norm al, business contexts. T he integration and restructuring costs for a business com bination m ay occur over several years, with the m ore significant im pacts typically ending within three years of the relevant transaction. Because of the need for certain external approvals for som e actions, the span of tim e needed to achieve certain restructuring and integration activities can be lengthy.\n\nAcquisition-related item s m ay include purchase accounting im pacts such as the increm ental charge to cost of sales from  the sale of acquired inventory that was written up to fair value, depreciation related to the increase/decrease in fair value of acquired fixed assets, am ortization related to the increase in fair value of acquired debt, and the fair value changes for contingent consideration.\n\nDiscontinued Operations-Adjusted incom e excludes the results of discontinued operations, as well as any related gains or losses on the disposal of such operations. W e believe that this presentation is m eaningful to investors because, while we review our product portfolio for strategic fit with our operations, we do not build or run our business with the intent to discontinue parts of our business. R estatem ents due to discontinued operations do not im pact com pensation or change the Adjusted incom e m easure for the com pensation in respect of the restated periods, but are presented for consistency across all periods.\n\nCertain Significant Items-Adjusted incom e excludes certain significant item s representing substantive and/or unusual item s that are evaluated individually on a quantitative and qualitative basis. C ertain significant item s m ay be highly variable and difficult to predict. F urtherm ore, in som e cases it is reasonably possible that they could reoccur in future periods. For exam ple, although m ajor non-acquisition-related cost-reduction program s are specific to an event or goal with a defined term , we m ay have subsequent program s based on reorganizations of the business, cost productivity or in response to generic or biosim ilar entry or econom ic conditions. Legal charges to resolve litigation are also related to specific cases, which are facts and circum stances specific and, in som e cases, m ay also be the result of litigation m atters at acquired com panies that were inestim able, not probable or unresolved at the date of acquisition, or legal m atters related to divested products or businesses. G ains and losses on equity securities and pension and postretirem ent actuarial rem easurem ent gains and losses have a very high degree of inherent m arket volatility, which we do not control and cannot predict with any level of certainty, and we do not believe including these gains and losses assists investors in understanding our business or is reflective of our core operations and business. U nusual item s represent item s that are not part of our ongoing business; item s that, either as a result of their nature or size, we would not expect to occur as part of our norm al business on a regular basis; item s that would be non-recurring; or item s that relate to products we no longer sell.

      "question": "How did Gilead's AmBisome sales evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend reveal about the geographic demand dynamics for the product?",
      "answer": "AmBisome sales were $540 million in 2022, declined slightly to $492 million in 2023, and then increased to $533 million in 2024. The geographic breakdown reveals a consistent shift: U.S. sales remained relatively stable at around $40-44 million across the three years, while international markets showed more volatility. In 2022, international sales (Europe + Rest of World) totaled $497 million, dropping to $449 million in 2023 before rebounding to $489 million in 2024. This pattern suggests fluctuating demand in international markets, particularly in Europe, where sales declined from $274 million in 2022 to $260 million in 2023 before rising again to $276 million in 2024. The Rest of World segment showed growth, increasing from $227 million in 2022 to $212 million in 2023 and then to $212 million in 2024, indicating emerging market opportunities. The overall trajectory reflects a recovery in international demand by 2024 after a dip in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

      "question": "How did Gilead's HIV product sales evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend reveal about the company's dependence on and risks associated with its HIV portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Gilead's total HIV product sales were $16.315 billion, representing a 4% decline compared to the previous year. By 2023, HIV products accounted for approximately 67% of total product sales, indicating a continued heavy reliance on this segment despite declining growth trends. In 2024, the company highlighted growing risks to its HIV business, including market share erosion from generics and the potential for a paradigm shift away from nucleoside-based therapies like TAF, which underpin many of its HIV products. This 3-year progression shows a stable but vulnerable revenue base increasingly exposed to external threats, suggesting a potential inflection point for the company\u2019s core business.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\n\nIn evaluating our business, you should carefully consider the following discussion of material risks, events and uncertainties that make an investment in us speculative or risky in addition to the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. A manifestation of any of the following risks and uncertainties could,  in  circumstances  we  may  or  may  not  be  able  to  accurately  predict,  materially  and  adversely  affect  our  business  and  operations,  growth,  reputation (including the commercial or scientific reputation of our products), prospects, product pipeline and sales, operating and financial results, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and stock price. W e note these factors for investors as permitted by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. It is not possible to predict or identify all such factors; our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. Therefore, you should not consider the following risks to be a complete statement of all the potential risks or uncertainties that we face. Moreover, some of the factors, events and contingencies discussed below may have occurred in the past, but the disclosures below are not representations as to whether or not the factors, events or contingencies have occurred in the past, and instead reflect our beliefs and opinions as to the factors, events or contingencies that could materially and adversely affect us in the future.\n\n## Product and Commercialization Risks\n\n## Certain of our products subject us to additional or heightened risks.\n\n## HIV\n\nWe receive a substantial portion of our revenue from sales of our products for the treatment and prevention of HIV  infection. We may be unable to sustain or increase sales of our HIV  products for any number of reasons, including market share gains by competitive products, including generics, or the inability to introduce new HIV medications necessary to remain competitive. In such case, we may need to scale back our operations, including our future drug development and spending on research and development ('R&amp;D') efforts. For example, many of our HIV  products contain tenofovir alafenamide ('TAF'), which belongs to the nucleoside class of antiviral therapeutics. If there are any changes to the treatment or prevention paradigm for HIV , and nucleoside-based therapeutics do not remain the preferred regimen, our HIV product sales would be adversely impacted.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nAdvancing a novel and personalized therapy such as Y escarta or Tecartus, which are chimeric antigen receptor ('CAR') T-cell therapies, creates significant challenges, including:\n\n- educating and certifying medical personnel regarding the procedures and the potential side effects, such as cytokine release syndrome and neurologic toxicities, in compliance with the Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ('FDA');\n- securing sufficient supply of other medications to manage side effects, such as tocilizumab and corticosteroids, which may not be available in sufficient quantities, may not adequately control the side effects and/or may have detrimental impacts on the efficacy of cell therapy;\n- developing and maintaining a robust and reliable process for engineering a patient's T cells in our facilities and infusing them back into the patient; and\n- conditioning patients with chemotherapy in advance of administering our therapy, which may increase the risk of adverse side effects.\n\nThe use of engineered T cells as a potential cancer treatment is a recent development and may not be broadly accepted by physicians, patients, hospitals, cancer treatment centers, payers and others in the medical community. For example, in January 2024, FDA instituted a class labeling change for all approved CAR Tcell therapies, including a 'boxed warning' about the possible risk of secondary T-cell malignancies in patients treated with CAR T-cell therapy. For challenges related to the reimbursement of Y escarta and Tecartus, see also ' Our existing products are subject to reimbursement pressures from government agencies and other third parties, required rebates and discounts, and other pricing pressures.'\n\nWe rely on third-party sites to collect patients' white blood cells, known as apheresis centers, as well as shippers, couriers, and hospitals for the logistical collection of patients' white blood cells and ultimate delivery of Y escarta and Tecartus to patients. These vendors may encounter disruptions or difficulties that could result in product loss and regulatory action. Apheresis centers may also choose not to participate in our quality certification process, or we may be unable to complete such certification in a timely manner or at all, which could delay or constrain our manufacturing and commercialization efforts.",

      "question": "How did Biktarvy's contribution to Gilead's HIV product sales evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the drug's market dominance and Gilead's revenue trajectory in the HIV therapeutic area?",
      "answer": "Biktarvy's contribution to Gilead's HIV product sales increased consistently from 2022 through 2024, reflecting its growing market dominance and serving as a key revenue driver for Gilead in the HIV therapeutic area. In 2022, Biktarvy generated $10.39 billion in total sales globally, representing a significant portion of the $17.194 billion total HIV product sales for that year. In 2023, Biktarvy's sales rose to $11.85 billion out of $18.175 billion in total HIV sales, indicating a stronger relative performance within the HIV portfolio. By 2024, Biktarvy's sales had increased further to $13.423 billion, contributing to $19.612 billion in total HIV product sales. This represents a compound annual growth rate of approximately 13% for Biktarvy over the three-year period, demonstrating its sustained market leadership and Gilead's strategic reliance on the drug amid declining sales of other HIV products.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

      "question": "How did GILD's Vemlidy sales evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year trend indicate about the company's positioning in the chronic hepatitis B treatment market?",
      "answer": "GILD's Vemlidy sales increased steadily from $814 million in 2022 to $862 million in 2023, and further to $959 million in 2024, indicating consistent growth in the company's chronic hepatitis B treatment segment. This upward trajectory suggests that Vemlidy is gaining traction in the market, potentially benefiting from increased patient adoption, geographic expansion, or a shift in treatment preferences toward its profile (e.g., improved safety or efficacy). The growth contrasts with the decline seen in other legacy products like Viread and highlights Vemlidy's growing importance within GILD\u2019s Liver Disease portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: GILD(2022) \u2192 Vemlidy Sales: Vemlidy generated $814 million in sales in 2022, showing it was already a key contributor to the HBV/HDV portfolio.",
        "Hop 2: GILD(2023) \u2192 Vemlidy Sales: Vemlidy sales rose to $862 million in 2023, indicating early momentum and increasing adoption in the chronic hepatitis B market.",

          "chunk_text": "## Product Sales\n\n## HIV\n\nHIV product sales decreased by 4% to $16.3 billion in 2021, compared to $16.9 billion in 2020, due to the anticipated decline in sales volume of our Truvada (emtricitabine ('FTC') and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate ('TDF'))-based products driven by the continued generic competition following the October 2020 loss of exclusivity of Truvada and Atripla in the United States. Truvada and Atripla product sales were $1.3 billion lower in 2021, compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by lower sales of Genvoya driven by decrease in volume worldwide primarily due to patients switching to Biktarvy. These declines were partially offset  by  an  increase  in  Biktarvy  product  sales  worldwide  driven  by  higher  demand,  higher  net  average  selling  price  driven  by favorable changes in estimates of government rebates and discounts in the United States. We expect that our HIV business will continue  to  recover  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  2022.  We  also  expect  the  impact  of  the  Truvada  and  Atripla  loss  of exclusivity will be largely behind us starting in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Veklury\n\nVeklury product sales were $5.6 billion in 2021, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. Veklury became commercially available in the third quarter of 2020, resulting in a partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also attributable to higher hospital demand worldwide. Sales of Veklury are generally affected by COVID-19 related rates of infections, hospitalizations and vaccinations as well as the availability, uptake and effectiveness of alternative treatments for COVID-19. As a result, future sales of Veklury are difficult to predict.\n\n## HCV\n\nHCV product sales decreased by 9% to $1.9 billion in 2021, compared to $2.1 billion in 2020, primarily due to lower demand driven by fewer patient starts worldwide due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The slight increase in HCV sales in Europe in 2021 was due to a favorable change in estimate of government rebates, which offset the revenue decrease associated with lower demand.\n\n## HBV / HDV\n\nHBV and HDV product sales increased by 13% to $969 million in 2021, compared to $860 million in 2020, primarily due to higher Vemlidy  product  sales  due  to  higher  demand  in  all  geographies,  partially  offset  by  lower  Viread  product  sales  in  Other international locations. Hepcludex sales in 2021 were $37 million as launch activities continued across Europe following our first quarter 2021 acquisition of MYR.\n\n## Cell Therapy\n\nCell Therapy product sales, which include Yescarta and Tecartus, increased by 43% to $871 million in 2021, compared to $607 million in 2020. The growth was primarily due to the July 2020 launch of Tecartus in the United States for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory mantle cell lymphoma ('MCL') and the December 2020 launch of Tecartus for MCL in Europe, resulting in partial year of sales in 2020. The increase was also driven by continued higher demand for Yescarta worldwide for LBCL and volume growth related to approval of Yescarta for FL in the United States in 2021.\n\n## Trodelvy\n\nTrodelvy product sales increased to $380 million in 2021, compared to $49 million in 2020. We obtained Trodelvy through the  fourth  quarter  2020  acquisition  of  Immunomedics,  resulting  in  a  partial  year  of  sales  in  2020.  In  addition,  2021  revenues include continued uptake of Trodelvy following the full regulatory approval for metastatic TNBC in the United States and Europe and accelerated approval for metastatic UC in the United States.\n\n## Other Product Sales\n\nOther product sales, which include AmBisome, Cayston, Jyseleca, Letairis, Ranexa and Zydelig, were $1.0 billion in 2021 and remained flat as compared to 2020. AmBisome sales volume increased due to higher demand in geographies outside the United States.  The  increase  was  mostly  offset  by  lower  Letairis  sales  in  the  United  States,  as  anticipated,  due  to  continued  generic competition following the loss of exclusivity in 2019.\n\n## Gross-to-Net Deductions\n\nWe record product sales net of estimated government and other rebates and chargebacks, cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs. These deductions totaled $14.4 billion, or 35% of gross product sales in 2021, compared to $15.3 billion, or 39% of gross product sales in 2020. The reduction is driven by changes in product mix, primarily due to  higher  Veklury  sales  in  2021.  Of  the  $14.4  billion  in  2021,  $12.6  billion,  or  30%  of  gross  product  sales,  was  related  to government and other rebates and chargebacks and $1.8 billion was related to cash discounts for prompt payment, distributor fees, sales returns and other related costs.",

      "question": "How did LLY's dependency on payer reimbursement for commercial success evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to the risks associated with obtaining and maintaining reimbursement for new product candidates?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, LLY's dependency on payer reimbursement remained a critical factor in the commercial success of new product candidates, but the framing of this dependency evolved from a general risk to a more nuanced strategic concern. In 2022, LLY highlighted that failure to obtain or maintain payer reimbursement could limit the commercial success of new products, citing the high costs of R&D\u2014often exceeding $2 billion per drug\u2014and the risk that products may not generate returns. In 2023, the company reiterated this risk, emphasizing that inability to secure reimbursement or coverage was one of many potential failure points in drug development, alongside efficacy concerns and regulatory hurdles. By 2024, LLY expanded on this risk, noting that payer reimbursement was not only a prerequisite for commercial success but also influenced by broader market dynamics such as pricing controls, treatment guidelines, and digital engagement with healthcare professionals. This evolution shows a growing recognition of the complexity and strategic importance of payer dynamics in product commercialization.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LLY(2022) \u2192 Payer Reimbursement: LLY noted that inability to obtain or maintain payer reimbursement could prevent commercial success, despite promising development, and cited the high cost of R&D (often exceeding $2 billion per drug) as a key risk.",
        "Hop 2: LLY(2023) \u2192 Payer Reimbursement: LLY reiterated that failure to obtain or maintain payer reimbursement was a key risk in the lifecycle of a drug, alongside other commercial and regulatory uncertainties.",
        "Hop 3: LLY(2024) \u2192 Payer Reimbursement: LLY expanded the risk to include payer reimbursement being influenced by pricing controls, treatment guidelines, and digital engagement with healthcare professionals, indicating a more strategic view of the reimbursement landscape."

To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products and indications.\n\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nWe must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products, both through our internal efforts and our business development activities, sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\n\nWe engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments. There are substantial risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions. Increased focus on business combinations in our industry, including by the Federal Trade Commission, and heightened competition for attractive targets has and could continue to delay, jeopardize or increase the costs of our business development activities. In addition, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses, products, or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution, and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or restructuring charges. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue and pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to developments outside our control, including unsuccessful clinical trials, issues related to the quality, integrity, or broad applicability of data, regulatory impediments, and commercialization challenges. Accordingly, business development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all), may not result in successful commercialization of any product, and may give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny.\n\nSee Item 1, \"Business - Research and Development - Phases of New Drug Development\" and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline,\" for more details about our current product pipeline.",

Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in ev aluating our company. It is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects could be materially adv ersely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believ e to be immaterial could also adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\n- Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies.\n\nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and dev elopment, the introduction of new products and indications, business development activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, and commercialization of our products.\n\nThere is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discov ery and dev elopment. To bring a product from the discov ery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial inv estment and following meaningful cost for manufacturing capabilities and inv entory to prepare for launch. As a result, a significant portion of funds inv ested in research and development programs will not generate direct financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in dev elopment or prior to being acquired may fail to reach the market or may hav e only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approv als or payer reimbursement or cov erage, failure to obtain placement on guidelines or recommendations published by third-party organizations that are commensurate with clinical data, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approv ed uses, label changes, changes in the relev ant treatment standards or the av ailability of newer, better, or more cost-effectiv e competitiv e products, difficulty or excessiv e costs to manufacture, insufficient infrastructure to support detection, diagnostic or other requisites for treatment, ineffectiv eness in connecting with healthcare professionals, including digitally through v irtual engagements, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. We may also fail to allocate research and dev elopment resources efficiently, fail to pursue or inv est sufficiently in product candidates or indications that may hav e been successful, or fail to optimally balance trial design, conduct, and speed to accomplish desired outcomes.\n\nRegulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delay, uncertainty, unpredictability, and inconsistency in drug approv al processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches, lost market opportunities, impairment of inv entories, and other negativ e impacts. In addition, it can be v ery difficult to predict rev enue growth rates of, or v ariability in demand for, new or future products and indications, which in some cases leads to difficulty meeting product demand or, on the other hand, lower v olume growth, excess inv entory and related financial charges.\n\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products and indications now under dev elopment will be approv ed or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approv al will be maintained; whether we will be able to dev elop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates, indications, or products; or whether our products and indications, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nThrough internal innov ation and business dev elopment we must maintain a flow of successful products and indications or line extensions sufficient both to cov er our substantial research and dev elopment costs and inv estments and to replace rev enues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls, lose intellectual property exclusiv ity, or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to timely replenish our product portfolio and pipeline would hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Our dependence on, or focus in, one or more key products or product classes exacerbates this risk. In addition, the growth of our business and rev enue base increases the risk that products dev eloped or acquired by us may not prov ide adequate v alue to sustain further long-term growth.\n\nWe engage in various forms of business dev elopment activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, codevelopment agreements, co-promotion arrangements, distribution",

      "answer": "LLY's U.S. product returns as a percentage of revenue remained relatively stable from 2022 through 2024, with returns staying below 2% in 2022, below 1% in 2024, and also below 2% in 2023. This consistency suggests that LLY has maintained effective control over its retail inventory levels and return forecasting, despite challenges such as patent expirations and limited visibility into retail channel inventory. The slight decline in return percentages over the period may indicate improved inventory management or more accurate estimation techniques.",

          "chunk_text": "## Sales Returns - Background and Uncertainties\n\n- When product sales occur, to determine the appropriate transaction price for our sales, we estimate a reserve for future product returns related to those sales using an expected value approach. This estimate is based on several factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (on average, approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated levels of inventory in the wholesale and retail channels, as well as any other specifically-identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusivity, product recalls and discontinuances, or a changing competitive environment. We maintain a returns policy that allows most U.S. customers to return product for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusivity for a patentdependent product, we expect to experience an elevated level of product returns as product inventory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserve have been and may in the future be required based on revised estimates to our assumptions. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arrive at our net product revenue. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed; we do not record a right of return asset. Our returns policies outside the U.S. are generally more restrictive than in the U.S. as returns are not allowed for reasons other than failure to meet product specifications in many countries. Our reserve for future product returns for product sales outside the U.S. is not material.\n- As a part of our process to estimate a reserve for product returns, we regularly review the supply levels of our significant products at the major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by reviewing periodic inventory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and available prescription volume information for our products, or alternative approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inventory levels at an average of approximately one month or less on a consistent basis across our product portfolio. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements provides us with data on inventory levels at our wholesalers; however, our data on inventory levels in the retail channel is more limited. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.\n- Actual U.S. product returns have been less than 2 percent of our U.S. revenue during each of the past three years and have not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of revenue, although fluctuations are more likely in periods following loss of patent exclusivity for major products in the U.S. market.\n\n## Adjustments to Revenue\n\nWe record adjustments to revenue as a result of changes in estimates, for the judgments described above, for our most significant U.S. sales returns, rebates and discounts liability balances. Such adjustments for products shipped in previous periods resulted in approximately 2 percent or less increase to U.S revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n## Collaboration and Other Arrangements\n\nWe recognize several types of revenue from our collaborations and other arrangements, which we discuss in general terms immediately below and more specifically in Note 4 for each of our material collaborations and other arrangements. Our collaborations and other arrangements are not contracts with customers but are evaluated to determine whether any aspects of the arrangements are contracts with customers.\n\n- Revenue related to products we sell pursuant to these arrangements is included in net product revenue, while other sources of revenue (e.g., royalties and profit sharing from our partner) are included in collaboration and other revenue.\n- Initial fees and developmental milestones we receive in collaborative and other similar arrangements from the partnering of our compounds under development are generally deferred and amortized into income through the expected product approval date.\n- Profit-sharing due from our collaboration partners, which is based upon gross margins reported to us by our partners, is recognized as collaboration and other revenue as earned.",

In 2024, the GILTI tax and other U.S. foreign income taxation persisted, while the Puerto Rico Excise Tax was only noted for 2022, suggesting a shift in the geographic or structural tax exposure. Additionally, 2024 saw non-deductible IP R&D linked to the acquisition of Morphic, continuing the trend of tax implications tied to international acquisitions.

      "answer": "Danaher's effective tax rate fluctuated significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the rate was 11.4%, driven down by net deferred tax benefits from restructuring actions and other discrete items that reduced the rate by 7.0%. In 2023, the rate rose to 16.3%, with discrete benefits (such as the release of uncertain tax position reserves and stock-based compensation benefits) lowering the rate by only 0.9%, reflecting fewer tax optimization gains compared to the prior year. In 2024, the rate was again lower than 2023, with discrete tax benefits\u2014particularly from stock-based compensation and uncertain tax positions\u2014reducing the rate by 1.4%. This trajectory reveals a pattern of strategic tax planning in 2022, followed by a normalization in 2023, and renewed tax optimization efforts in 2024, including restructuring-related actions and international tax positioning.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [DHR](2022) \u2192 [Reported Rate]: The effective tax rate was 11.4%, significantly below the statutory rate, primarily due to deferred tax benefits from legal and operational restructuring that reduced the rate by 7.0%.",
        "Hop 2: [DHR](2023) \u2192 [Reported Rate]: The effective tax rate increased to 16.3%, with discrete benefits reducing the rate by only 0.9%, indicating a moderation in tax optimization activity compared to 2022.",

These items decreased the reported rate on a net basis by 3.5%.\n- The effective tax rate of 18.9% in 2020 includes net tax benefits primarily related to the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions from audit settlements and expiration of statutes of limitation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, partially offset by a higher tax rate associated with the gain on the divestiture of certain product lines in the Life Sciences segment and changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions. These items decreased the reported rate on a net basis by 0.7%.\n- The effective tax rate of 26.4% in 2019 includes 650 basis points of tax charges related primarily to changes in estimates associated with prior period uncertain tax positions, audit settlements, and Envista Disposition costs, net of the release of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation, release of valuation allowances associated with certain non-U.S. tax credits, tax benefits resulting from changes in tax law and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.\n\nThe Company made income tax payments related to both continuing and discontinued operations of approximately $1.7 billion, $1.1 billion and $847 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Current income taxes payable related to both continuing and discontinued operations has been reduced by $118 million, $110 million and $79 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for tax deductions attributable to stock-based compensation, of which, the excess tax benefit over the amount recorded for financial reporting purposes for both continuing and discontinued operations was $95 million, $85 million and $55 million, respectively. The excess tax benefits have been recorded as reductions to the current income tax provision and are reflected as operating cash inflows in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nIncluded in deferred income taxes as of December 31, 2021 are tax benefits for U.S. and non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards totaling $427 million ($172 million of which the Company does not expect to realize and have corresponding valuation allowances). Certain of the losses can be carried forward indefinitely and others can be carried forward to various dates from 2022 through 2041. In addition, the Company had general business and non-U.S. tax credit carryforwards of $117 million ($58 million of which the Company does not expect to realize and have corresponding valuation allowances) as of December 31, 2021, which can be carried forward to various dates from 2022 to 2031.

During the same period, the company's doubtful accounts expense was $31 million in 2022, increased to $43 million in 2023, and then declined to $37 million in 2024. This pattern indicates that despite a significant reduction in financing receivables in 2023, credit risk as reflected in doubtful accounts expense peaked that year, suggesting higher-than-expected credit losses on the portfolio. In 2024, with a modest increase in receivables, the expense declined, indicating either improved credit quality or more conservative estimation practices.",

The Company does not believe that trade accounts receivable represent significant concentrations of credit risk because of the diversified portfolio of individual customers and geographical areas. On January 1, 2020, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments-Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments , using the modified retrospective transition method and recorded a net increase to the allowance for doubtful accounts of $10 million due to the cumulative impact of adoption. The Company's allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2021 reflects the Company's best estimate of the expected future losses for its accounts receivables; however, these estimates may change and future actual losses may differ from the Company's estimates. The Company will continue to monitor economic conditions and will revise the estimates of the expected future losses for accounts receivable as necessary. The Company recorded $31 million, $31 million and $30 million of expense associated with doubtful accounts for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\nIncluded in the Company's trade accounts receivable and other long-term assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are $247 million and $254 million of net aggregate financing receivables, respectively. All financing receivables are evaluated for impairment based on individual customer credit profiles.\n\nInventories-Inventories include the costs of material, labor and overhead.

      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie assumed a long-term post-65 health care cost trend rate of 2.0% for measuring 2021 post-retirement obligations, which was set to decline to 1.8% by 2029. In 2023, the company adjusted its long-term assumption to a 2.1% post-65 rate, projected to decline to 1.8% by 2032. By 2024, the long-term post-65 rate was again 2.1% for obligations and 2.0% for costs, both expected to reach 1.8% by 2033. Despite slight variations in the initial assumed rates across years, the long-term target of 1.8% remained consistent, indicating that AbbVie's actuarial forecasting for retiree health care liabilities reflects a deliberate and stable long-term outlook, even as short-term assumptions were adjusted in response to evolving conditions.",

This shows a consistent downward adjustment in expected long-term post-65 healthcare cost inflation, with the timeline for reaching the assumed steady-state rate extending further into the future.

      "answer": "ABBV's allocation to Level 2 investments within its total assets measured at NAV increased from $1,201 million in 2022 to $941 million in 2023, before rising again to $1,239 million in 2024. This fluctuation indicates a dynamic approach to pension fund management, with a general return to higher reliance on Level 2 inputs by 2024, suggesting a strategic preference for observable market data in valuing a portion of its plan assets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie assumed a 5.9% pre-65 annual rate of increase for post-retirement health care obligations, projecting it would decline to 4.5% by 2029. In 2023, the assumed rate rose to 7.4% for the remeasurement, with a projected decline to 4.5% by 2032. In 2024, the remeasurement assumption dropped to 6.6%, still projected to reach 4.5% by 2033. This shows a volatile but gradually moderating trend in assumed health care cost growth, with the company adjusting its near-term projections while maintaining the long-term terminal rate of 4.5%.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BMY disclosed $11.4 billion in IPRD, with $11.1 billion tied to mavacamten, reflecting a major strategic bet on the asset. By 2023, BMY shifted $2.8 billion of IPRD previously allocated to repotrectinib (Augtyro) to 'Acquired marketed product rights' upon FDA approval, signaling a pivot from IPRD to commercialized asset recognition. In 2024, BMY significantly increased its investment in IPRD, reporting $13.373 billion in acquired IPRD\u2014up from $913 million in 2023\u2014indicating renewed emphasis on early-stage innovation. This 3-year trajectory shows a strategic evolution from high-stakes IPRD bets (mavacamten), to partial realization and reclassification (repotrectinib), and then to renewed investment in new IPRD assets, suggesting a dynamic R&D strategy balancing pipeline prioritization with commercial opportunity.",

In 2022, the benefit was primarily due to effectively settled contingent tax matters, while 2023 saw a significant decline, likely due to the resolution of prior contingencies.

BMS operates under a favorable tax grant in Puerto Rico not scheduled to expire prior to 2023.\n\nInternal transfers of certain intangible and other assets to streamline our legal entity structure subsequent to the Celgene acquisition resulted in a tax benefit in 2021 and in a tax charge in 2020 upon adjusting deferred taxes for the book and revalued tax basis differences of the related assets.\n\nU.S. Federal, state and foreign contingent tax matters includes an $81 million tax benefit in 2019 with respect to lapse of statutes.\n\nFair value adjustments for contingent value rights are not taxable or tax deductible.\n\nNon-deductible R&amp;D charges primarily resulted from the $11.4 billion MyoKardia IPRD charge in 2020.\n\nPuerto Rico imposes an excise tax on the gross company purchase price of goods sold from BMS's manufacturer in Puerto Rico. The excise tax is recognized in Cost of products sold when the intra-entity sale occurs. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax is  not  deductible  but  results  in  foreign  tax  credits  that  are  generally  recognized  in  BMS's  provision  for  income  taxes  when  the excise tax is incurred.",

      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb's Alliance and Other Revenues fluctuated over the 3-year period: it was $1,488 million in 2022, declined to $1,228 million in 2023, and then increased to $1,522 million in 2024.

      "question": "How did the 'Increase to Net Earnings' evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year progression reveal about Bristol-Myers Squibb's financial performance and strategic adjustments, particularly in relation to impairments, restructuring, and tax impacts?",
      "answer": "Bristol-Myers Squibb's 'Increase to Net Earnings' fluctuated significantly over the three-year period: it was $9,860 million in 2022, dropped to $7,573 million in 2023, and then increased sharply to $11,288 million in 2024. This trajectory reveals a strategic pivot in 2024 that included a substantial rise in intangible asset impairments ($1,839 million in 2024 vs. $27 million in 2023), higher restructuring and provision for restructuring costs ($635 million in 2024 vs. $365 million in 2023), and a notable increase in tax expenses ($2,547 million in 2024 vs. $2,295 million in 2023). These changes suggest a deliberate realignment of the company\u2019s asset base and operational structure, with 2023 reflecting a transitional year of cost containment and 2024 showing the impact of strategic investments and restructuring.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Bristol Myers Squibb's arrangement with Pfizer for Eliquis remained largely consistent in structure but showed continued execution of long-term commitments. In 2022, BMS disclosed receiving $884 million in non-refundable upfront, milestone, and other licensing payments, which were amortized over the expected co-promotion period through market exclusivity. By 2023 and 2024, the financial structure remained unchanged, with both parties continuing to actively participate in joint executive and operating committees, sharing responsibilities for research, development, distribution, sales, and marketing. BMS remained the principal for end-customer sales in major markets including the U.S., Europe, Canada, Australia, China, Japan, and South Korea, while Pfizer retained full commercialization rights in smaller markets, with BMS supplying the product at cost plus a percentage of net sales. The consistent language across filings indicates a stable and ongoing partnership with no material changes to the financial or operational framework during the three-year period.",

      "answer": "AbbVie consistently projected a 2.0% post-65 annual rate of increase in per capita health care costs in its disclosures for 2022, 2023, and 2024, despite fluctuations in the pre-65 rate across the years. This stable assumption for post-65 health care inflation suggests that the company maintained a steady long-term outlook for retiree health care cost trends, even as other variables in its actuarial models changed. The persistence of the 2.0% figure across three consecutive years indicates a deliberate and confident projection, likely reflecting internal modeling or external actuarial benchmarks that remained stable over this period.",

      "answer": "ABBV's pension plan assets measured at NAV showed a notable evolution from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, total assets measured at NAV were $6,152 million, with Level 1 assets (quoted prices in active markets) amounting to $3,302 million and Level 2 assets (significant other observable inputs) totaling $1,201 million. By 2023, total NAV assets decreased to $5,112 million, with Level 1 assets at $2,419 million and Level 2 assets at $941 million. In 2024, total NAV assets increased significantly to $6,920 million, with Level 1 assets at $2,392 million and Level 2 assets rising to $1,239 million. This pattern indicates a shift in strategy: while 2023 saw a reduction in both total NAV assets and a proportional decrease in Level 2 assets, 2024 witnessed a rebound in total assets with a notable increase in Level 2 allocations. This suggests that ABBV\u2019s pension fund managers may have pursued a more diversified and potentially risk-adjusted approach in 2024, increasing reliance on observable market inputs (Level 2) while maintaining a relatively stable Level 1 position, following a year of contraction in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AbbVie assumed a 5.9% pre-65 health care cost inflation rate for the 2021 remeasurement, projecting it would decline to 4.5% by 2029. In 2023, the company increased its assumed rate for the 2023 remeasurement to 7.4%, now expecting it to decrease to 4.5% by 2032, and also projected a 6.2% rate for 2023 costs decreasing to 4.5% by 2030. In 2024, the company assumed a 6.6% rate for the 2024 remeasurement, projecting it would reach 4.5% by 2033, and a 7.4% rate for 2024 costs, also declining to 4.5% by 2032. This indicates a volatile trend where AbbVie initially increased its near-term inflation assumptions in 2023 before slightly moderating them in 2024, while consistently anchoring long-term expectations at 4.5%. The pattern suggests growing but stabilizing expectations of health care cost pressures over time.",

      "question": "How did Abbott's strategic positioning and competitive exposure in the Nutritional Products segment evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of goodwill allocation and competitive pressures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott reported $286 million in goodwill allocated to the Nutritional Products segment, indicating a stable valuation with no impairments. By 2023, this goodwill slightly declined to $285 million, maintaining the same non-impairment stance despite broader acquisition-driven increases in other segments. In 2024, the Nutritional Products segment faced intensified competitive pressures from diversified consumer and healthcare manufacturers, with competition centered on innovation, formulation, and retail distribution. This suggests a stable financial commitment to the segment but growing external challenges over time.",

Net actuarial losses and prior service cost is included as a component of net periodic benefit cost - see Note 13 for additional information.\n\n## Note 6 - Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n\nThe total amount of goodwill reported was $23.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and $23.7 billion at December 31, 2020. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased goodwill by $532 million in 2021 and increased goodwill by $550 million in 2020. The amount of goodwill related to reportable segments at December 31, 2021 was $2.8 billion for the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment, $286 million for the Nutritional Products segment, $3.7 billion for the  Diagnostic  Products  segment,  and  $16.4  billion  for  the  Medical  Devices  segment.  There  were  no  reductions  of goodwill relating to impairments in 2021 and 2020.\n\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets, which relate to IPR&amp;D acquired in a business combination, were approximately $919  million  and  $1.2  billion  at  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  The  decrease  is  due  to  IPR&amp;D  assets primarily related to the Medical Devices segment that became amortizable in 2021, partially offset by an increase of approximately $80 million related to a recent acquisition. In 2020, a $55 million impairment of an IPR&amp;D intangible asset  related  to  the  Medical  Devices  segment  was  recorded  in  the  Research  and  development  line  of  Abbott's Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nThe gross amount of amortizable intangible assets, primarily product rights and technology, was $27.7 billion and $27.8 billion  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively,  and  accumulated  amortization  was  $15.9  billion  and $14.2 billion as of December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  Amortizable intangible assets increased  by approximately $120 million as a result of a recent acquisition and the additional assets are being amortized over 9 years. Foreign currency translation adjustments decreased intangible assets by $197 million in 2021 and increased intangible assets by $67 million in 2020. In 2021, asset impairments related to the Established Pharmaceutical Products segment decreased  intangible  assets  by  $14  million.  In  2020,  asset  impairments  related  to  the  Medical  Devices  segment decreased intangible assets by $148 million. The impairments were recorded in the Cost of products sold, excluding amortization  of  intangible  assets  line  of  Abbott's  Consolidated  Statement  of  Earnings.  The  estimated  annual amortization expense for intangible assets recorded at December 31, 2021 is approximately $2.1 billion in 2022, $2.0 billion in 2023, $1.9 billion in 2024, $1.7 billion in 2025 and $1.6 billion in 2026. Amortizable intangible assets are amortized over 2 to 20 years.",

Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail distribution, and availability of product forms. A significant aspect of competition is the search for ingredient innovations. The introduction of new products by competitors, changes in medical practices and procedures, and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure.\n\n## Medical Devices\n\nThese  products  include  a  broad  line  of  rhythm  management,  electrophysiology,  heart  failure,  vascular  and  structural  heart  devices  for  the  treatment  of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care and continuous glucose monitoring products, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders.  Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide.  In the  United  States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally marketed and sold directly to wholesalers, hospitals, ambulatory surgery centers, physicians' offices, consumers, and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers, public warehouses or third party distributors.

This pattern indicates a volatile trend over the three-year period. The drop in 2023 may reflect short-term challenges or strategic divestitures, while the sharp rebound in 2024 suggests strong recovery, potentially driven by operational improvements, restructuring, or the impact of the separation of the health technology business, which became a standalone public company in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNATURE OF BUSINESS - Abbott's principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.\n\nBASIS  OF  CONSOLIDATION  -  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES - The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  United  States  and  necessarily  include  amounts  based  on  estimates  and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales  rebates,  income  taxes,  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefits,  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net  assets  of  foreign  subsidiaries  whose  functional  currencies  are  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar  are  translated  into  U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of  these  subsidiaries  at  changing  rates  are  recorded  in  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment  account,  which  is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nREVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related  sales  are  recorded.  Sales  incentives  to  customers  are  not  material.  Historical  data  is  readily  available  and reliable,  and  is  used  for  estimating  the  amount  of  the  reduction  in  gross  sales.  Revenue  from  the  launch  of  a  new product,  from  an  improved  version  of  an  existing  product,  or  for  shipments  in  excess  of  a  customer's  normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve  for  such  revenue,  if  necessary.  In  certain  of  Abbott's  businesses,  primarily  within  diagnostics,  Abbott participates  in  selling  arrangements  that  include  multiple  performance  obligations  (e.g.,  instruments,  reagents, procedures,  and  service  agreements).  The  total  transaction  price  of  the  contract  is  allocated  to  each  performance obligation  in  an  amount  based  on  the  estimated  relative  standalone  selling  prices  of  the  promised  goods  or  services underlying each performance obligation. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights.\n\nINCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when  the  taxes  are  paid.  No  additional  income  taxes  have  been  provided  for  any  remaining  undistributed  foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Effective for fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  31,  2017,  the  TCJA  subjects  taxpayers  to  tax  on  global  intangible  low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GILTI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings.\n\nEARNINGS PER SHARE - Unvested restricted stock  units  and  awards  that  contain  non-forfeitable  rights  to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the twoclass  method.  Under  the  two-class  method,  net  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participating securities.  Earnings  from  Continuing  Operations  allocated  to  common  shares  in  2021,  2020  and  2019  were  $7.042 billion,  $4.449  billion  and  $3.666  billion,  respectively.  Net  earnings  allocated  to  common  shares  in  2021,  2020  and 2019 were $7.042 billion, $4.473 billion and $3.666 billion, respectively.\n\nPENSION AND  POST-EMPLOYMENT  BENEFITS  - Abbott  accrues  for  the  actuarially  determined  cost  of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop longterm assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return  on  plan  assets.  Differences  between  the  expected  long-term  return  on  plan  assets  and  the  actual  return  are amortized  over  a  five-year  period.  Actuarial  losses  and  gains  are  amortized  over  the  remaining  service  attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNATURE OF BUSINESS - Abbott's principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.\n\nBASIS OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES - The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States and necessarily include amounts based on estimates and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include  amounts  for  sales  rebates,  income  tax es,  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefits,  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  litigation,  derivative  financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net assets of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment account, which is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nREVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related sales are recorded. Sales incentives to customers are not material. Historical data is readily available and reliable, and is used for estimating the amount of the reduction in gross sales. Revenue from the launch of a new product, from an improved version of an existing product, or for shipments in excess of a customer's normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve for such revenue, if necessary. In certain Abbott businesses, primarily within diagnostics, Abbott participates in selling arrangements that include multiple performance obligations (e.g., instruments, reagents, procedures, and service agreements). The total transaction price of the contract is allocated to each performance obligation in an amount based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation.\n\nINCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when the taxes are paid. No additional income taxes have been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. The TCJA subjects taxpayers to tax on global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GIL TI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings.\n\nEARNINGS PER SHARE - Unvested restricted stock units and awards that contain non-forfeitable rights to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the two-class method. Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities. Net earnings allocated to common shares in 2024, 2023 and 2022 were $13.351 billion, $5.701 billion and $6.905 billion, respectively.\n\nPENSION AND POST-EMPLOYMENT BENEFITS - Abbott accrues for the actuarially determined cost of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop long-term assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return on plan assets. Differences between the expected long-term return on plan assets and the actual return are amortized over a five-year period. Actuarial losses and gains are amortized over the remaining service attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method.",

      "question": "What does Abbott's Diabetes Care revenue trajectory from 2022 to 2024 indicate about its market position and growth strategy?",
      "answer": "Abbott's Diabetes Care business demonstrated strong growth, with revenue increasing from $4.756 billion in 2022 to $5.761 billion in 2023, representing a 21.1% increase. The business maintained this elevated revenue level in 2024, indicating a successful strategic push into diabetes management technologies, likely driven by offerings like the FreeStyle Libre system mentioned in the 2022 filing. The consistent performance in 2023 and 2024 suggests Abbott solidified its market position after the significant growth year in 2023, pointing to a potential shift from expansion to stabilization in its diabetes care strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "Competition for nutritional products in the segment is generally from other diversified consumer and health care manufacturers. Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail  distribution,  and  availability  of  product  forms. A  significant  aspect  of  competition  is  the  search  for  ingredient innovations.  The  introduction  of  new  products  by  competitors,  changes  in  medical  practices  and  procedures,  and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure.\n\n## Medical Devices\n\nThese  products  include  a  broad  line  of  rhythm  management,  electrophysiology,  heart  failure,  vascular  and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally  marketed  and  sold  directly  to  wholesalers,  hospitals,  ambulatory  surgery  centers,  physicians'  offices,  and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses.

      "question": "How did Abbott's strategic positioning in Rapid Diagnostics evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of revenue trajectory, internal reorganization with the Heart Failure business, and shifting reliance on pandemic-driven demand?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Abbott's Rapid Diagnostics business underwent a significant transformation. In 2022, Rapid Diagnostics contributed $3,690 million in total revenue in 2023 (down from $10,061 million in 2022), showing a sharp decline, partly due to the winding down of pandemic-related demand for diagnostic tests, which had generated $8.4 billion in 2022. In 2023, the business was producing a wide range of diagnostic products, but the segment's revenue had already dropped significantly. In 2024, the company internally transferred the Acelis Connected Health business (which had contributed $115 million in 2022 sales) from Rapid Diagnostics to Heart Failure, signaling a strategic repositioning away from certain connected diagnostics offerings. By 2024, Rapid Diagnostics' revenue contribution had further declined to $747 million, largely reflecting the post-pandemic normalization. This evolution indicates a strategic pivot away from pandemic-driven growth and a reallocation of resources toward core or more stable business units like Heart Failure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: ABT(2022) \u2192 Rapid Diagnostics: Reports $10,061 million in revenue, driven by pandemic-related demand ($8.4 billion) and includes $115 million from the Acelis Connected Health business.",
        "Hop 2: ABT(2023) \u2192 Rapid Diagnostics: Revenue drops to $3,690 million, indicating a significant decline from 2022, with Acelis still part of the segment at the start of the year before being transferred.",
        "Hop 3: ABT(2024) \u2192 Rapid Diagnostics: Acelis business is formally moved to Heart Failure, and Rapid Diagnostics revenue further declines to $747 million, reflecting the end of pandemic-driven demand."

This downward trend continued in 2024, where revenue dropped further to $2,997 million, representing an additional 18.8% decline from 2023. The consistent decrease over the three-year period suggests a substantial contraction in the Rapid Diagnostics business, potentially due to market saturation, competitive pressures, or strategic shifts in focus by the company.",

This trajectory shows a volatile pattern, with a notable drop in 2023 followed by a strong rebound in 2024 that more than doubled the 2022 level. The sharp increase in 2024 suggests a major shift in financial performance or one-time gains, while the decline in 2023 may indicate operational challenges or strategic restructuring.",

          "chunk_text": "## Abbott Laboratories and Subsidiaries\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 - Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\nNATURE OF BUSINESS - Abbott's principal business is the discovery, development, manufacture and sale of a broad line of health care products.\n\nBASIS  OF  CONSOLIDATION  -  The  consolidated  financial  statements  include  the  accounts  of  the  parent company and subsidiaries, after elimination of intercompany transactions.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES - The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted  accounting  principles  in  the  United  States  and  necessarily  include  amounts  based  on  estimates  and assumptions by management. Actual results could differ from those amounts. Significant estimates include amounts for sales  rebates,  income  taxes,  pension  and  other  post-employment  benefits,  valuation  of  intangible  assets,  litigation, derivative financial instruments, and inventory and accounts receivable exposures.\n\nFOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION - The statements of earnings of foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates for the period. The net  assets  of  foreign  subsidiaries  whose  functional  currencies  are  other  than  the  U.S.  dollar  are  translated  into  U.S. dollars using exchange rates as of the balance sheet date. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating the net assets of  these  subsidiaries  at  changing  rates  are  recorded  in  the  foreign  currency  translation  adjustment  account,  which  is included in equity as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Transaction gains and losses are recorded on the Net foreign exchange (gain) loss line of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings.\n\nREVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue from product sales is recognized upon the transfer of control, which is generally upon shipment or delivery, depending on the delivery terms set forth in the customer contract. Provisions for discounts, rebates and sales incentives to customers, and returns and other adjustments are provided for in the period the related  sales  are  recorded.  Sales  incentives  to  customers  are  not  material.  Historical  data  is  readily  available  and reliable,  and  is  used  for  estimating  the  amount  of  the  reduction  in  gross  sales.  Revenue  from  the  launch  of  a  new product,  from  an  improved  version  of  an  existing  product,  or  for  shipments  in  excess  of  a  customer's  normal requirements are recorded when the conditions noted above are met. In those situations, management records a returns reserve  for  such  revenue,  if  necessary.  In  certain  of  Abbott's  businesses,  primarily  within  diagnostics,  Abbott participates  in  selling  arrangements  that  include  multiple  performance  obligations  (e.g.,  instruments,  reagents, procedures,  and  service  agreements).  The  total  transaction  price  of  the  contract  is  allocated  to  each  performance obligation  in  an  amount  based  on  the  estimated  relative  standalone  selling  prices  of  the  promised  goods  or  services underlying each performance obligation. Sales of product rights for marketable products are recorded as revenue upon disposition of the rights.\n\nINCOME TAXES - Deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate to be in effect when  the  taxes  are  paid.  No  additional  income  taxes  have  been  provided  for  any  remaining  undistributed  foreign earnings not subject to the transition tax related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), or any additional outside basis differences that exist, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Effective for fiscal  years  beginning  after  December  31,  2017,  the  TCJA  subjects  taxpayers  to  tax  on  global  intangible  low-taxed income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. Abbott treats the GILTI tax as a period expense and provides for the tax in the year that the tax is incurred. Interest and penalties on income tax obligations are included in taxes on earnings.\n\nEARNINGS PER SHARE - Unvested restricted stock  units  and  awards  that  contain  non-forfeitable  rights  to dividends are treated as participating securities and are included in the computation of earnings per share under the twoclass  method.  Under  the  two-class  method,  net  earnings  are  allocated  between  common  shares  and  participating securities.  Earnings  from  Continuing  Operations  allocated  to  common  shares  in  2021,  2020  and  2019  were  $7.042 billion,  $4.449  billion  and  $3.666  billion,  respectively.  Net  earnings  allocated  to  common  shares  in  2021,  2020  and 2019 were $7.042 billion, $4.473 billion and $3.666 billion, respectively.\n\nPENSION AND  POST-EMPLOYMENT  BENEFITS  - Abbott  accrues  for  the  actuarially  determined  cost  of pension and post-employment benefits over the service attribution periods of the employees. Abbott must develop longterm assumptions, the most significant of which are the health care cost trend rates, discount rates and the expected return  on  plan  assets.  Differences  between  the  expected  long-term  return  on  plan  assets  and  the  actual  return  are amortized  over  a  five-year  period.  Actuarial  losses  and  gains  are  amortized  over  the  remaining  service  attribution periods of the employees under the corridor method.",

By 2023, the Diabetes Care division reported a revenue of $5,761 million, reflecting a 21.1% increase compared to 2022's $4,756 million. This growth accelerated into 2024, where the Diabetes Care business maintained its momentum, showing continued revenue expansion.

Competitive factors include consumer advertising, formulation, packaging, scientific innovation, price, retail  distribution,  and  availability  of  product  forms. A  significant  aspect  of  competition  is  the  search  for  ingredient innovations.  The  introduction  of  new  products  by  competitors,  changes  in  medical  practices  and  procedures,  and regulatory changes can result in product obsolescence. In addition, private label and local manufacturers' products may increase competitive pressure.\n\n## Medical Devices\n\nThese  products  include  a  broad  line  of  rhythm  management,  electrophysiology,  heart  failure,  vascular  and structural heart devices for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, and diabetes care products for people with diabetes, as well as neuromodulation devices for the management of chronic pain and movement disorders. Medical devices are manufactured, marketed and sold worldwide. In the United States, depending upon the product, medical devices are generally  marketed  and  sold  directly  to  wholesalers,  hospitals,  ambulatory  surgery  centers,  physicians'  offices,  and distributors from Abbott-owned distribution centers and public warehouses.

      "question": "How did Abbott's Rapid Diagnostics segment revenue evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trajectory indicate about the company's broader diagnostics portfolio strategy, especially in light of the Acelis Connected Health business transfer and declining COVID-19 test sales?",
      "answer": "Abbott's Rapid Diagnostics revenue peaked at $10.061 billion in 2022, driven largely by $8.4 billion in pandemic-related COVID-19 testing sales. In 2023, the segment's revenue dropped sharply to $3.690 billion, with $115 million of sales further transferred to the Heart Failure division in early 2023 due to the Acelis Connected Health business move. By 2024, revenue remained low at $747 million in diagnostic testing sales, reflecting a continued decline in pandemic-driven demand. This three-year trajectory indicates a strategic shift away from rapid diagnostics as a growth engine toward more stable, connected health and core laboratory diagnostics offerings. The divestiture of Acelis functionality and the significant drop in sales suggest Abbott is recalibrating its diagnostics portfolio to focus on long-term, non-pandemic-dependent technologies and services.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Eli Lilly consistently identified payer reimbursement as a critical risk factor impacting the commercial success of its new product candidates. In 2022, the company highlighted that inability to obtain or maintain necessary payer reimbursement or coverage could lead to limited commercial success for promising products. In 2023, this risk was further emphasized, with the addition that payer reimbursement uncertainties could result in excess inventory and related financial charges due to unpredictable demand. By 2024, the company explicitly stated its dependence on obtaining and maintaining payer reimbursement, framing it as a core prerequisite for commercial success and tying it directly to revenue growth and inventory planning. This progression shows an increasing strategic focus on payer reimbursement as a determinant of financial outcomes, reflecting the growing complexity and cost of drug development and commercialization.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in ev aluating our company. It is possible that our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects could be materially adv ersely affected by any of these risks. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believ e to be immaterial could also adv ersely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, results of operations, reputation, and prospects.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\n- Pharmaceutical research and development is very costly and highly uncertain; we may not succeed in developing, licensing, or acquiring commercially successful products sufficient in number or value to replace revenues of products that have lost or will lose intellectual property protection or are displaced by competing products or therapies.\n\nThere are many difficulties and uncertainties inherent in pharmaceutical research and dev elopment, the introduction of new products and indications, business development activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, and commercialization of our products.\n\nThere is a high rate of failure inherent in drug discov ery and dev elopment. To bring a product from the discov ery phase to market takes considerable time and entails significant cost. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial inv estment and following meaningful cost for manufacturing capabilities and inv entory to prepare for launch. As a result, a significant portion of funds inv ested in research and development programs will not generate direct financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in dev elopment or prior to being acquired may fail to reach the market or may hav e only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approv als or payer reimbursement or cov erage, failure to obtain placement on guidelines or recommendations published by third-party organizations that are commensurate with clinical data, the application of pricing controls, limited scope of approv ed uses, label changes, changes in the relev ant treatment standards or the av ailability of newer, better, or more cost-effectiv e competitiv e products, difficulty or excessiv e costs to manufacture, insufficient infrastructure to support detection, diagnostic or other requisites for treatment, ineffectiv eness in connecting with healthcare professionals, including digitally through v irtual engagements, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. We may also fail to allocate research and dev elopment resources efficiently, fail to pursue or inv est sufficiently in product candidates or indications that may hav e been successful, or fail to optimally balance trial design, conduct, and speed to accomplish desired outcomes.\n\nRegulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delay, uncertainty, unpredictability, and inconsistency in drug approv al processes across markets and agencies can result in delays in product launches, lost market opportunities, impairment of inv entories, and other negativ e impacts. In addition, it can be v ery difficult to predict rev enue growth rates of, or v ariability in demand for, new or future products and indications, which in some cases leads to difficulty meeting product demand or, on the other hand, lower v olume growth, excess inv entory and related financial charges.\n\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products and indications now under dev elopment will be approv ed or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approv al will be maintained; whether we will be able to dev elop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates, indications, or products; or whether our products and indications, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nThrough internal innov ation and business dev elopment we must maintain a flow of successful products and indications or line extensions sufficient both to cov er our substantial research and dev elopment costs and inv estments and to replace rev enues that are lost as profitable products become subject to pricing controls, lose intellectual property exclusiv ity, or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to timely replenish our product portfolio and pipeline would hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Our dependence on, or focus in, one or more key products or product classes exacerbates this risk. In addition, the growth of our business and rev enue base increases the risk that products dev eloped or acquired by us may not prov ide adequate v alue to sustain further long-term growth.\n\nWe engage in various forms of business dev elopment activ ities to enhance or refine our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, codevelopment agreements, co-promotion arrangements, distribution",

To bring a drug from the discovery phase to market can take over a decade and often costs in excess of $2 billion. Failure can occur at any point in the process, including in later stages after substantial investment. As a result, most funds invested in research programs will not generate financial returns. New product candidates that appear promising in development may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals or payer reimbursement or coverage, limited scope of approved uses, label changes, changes in the relevant treatment standards or the availability of new or better competitive products, difficulty or excessive costs to manufacture, or infringement of the patents or intellectual property rights of others. Regulatory agencies establish high hurdles for the efficacy and safety of new products and indications. Delays and uncertainties in drug approval processes can result in delays in product launches and lost market opportunity. In addition, it can be very difficult to predict revenue growth rates of new products and indications.\n\nWe cannot state with certainty when or whether our products now under development will be approved or launched; whether, if initially granted, such approval will be maintained; whether we will be able to develop, license, or otherwise acquire additional product candidates or products; or whether our products, once launched, will be commercially successful.\n\nWe must maintain a continuous flow of successful new products and successful new indications or brand extensions for existing products, both through our internal efforts and our business development activities, sufficient both to cover our substantial research and development costs and to replace revenues that are lost as profitable products lose intellectual property exclusivity or are displaced by competing products or therapies. Failure to do so in the short-term or long-term would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\n\nWe engage in various forms of business development activities to enhance our product pipeline, including licensing arrangements, co-development agreements, co-promotion arrangements, joint ventures, acquisitions, and equity investments. There are substantial risks associated with identifying successful business development targets and consummating related transactions. Increased focus on business combinations in our industry, including by the Federal Trade Commission, and heightened competition for attractive targets has and could continue to delay, jeopardize or increase the costs of our business development activities. In addition, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or the operations of the businesses, products, or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution, and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the expected benefits of business development transactions and may result in our incurrence of substantial asset impairment or restructuring charges. We also may fail to generate the expected revenue and pipeline enhancement from business development activities due to developments outside our control, including unsuccessful clinical trials, issues related to the quality, integrity, or broad applicability of data, regulatory impediments, and commercialization challenges. Accordingly, business development transactions may not be completed in a timely manner (if at all), may not result in successful commercialization of any product, and may give rise to legal proceedings or regulatory scrutiny.\n\nSee Item 1, \"Business - Research and Development - Phases of New Drug Development\" and Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis - Results of Operations - Executive Overview - Late-Stage Pipeline,\" for more details about our current product pipeline.",

This downward trend suggests improved forecasting and inventory management practices, particularly given the company's ongoing efforts to monitor wholesaler inventory levels and limited visibility into retail channel inventories.

This estimate is based on sev eral factors, including: historical return rates, expiration date by product (on av erage, approximately 24 months after the initial sale of a product to our customer), and estimated lev els of inv entory in the wholesale and retail channels, as well as any other specifically identified anticipated returns due to known factors such as the loss of patent exclusiv ity, product recalls and discontinuations, or a changing competitiv e env ironment. We maintain a returns policy that allows most U.S. customers to return most of our products for dating issues within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the product's expiration date. Following the loss of exclusiv ity for a patent-dependent product, we expect to experience an elev ated lev el of product returns as product inv entory remaining in the wholesale and retail channels expires. Adjustments to the returns reserv e hav e been and may in the future be required based on rev ised estimates to our assumptions. We record the return amounts as a deduction to arriv e at our net product rev enue. Once the product is returned, it is destroyed; we do not record a right of return asset. Our returns policies outside the U.S. are generally more restrictiv e than in the U.S. as returns are not allowed for reasons other than failure to meet product specifications in many countries. Our reserv e for future product returns for product sales outside the U.S. is not material.\n- As a part of our process to estimate a reserv e for product returns, we regularly rev iew the supply lev els of our significant products at the major wholesalers in the U.S. and in major markets outside the U.S., primarily by rev iewing periodic inv entory reports supplied by our major wholesalers and av ailable prescription v olume information for our products, or alternativ e approaches. We attempt to maintain U.S. wholesaler inv entory lev els at an av erage of approximately one month or less. Causes of unusual wholesaler buying patterns include actual or anticipated product-supply issues, weather patterns, anticipated changes in the transportation network, redundant holiday stocking, and changes in wholesaler business operations. In the U.S., the current structure of our arrangements prov ides us with data on inv entory lev els at our wholesalers; howev er, our data on inv entory lev els in the retail channel is more limited. Wholesaler stocking and destocking activ ity historically has not caused any material changes in the rate of actual product returns.\n- Actual U.S. product returns hav e been less than 1 percent of our U.S. rev enue during each of the past three years and hav e not fluctuated significantly as a percentage of rev enue, although fluctuations are more likely in periods following loss of patent exclusiv ity for major products in the U.S. market.\n\n## Adjustments to Revenue\n\nAdjustments to rev enue recognized as a result of changes in estimates for our most significant U.S. sales returns, rebates, and discounts liability balances for products shipped in prev ious periods were less than 3 percent of U.S. rev enue during the year ended December 31, 2024, and less than 1 percent of U.S. rev enue during each of the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Collaboration and Other Arrangements\n\nWe recognize several types of rev enue from our collaborations and other arrangements, which we discuss in general terms immediately below and more specifically in Note 4 for each of our significant collaborations and other arrangements. Our collaborations and other arrangements are ev aluated to determine if the arrangements in their entirety, or contain aspects that, are contracts with customers.\n\n- Revenue related to products we sell pursuant to these arrangements is included in net product rev enue at the earlier of when control of the asset transfers to the other party or when the product has no alternativ e use to us and we hav e right to payment.\n- Profit-sharing due from our collaboration partners, which is based upon gross margins reported to us by our partners, is recognized as collaboration and other rev enue as earned.\n- Royalty rev enue from licensees and certain of our collaboration partners, which is based on sales to third parties of licensed products and technology, is recorded when the third-party sale occurs and the performance obligation to which some or all of the royalty has been allocated has been satisfied (or partially satisfied).

Such adjustments for products shipped in previous periods resulted in approximately 2 percent or less increase to U.S revenue during each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\n\n## Collaboration and Other Arrangements\n\nWe recognize several types of revenue from our collaborations and other arrangements, which we discuss in general terms immediately below and more specifically in Note 4 for each of our material collaborations and other arrangements. Our collaborations and other arrangements are not contracts with customers but are evaluated to determine whether any aspects of the arrangements are contracts with customers.\n\n- Revenue related to products we sell pursuant to these arrangements is included in net product revenue, while other sources of revenue (e.g., royalties and profit sharing from our partner) are included in collaboration and other revenue.\n- Initial fees and developmental milestones we receive in collaborative and other similar arrangements from the partnering of our compounds under development are generally deferred and amortized into income through the expected product approval date.\n- Profit-sharing due from our collaboration partners, which is based upon gross margins reported to us by our partners, is recognized as collaboration and other revenue as earned.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LLY's tax provision included the impact of the Puerto Rico Excise Tax, GILTI tax, and other U.S. taxation of foreign income. In 2023, the company again cited the impact of GILTI tax, Puerto Rico Excise Tax (for 2022 and 2021), and other U.S. taxation of foreign income. By 2024, the Puerto Rico Excise Tax was only referenced for 2022, while GILTI tax and other U.S. taxation of foreign income remained as continuing factors. This indicates that while the Puerto Rico Excise Tax's influence on tax provisions was phased out after 2023, the GILTI tax and broader U.S. foreign income taxation remained a consistent and ongoing component of LLY's international tax exposure.",
