By 2024, the Other Segment reported an operating profit of $505 million, indicating a significant turnaround. This shift shows that the segment evolved from being a cost center with restructuring burdens to a contributor to overall profitability, suggesting improved performance or strategic realignment.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

      "answer": "In 2022, QCOM's Equipment and Services segment reported an EBT of -$279 million, a sharp decline from $916 million in 2021, indicating substantial underperformance. This segment negatively impacted the overall EBT pool, which included QTL's contribution of $4,628 million in EBT during the same year. By 2024, QTL remained a core strategic business unit, continuing to generate strong licensing revenue and profitability, suggesting it likely maintained or improved its EBT contribution despite challenges elsewhere. The contrast between QTL's consistent financial strength and the Equipment and Services segment's deterioration highlights QTL's critical role in stabilizing QCOM's overall earnings during a period of segmental imbalance.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

By 2024, Intel's stake in Intel Foundry Services had shifted to a fully transferred and impaired position, with a $222 million transfer and subsequent impairment recorded under the segment. This indicates a strategic pivot where Intel restructured its involvement in the foundry business, moving away from direct operational ownership, likely to reduce losses and refocus resources on core competencies.

By 2024, this treatment remained consistent, with environmental costs still being reported within Other alongside other corporate-level expenses such as litigation and restructuring charges. However, in 2024, the Other segment generated $947 million in revenue, suggesting that while the segment's overall scale increased, the company maintained its approach of isolating environmental costs from segment-level performance metrics. This indicates a stable policy in how TXN manages and reports environmental expenses, treating them as non-operational corporate costs rather than integrating them into core segment evaluations.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, AVGO allocated $526 million of the purchase consideration from its acquisition of the Lehi, Utah semiconductor factory specifically to machinery and equipment. This represented a significant portion of the total $893 million acquisition cost. By 2023, AVGO's financial statements disclosed that the company's total machinery and equipment value had increased to $4,739 million, up from the 2022 acquisition value. This indicates that AVGO not only retained the acquired machinery and equipment but also expanded its investment in this asset class over the following year, suggesting a strategic focus on enhancing manufacturing capabilities and asset utilization.",

We use the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment.\n\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-ofuse ('ROU') assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months, and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. ROU assets represent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for the effects of collateral. Operating and finance lease ROU assets are recognized net of any lease prepayments and incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized based on the effectiveinterest method over the lease term.\n\nFair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\n\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurements are described below:\n\nLevel 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents, banker's acceptances, trading securities investments and investment funds. We measure trading securities investments and investment funds at quoted market prices as they are traded in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.\n\nLevel 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired. Quantitative information for Level 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each reporting period includes indicators of significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the investee, and financial indicators of the investee's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nBusiness combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets under the income approach include growth in future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period, technology obsolescence rates, expected costs to develop in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Intel reported $172 million in Marketing, General, and Administrative (MG&A) expenses related to customer relationships and brands, with no mention of Internal-Use Software in this category. By 2024, Internal-Use Software was introduced into MG&A with $24 million in amortization expenses, while customer relationships and brands dropped to $165 million. Despite this new inclusion, total amortization expenses decreased from $1,755 million in 2023 to $1,428 million in 2024, indicating that the addition of Internal-Use Software did not offset reductions in other amortization categories. This reflects a strategic shift or cost optimization in how Intel is managing its intangible assets and associated expenses over time.",

      "question": "How did Intel's management of obsolete inventory in 2022 impact gross margins, and how did this relationship evolve in 2023 given changes in manufacturing planning and asset depreciation estimates?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Intel disclosed that overestimating demand for new products led to excess and obsolete inventory write-offs, which directly reduced gross margins. This negative impact was evident when manufacturing output was not aligned with actual demand, especially for products with short lifecycles. In 2023, Intel adjusted its manufacturing planning by increasing the estimated useful lives of certain machinery and equipment from 5 to 8 years, which likely improved asset efficiency and reduced depreciation costs. These changes may have helped mitigate inventory-related margin pressures by aligning production more closely with demand forecasts, potentially stabilizing or improving gross margins despite ongoing inventory valuation challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: INTC(2022) \u2192 Obsolete Inventory: Intel disclosed in 2022 that excess and obsolete inventory write-offs occurred when demand forecasts exceeded actual demand, particularly for new products with limited historical data.",
        "Hop 2: Obsolete Inventory \u2192 Gross Margins: Excess inventory write-downs directly reduced gross margins, as noted in the AMD filing, which described how inventory misalignment can lead to margin compression.",
        "Hop 3: Gross Margins \u2190 INTC(2023): In 2023, Intel revised the useful lives of certain manufacturing equipment from 5 to 8 years, which could have reduced depreciation costs and improved gross margin resilience against inventory-related losses."

          "chunk_text": "The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.\n\nAssets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use nonbinding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Debt Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nMarketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n78",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

If enacted, these proposals would materially increase the level of income tax on our international profits.\n\nOur future income tax provisions and effective tax rate could materially increase if any of the foregoing potential tax changes are implemented or if other changes are made to applicable tax laws and rules in the U.S. or in other countries in which we do business. Our provision for income taxes also could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of income earned or losses incurred in jurisdictions  with  differing  statutory  tax  rates,  fluctuations  in  our  stock  price  and  level  of  stock-based  compensation  expense, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities and by other factors.\n\nOur international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results. We derive a substantial portion of our revenues from, and have significant operations, outside of the U.S. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. These laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, foreign currency-related regulations, competition regulations, anti-bribery laws and other laws prohibiting payments to governmental officials such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), market access regulations, tariffs, and import, export and general trade regulations, including but not limited to economic sanctions and embargos. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions on the conduct of our business, including the loss of trade privileges.  Any  such  violations  could  result  in  prohibitions  on  our  ability  to  offer  our  products  and  services  in  one  or  more countries,  could  delay  or  prevent  potential  acquisitions  and  could  also  materially  damage  our  reputation,  our  brand,  our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. These laws can require  suspension  or  termination  of  business,  including  financial  transactions,  in  certain  countries,  territories  or  with  certain customers and any such action in the future could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example,  in  response  to  the  current  Russia-Ukraine  conflict,  the  U.S.  and  other  countries  have  announced  extensive  sanctions against Russia and could impose broader sanctions or take other actions should the conflict further escalate. Oracle withdrew its operations from the Russian Federation and the Republic of Belarus in March 2022. Oracle recorded fiscal 2022 revenues of $248 million from these two countries, a reduction of $118 million relative to fiscal 2021. No revenues are expected to be recognized from these two countries prospectively. Compliance with these laws also requires a significant amount of management attention and effort, which may divert management's attention from running our business operations and could harm our ability to grow our business, or may increase our expenses as we engage specialized or other additional resources to assist us with our compliance efforts.\n\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties.

      "answer": "In 2023, Intel reported an operating income of $664 million from its Mobileye segment, reflecting its ongoing investment and operational profitability in autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS). This segment had consistently contributed positively to Intel\u2019s earnings, with operating income of $690 million in 2022 and $554 million in 2021. By the end of 2024, Intel maintained a total stake in Mobileye valued at $10.919 billion, indicating no divestiture or reduction in ownership despite broader restructuring efforts. The sustained stake suggests that Intel viewed Mobileye as a strategic asset, likely due to its strong operating performance and growth potential in the automotive technology sector. This evolution from a profitable segment in 2023 to a significant retained stake in 2024 reveals Intel\u2019s intent to maintain a foothold in the autonomous driving ecosystem despite challenges in other business areas.",

      "question": "How did the changes in asset allocation for ACN's Non-U.S. Plans in 2022 impact the company's pension expense in 2023, particularly in relation to the expected long-term rate of return on assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ACN's Non-U.S. Plans saw an increase in allocation to equity securities from 21% to 27%, while debt securities decreased from 50% to 48%. This shift in asset allocation likely influenced the pension expense dynamics in 2023. Specifically, a sensitivity analysis showed that a \u00b125 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return on assets affected Non-U.S. Plans by \u00b1$325 in 2022. Given that ACN's total pension expense increased from $188,001 in 2022 to $206,346 in 2023, the altered investment strategy appears to have contributed to this upward trend in pension costs.",

This aligns with the reported 9% increase in QCT revenues, driven by higher handset and automotive revenues, despite lower IoT performance.

      "answer": "In 2022, AVGO reported an expected term of 3.4 years for stock awards, during a period of 37.1% volatility and a 1.4% risk-free interest rate. By 2024, the expected term increased slightly to 3.6 years, while volatility decreased to 32.0% and the risk-free interest rate rose sharply to 4.2%. The decrease in volatility suggests more stable stock price movements, which may have supported a longer expected term despite higher interest rates. This indicates a potential strategic shift toward encouraging longer holding periods for equity awards, possibly to align with longer-term performance goals or to stabilize employee retention incentives amid changing macroeconomic conditions.",

By 2024, despite an increase in risk-free interest rates from 1.4% to 4.2%, and a drop in dividend yield from 2.7% to 1.7%, the expected term increased slightly to 3.6 years. This suggests AVGO maintained or adjusted its assumptions about employee exercise behavior despite higher market volatility in 2024 compared to 2022.

By fiscal 2023, North America revenues saw a slight 2% increase overall, but the Banking & Capital Markets segment experienced a decline, which was noted as one of the contributors to the modest growth. In fiscal 2024, Accenture continued to operate in the Banking & Capital Markets segment, which includes clients such as retail and commercial banks, payment providers, and investment banks. The decline in this segment likely offset some of the gains from other areas like Public Service and Industrial, suggesting a weakening demand or reduced spending from financial institutions during that period, even as overall North America performance slightly improved.",

This acquisition directly contributed to the growth in the 'Buildings and improvements' line item, which increased from $5,880 million in 2023 to $6,493 million in 2024, representing a $613 million increase year-over-year. The 2022 acquisition provided a foundational addition to Oracle\u2019s real estate portfolio, which continued to grow in 2023 and into 2024, likely due to both carryover investment and additional capital expenditures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Index to Financial Statements\n\nMany  of  our  customer  contracts  include  multiple  performance  obligations.  Judgment  is  required  in  determining  whether  each performance obligation within a customer contract is distinct. Oracle products and services generally function on a standalone basis and  do  not  require  a  significant  amount  of  integration  or  interdependency.  Therefore,  multiple  products  and  services  contained within  a  customer  contract  are  generally  considered  to  be  distinct  and  are  not  combined  for  revenue  recognition  purposes.  We allocate  the  transaction  price  for  each  customer  contract  to  each  performance  obligation  based  on  the  relative  SSP  (the determination  of  SSP  is  discussed  below)  for  each  performance  obligation  within  each  contract.  We  recognize  the  amount  of transaction price allocated to each performance obligation within a customer contract as revenue as each performance obligation is satisfied.\n\nWe use historical sales transaction data and judgment, among other factors, in determining the SSP for products and services. For substantially all performance obligations except cloud licenses and on-premise licenses, we are able to establish the SSP based on the  observable  prices  of  products  or  services  sold  separately  in  comparable  circumstances  to  similar  customers.  We  typically establish  an  SSP  range  for  our  products  and  services,  which  is  reassessed  on  a  periodic  basis  or  when  facts  and  circumstances change. SSP for our products and services can evolve over time due to changes in our pricing practices that are influenced by intense competition, changes in demand for our products and services, and economic factors, among others. Our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses have not historically been sold on a standalone basis, as substantially all customers elect to purchase license support contracts at the time of a license purchase. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase the license. We are unable to establish the SSP for our cloud licenses and on-premise licenses based  on  observable  prices  given  the  same  products  are  sold  for  a  broad  range  of  amounts  (that  is,  the  selling  price  is  highly variable) and a representative SSP is not discernible from past transactions or other observable evidence. As a result, the SSP for a cloud license and an on-premise license included in a contract with multiple performance obligations is generally determined by applying  a  residual  approach  whereby  all  other  performance  obligations  within  a  contract  are  first  allocated  a  portion  of  the transaction price based upon their respective SSPs, with any residual amount of transaction price allocated to cloud license and onpremise license revenues.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated  set  of  assets  and  activities  that  is  capable  of  being  conducted  and  managed  for  the  purpose  of  providing  a  return  to investors.  Asset  acquisitions  are  accounted  for  by  allocating  the  cost  of  the  acquisition  to  the  individual  assets  and  liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  with  the  corresponding  offset  to  goodwill.  Upon  the  conclusion  of  a  business acquisition's measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations.\n\nAccounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition  date,  including  our  estimates  for  intangible  assets,  pre-acquisition  contingencies  and  any  contingent  consideration, where applicable. Although we believe that the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate,  they  are  based  in  part  on  historical  experience  and  information  obtained  from  the  management  of  the  acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Broadcom disclosed an expected stock option term of 4.8 years, which was commensurate with the awards' contractual terms, and used a volatility of 32.8% and a dividend yield of 3.3% in its valuation model. By fiscal 2024, the expected term had decreased to 3.6 years, with volatility slightly reduced to 32.0% and dividend yield dropping significantly to 1.7%. The reduction in expected term suggests a shift in employee exercise behavior or a change in award structure, which would lower the fair value of options granted.

      "answer": "In 2023, ACN's Banking & Capital Markets segment was a key contributor to the company's overall industry group performance, with significant revenue influence across multiple geographic markets. By 2024, the segment directly contributed to a 7% local currency revenue increase in Growth Markets, as noted in the revenue commentary. This growth was driven by performance in Japan and Argentina, despite declines in Australia and Brazil. The Banking & Capital Markets segment\u2019s role in this growth occurred alongside structural changes: in fiscal 2024, the Middle East and Africa were moved out of Growth Markets into EMEA, which redefined the composition and geographic focus of Growth Markets. Thus, the segment\u2019s performance in the remaining markets (primarily Asia Pacific and Latin America) became more concentrated and impactful in driving Growth Markets' revenue growth.",

Revenue growth was driven by the United States.\n- EMEA revenues were flat in local currency, as growth in Public Service was offset by declines in Communications &amp; M edia and Banking &amp; Capital M arkets. Revenues were driven by an increase in Italy, offset by declines in France and the United Kingdom.\n- Growth Markets revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by growth in Banking &amp; Capital M arkets, Industrial and Chemicals &amp; Natural Resources. Revenue growth was driven by Japan and Argentina, partially offset by declines in A ustralia and Brazil. A rgentina revenues grew in local currency due primarily to hyperinflation.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal 2024 decreased $1 million from fiscal 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.2% from 86.3% during this period.\n\nThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs such as facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities;",

      "question": "How did the decline in Intel's (INTC) Total Operating Income from 2023 to 2024 correlate with its strategic positioning in the Network and Edge segment, especially considering the segment's unchanged capital allocation in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Intel's Total Operating Income dropped significantly to $93 million from $2,334 million in 2022, reflecting across-the-board profitability issues, including a $1,515 million loss in the Network and Edge segment compared to a $1,033 million profit the prior year. Despite this, Intel maintained its capital allocation in the Network and Edge segment, holding its net assets steady at $2,809 million in 2024. This suggests that Intel continued to prioritize the Network and Edge segment strategically, even as the broader company experienced deteriorating operating income, potentially signaling a long-term bet on this business unit amid overall financial strain.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft expressed concerns that competitive pressures could lead to price reductions, which would negatively impact gross margins and operating income. This concern was grounded in the broader context of transitioning to cloud-based services while facing pricing pressures from competitors offering free or low-cost alternatives. Evidence from Amazon in 2021 showed that price reductions could positively impact unit sales, suggesting a potential offsetting mechanism for margin pressure through volume growth. However, in 2024, Microsoft again highlighted that competitive pricing and increased infrastructure costs for cloud and AI services were adversely affecting their financial condition and results of operations. Despite potential increases in unit sales through pricing strategies, the persistent margin pressures from both price reductions and rising infrastructure costs suggest that the anticipated volume-driven compensation did not fully materialize or offset the financial impact in 2024.",

We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n- Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling thirdparty advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n- Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of  research  and  development  for  the  open  source  software.  Some  open  source  software  mimics  the  features  and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\n\nOur increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building  best-in-class  platforms  and  productivity  services  for  an  intelligent  cloud  and  an  intelligent  edge  infused  with  artificial intelligence ('AI'). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in  the  cloud  and  sometimes  the  user's  choice  of  which  cloud-based  services  to  use.  We  are  devoting  significant  resources  to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things ('IoT'). Our success in the IoT will depend on the  level  of  adoption  of  our  offerings  such  as Azure, Azure  Stack, Azure  IoT  Edge,  and Azure  Sphere.  We  may  not  establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives.\n\nBesides  software  development  costs,  we  are  incurring  costs  to  build  and  maintain  infrastructure  to  support  cloud  computing services.  These  costs  will  reduce  the  operating  margins  we  have  previously  achieved.  Whether  we  succeed  in  cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:\n\n- Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.\n- Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints.\n- Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\n- Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n- Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above.

The  expenses  include stock-based  compensation  expense,  corporate  infrastructure  and  support  costs,  acquisition-related  costs,  IP-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\n\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue.

T he decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.\n\n## Restructuring Charges\n\nWe recognized $186 million of restructuring charges in 2024 due to the implementation of a restructuring plan (the 2024 Restructuring Plan). The 2024 Restructuring Plan was focused on driv ing efficiencies across the business and aligning resources with our largest growth opportunities in the AI and enterprise markets.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nWe hold equity interests in two joint v entures (collectiv ely, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information T echnology Co., Ltd.

      "answer": "In 2023, TXN's Other Segment was not explicitly broken out in the Cost of Revenue (COR) reporting, but in 2024, it contributed $363 million to the total COR of $6,547 million. This indicates that the Other Segment maintained a minor role in the overall cost structure, representing just 5.5% of total COR in 2024. The segment's relatively small contribution to COR, despite a slight increase in absolute terms, suggests it remained operationally lean compared to the larger Analog and Embedded Processing segments, which accounted for the majority of both revenue and cost.",

        "Hop 2: Other Segment \u2192 Cost of Revenue: In 2024, the Other Segment's Cost of Revenue is explicitly quantified at $363 million, contributing to the total COR of $6,547 million.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft's increasing focus on cloud-based services led to significant infrastructure investments, which reduced operating margins and placed downward pressure on gross margins. These investments were tied to scaling Azure and other cloud offerings, including datacenter expansion and increased server capacity. By 2023, the company faced rising component shortages and supply chain disruptions, particularly in datacenter servers and hardware devices like Surface and Xbox, which led to increased risks of excess or obsolete inventory. The combination of earlier margin compression from cloud investments and later inventory write-down risks due to supply constraints created a compounded financial challenge, affecting both cost of revenue and inventory valuation. This shows a clear temporal evolution where earlier strategic investments in cloud infrastructure created operational dependencies that later exposed the company to greater inventory and supply chain volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1A\n\n## Business model competition\n\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\n\n- Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n- Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling thirdparty advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n- Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of  research  and  development  for  the  open  source  software.  Some  open  source  software  mimics  the  features  and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\n\nOur increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building  best-in-class  platforms  and  productivity  services  for  an  intelligent  cloud  and  an  intelligent  edge  infused  with  artificial intelligence ('AI'). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in  the  cloud  and  sometimes  the  user's  choice  of  which  cloud-based  services  to  use.  We  are  devoting  significant  resources  to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things ('IoT'). Our success in the IoT will depend on the  level  of  adoption  of  our  offerings  such  as Azure, Azure  Stack, Azure  IoT  Edge,  and Azure  Sphere.  We  may  not  establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives.\n\nBesides  software  development  costs,  we  are  incurring  costs  to  build  and  maintain  infrastructure  to  support  cloud  computing services.  These  costs  will  reduce  the  operating  margins  we  have  previously  achieved.  Whether  we  succeed  in  cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:\n\n- Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.\n- Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints.\n- Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\n- Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n- Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.",

          "chunk_text": "We  often  partner  with  third-party  providers  for  certain  worker  services  and  we  may  provide  certain  limited  worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

      "answer": "In 2022, QTL licensing revenues increased by $308 million due to favorable product mix, primarily from 5G adoption. However, this was partially offset by a $299 million decrease in estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products. Despite this revenue growth, QTL\u2019s proportion to QCT revenues declined, negatively impacting the gross margin. This decline in high-margin QTL licensing revenue proportion was a drag on gross margin in 2022. In 2023, the gross margin remained flat year-over-year, suggesting that other factors, such as improvements in QCT gross margin, offset the negative impact from the declining share of QTL licensing revenues.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel guided toward gross margins of 51-53% over the next several years, influenced by increased manufacturing investments and process technology acceleration. This guidance likely supported more aggressive production planning, increasing the risk of excess inventory when actual demand fell short. In 2023, Intel disclosed that excess inventory write-offs occurred when demand forecasts exceeded actual demand and manufacturing output wasn't adjusted accordingly. The 2022 margin expectations, tied to scaling and investment, appear to have indirectly contributed to inventory overruns in 2023 when market demand did not meet projections.",

We experienced strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market segments. DCG was down on lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform  volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment. IOTG and Mobileye both achieved strong results on higher demand amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. We invested $15.2 billion in R&amp;D, made capital investments of $18.7 billion, and generated $30.0 billion in cash from operations and $11.3 billion of free cash flow. 1\n\n\"We achieved solid results amid a highly constrained industry-wide supply environment while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position.

We believe these investments will position us for accelerating long-term revenue growth. We expect our long-term revenue outlook to accelerate to a 10% to 12% year-over-year growth rate by the end of our five-year horizon as supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products. We expect gross margins to be impacted by our investments in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, resulting in expected non-GAAP gross margins percentages between 51% and 53%  over the next several years before moving upward. We also expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. We expect our cash from operations to be strong, but our capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term. 2\n\n- See \"Our Products\" within MD&amp;A. 1\n- See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&amp;A. 2",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, ACN\u2019s Growth Markets segment reported operating income of $1,953 million, with a 16% operating margin, and its growth was partially offset by lower contract profitability. By fiscal 2023, the company noted continued pressure on contract profitability due to compensation increases, which it attempted to mitigate through pricing adjustments and delivery efficiencies. Despite these efforts, the persistent negative impact of lower contract profitability suggests that the Growth Markets segment likely experienced a moderation in operating margin expansion or a slower growth trajectory in 2023 compared to 2022.",

During fiscal 2022, Other income (expense) decreased $238 million from fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments.

Our contribution  expense  for  fiscal  years  2022,  2021,  and  2020  was  $168  million,  $120  million,  and  $76  million, respectively.\n\n## Note 17 - Segment Information\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information  presented  on  an  operating  segment  basis  for  purposes  of  making  decisions  and  assessing  financial performance.\n\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related  infrastructure,  and  solutions  for  gaming  platforms;  Quadro/NVIDIA  RTX  GPUs  for  enterprise  workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds.\n\nOur  Compute  &amp;  Networking  segment  includes  Data  Center  platforms  and  systems  for  AI,  HPC,  and  accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; CMP; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software.\n\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.\n\nThe  'All  Other'  category  includes  the  expenses  that  our  CODM  does  not  assign  to  either  Graphics  or  Compute  &amp; Networking  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions  or  assessing  financial  performance.  The  expenses  include stock-based  compensation  expense,  corporate  infrastructure  and  support  costs,  acquisition-related  costs,  IP-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\n\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the 'All Other' category.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, AMD reported a $12 million licensing gain, which was a minor credit within its financials. By 2024, this licensing gain became part of the 'All Other' category\u2014a residual segment that also included significant expenses such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation, acquisition-related and other costs (including transaction costs, purchase price adjustments, and workforce rebalancing charges), and restructuring charges. While the licensing gain in 2022 was relatively small, its inclusion in the 'All Other' category by 2024 highlights how IP monetization efforts were being used to offset larger strategic costs tied to acquisitions and restructuring, reflecting a broader financial strategy to align resources with long-term growth initiatives.",

By fiscal 2024, the expected term had decreased to 3.6 years, aligning with a lower volatility of 32.0% and a significantly reduced dividend yield of 1.7%.

      "question": "How did Intel's excess inventory write-downs in 2022 impact gross margins, and how did this compare to the gross margin performance in 2023 following adjustments in manufacturing output strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Intel wrote off significant amounts of excess inventory due to demand forecast inaccuracies, which negatively impacted gross margins. This issue was compounded by overproduction and a mismatch between supply and demand, particularly in markets with short product lifecycles. In 2023, Intel adjusted its manufacturing output strategies and demand forecasting methods, which led to improved gross margin performance. Additionally, in early 2023, Intel extended the useful life estimates of certain manufacturing equipment from 5 to 8 years, indirectly supporting margin improvements by reducing depreciation expenses.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: INTC(2022) \u2192 Excess Inventory: Intel acknowledged writing off excess inventory in 2022 due to demand forecast overestimation and failure to reduce manufacturing output accordingly.",
        "Hop 2: Excess Inventory \u2192 Gross Margins: AMD\u2019s 2022 filing (used as proxy evidence) showed that excess inventory write-downs directly reduce gross margins due to unsellable or obsolete stock.",
        "Hop 3: Gross Margins \u2190 INTC(2023): In 2023, Intel updated its manufacturing planning and extended the useful life of key equipment, which helped stabilize and improve gross margins."

          "chunk_text": "The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.\n\nAssets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use nonbinding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Debt Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nMarketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n78",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

      "question": "How did the revenue contribution from the Communications, Media & Technology segment change as a percentage of ACN's total FY24 revenues compared to its 2022 performance, and what might this indicate about the segment's strategic positioning?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ACN's Communications, Media & Technology segment generated $12.2B in revenue, contributing approximately 19.8% to the company's total revenue of $61.6B. By FY24, this segment's revenue decreased to $10.8B, now accounting for 16.9% of ACN's total FY24 revenue of $64.0B (sum of all group revenues: $10.8B + $11.6B + $13.8B + $13.8B + $14.0B). This decline in both absolute revenue and percentage contribution suggests a relative weakening or strategic de-emphasis of the segment compared to others like Health & Public Service and Products, which saw stronger revenue growth.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AVGO used Backlog as a forward-looking indicator to guide investors on future revenue expectations, implying a strong pipeline of firm orders. By 2023, AVGO disclosed that its Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) stood at approximately $20.5 billion as of November 3, 2024, with 43% expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. The shift from Backlog to RPO reflects a more detailed and segmented view of contractual commitments, particularly in multi-year customer agreements. This evolution indicates that AVGO's visibility into future revenue improved through structured contract disclosures, though the company also noted that RPO is not fully indicative of future revenue due to termination rights and short-duration contracts.",

These statements are indicated by words or phrases such as 'anticipate,' 'expect,' 'estimate,' 'seek,' 'plan,' 'believe,' 'could,' 'intend,' 'will,' and similar words or phrases. These forward-looking statements may include projections of financial information; statements about historical results that may suggest trends for our business; statements of the plans, strategies, and objectives of management for future operations; statements of expectation or belief regarding future events (including any acquisitions we may make), technology developments, our products, product sales, expenses, liquidity, cash flow and growth rates, or enforceability of our intellectual property rights; any backlog; and the effects of seasonality on our business. Such statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections of our industry performance and macroeconomic conditions, based on management's judgment, beliefs, current trends and market conditions, and involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in the forward-looking statements. We derive most of our forward-looking statements from our operating budgets and forecasts, which are based upon many detailed assumptions. While we believe that our assumptions are reasonable, we caution that it is very difficult to predict the impact of known factors, and it is impossible for us to anticipate all factors that could affect our actual results.

      "answer": "In 2022, AVGO faced risks of excess inventory due to customer demand volatility and supply chain mismatches, which led to inventory write-downs and higher carrying costs that negatively impacted gross margins. This trend continued into 2023, where inventory adjustments\u2014including write-downs for obsolescence\u2014remained a key component of cost of goods sold. Additionally, underutilization of proprietary fabrication facilities in 2023 resulted in higher average unit costs, further compressing gross margins. The combination of these factors shows a clear 3-hop chain: AVGO(2022) \u2192 Excess Inventory \u2192 Gross Margins \u2190 AVGO(2023), where earlier inventory decisions and risks directly influenced later-year financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain challenges. More typically, however, to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.\n\nConversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. If we are unable to meet such increases in demand, this could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins'. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. A delay or cancellation of a customer's plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same time, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses. Further, often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line for those products. The qualification process can take significant time and resources. Delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.\n\n## Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.\n\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets.\n\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staffs, more established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development, technical and marketing resources than us. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free, competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who develop competing products.\n\nIn addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us. Some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection than us.\n\nThe actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

Despite these risks, the 2024 filing reaffirms QCOM\u2019s continued stake in the QTL segment, where substantially all revenues still come from licensing royalties tied to mobile handset sales. This indicates that QCOM has not materially diversified the QTL segment\u2019s revenue base away from mobile handsets, suggesting a strategic decision to maintain its licensing model despite known risks. The unchanged revenue recognition model\u2014'principally from royalties generated through licensees' sales of mobile handsets'\u2014shows that QCOM continues to prioritize and rely on its core licensing business, betting on the resilience of its IP portfolio and long-term licensing agreements to mitigate short-term licensee volatility.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices.

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft disclosed $1,341 million in technology-based intangible assets with a weighted average life of 4 years, alongside $627 million in marketing-related intangibles with an 11-year life. By 2024, the company reported a significant increase in total intangible assets, with technology-based intangibles rising to $9,689 million (still a 4-year life), and a new category\u2014Customer-related Intangibles\u2014emerged at $661 million, also with a 4-year life. This indicates a strategic shift in asset composition, where customer relationships became a distinct and material component of Microsoft's intangible portfolio, while maintaining the same amortization timeline as technology-based assets.

This category primarily includes certain expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of the reportable segments because the CODM does not consider these expenses and credits in  ev aluating  the  performance  of  the  reportable  segments.  T his  category  primarily  includes  amortization  of  acquisition-related  intangibles,  employee stock-based compensation, acquisition-related and other costs, restructuring charges and licensing gain. Acquisition-related and other costs primarily include transaction costs, purchase price fair v alue adjustments for inv entory, certain compensation charges, contract termination costs and workforce rebalancing charges.",

      "answer": "In 2023, TXN reported a total cost of revenue of $6,500 million (chunk 1), with the Analog Segment contributing $4,869 million of the total $6,547 million cost in 2024 (chunk 2). Despite this slight increase in cost, the Analog Segment's gross profit rose from an implied $8,019 million in 2023 (calculated from 2023 total revenue of $17,519 million minus total cost of revenue of $6,500 million) to $7,292 million in 2024 (chunk 3), indicating improved cost efficiency and margin performance. This evolution suggests that although the cost of revenue remained relatively stable year-over-year, the Analog Segment's profitability improved significantly, contributing more strongly to TXN\u2019s overall financial performance.",

      "question": "How did the increase in ACN's workforce from 733,000 in fiscal 2023 to 774,000 in fiscal 2024, and the associated rise in compensation costs, influence the company's sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 2024?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, ACN's workforce was approximately 733,000, and it increased to 774,000 by fiscal 2024 due to acquisitions and hiring for specific skills. This growth in workforce directly contributed to higher compensation costs, which are a significant portion of operating expenses. Since sales and marketing costs are primarily driven by compensation for business development activities, the increase in headcount and associated compensation expenses in fiscal 2024 likely contributed to a shift in sales and marketing expenditures. While exact figures for sales and marketing costs are not provided, the overall operating expenses remained relatively stable as a percentage of revenue (85.2% in fiscal 2024 vs. 86.3% in fiscal 2023), suggesting that ACN managed to balance increased compensation costs with efficiency measures.",

Revenue growth was driven by the United States.\n- EMEA revenues were flat in local currency, as growth in Public Service was offset by declines in Communications &amp; M edia and Banking &amp; Capital M arkets. Revenues were driven by an increase in Italy, offset by declines in France and the United Kingdom.\n- Growth Markets revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by growth in Banking &amp; Capital M arkets, Industrial and Chemicals &amp; Natural Resources. Revenue growth was driven by Japan and Argentina, partially offset by declines in A ustralia and Brazil. A rgentina revenues grew in local currency due primarily to hyperinflation.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal 2024 decreased $1 million from fiscal 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.2% from 86.3% during this period.\n\nThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs such as facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions.

      "answer": "The FY24 revenue breakdown shows that the Software & Platforms subsegment (42% of group revenue) slightly outpaced the Communications & Media subsegment (40% of group revenue) within the overall Communications, Media & Technology segment. This suggests a nuanced shift in strategic emphasis toward software-driven and platform-based services compared to traditional communications and media offerings. This interpretation is supported by the structure of revenue reporting in FY23, which established the baseline for how Accenture categorizes and discloses its industry groups, including the Communications, Media & Technology segment.

      "answer": "In 2022, QCT contributed $12,837 million to QCOM's EBT, indicating strong profitability from its semiconductor business. However, by 2023, this contribution dropped significantly to $7,924 million, reflecting a decline in QCT's performance. Meanwhile, QSI, which had previously reported a $279 million loss in 2022, improved its EBT to a $12 million gain in 2023, signaling better returns from strategic investments. Despite QSI's improvement, the overall EBT for QCOM declined due to the larger drop in QCT's contribution, highlighting the heavy reliance on QCT's performance for overall profitability.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, certain share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development expenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. Our CODM does not evaluate our operating segments using discrete asset information.",

      "answer": "In both 2023 and 2024, TXN continued to classify litigation expenses as part of the 'Other' segment, indicating consistency in how corporate-level items are excluded from the performance evaluation of reportable segments. This treatment shows that the company maintains a clear distinction between operational segment performance and non-operational corporate expenses when assessing business units like Analog and Embedded Processing.

We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other.

Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

      "question": "Given that the Embedded Processing segment contributed $352 million to TXN's operating profit in 2024 compared to its role in the business structure in 2022, how has its relative profitability and strategic positioning changed within Texas Instruments' overall business model?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Embedded Processing segment was one of two reportable segments for TXN, indicating its strategic importance in the company's business model. However, by 2024, its operating profit contribution had declined significantly compared to the Analog segment, which contributed $4,608 million. The Embedded Processing segment's operating profit of $352 million in 2024 represented only 6.4% of total company operating profit, highlighting a reduced emphasis relative to the Analog segment. This suggests a shift in TXN's strategic positioning, with greater focus on the Analog segment as the core profit driver, while Embedded Processing plays a more secondary role in the business model.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Apple's Services Gross Margin increased due to higher Services net sales and improved leverage, despite foreign currency headwinds. This margin improvement positively impacted the performance of Apple's Americas Segment in 2023, where gross margin percentage growth was partially attributed to higher services gross margin. The 2023 segment report confirms that the Americas segment benefited from this dynamic, alongside productivity gains and favorable product mix, despite pricing pressures. This shows a clear linkage between the margin strength in services and the overall segment performance across the two years.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Broadcom completed the purchase of a 300-millimeter semiconductor factory in Lehi, Utah, for $893 million, with $526 million allocated to machinery and equipment as part of the assets acquired. This acquisition significantly contributed to the machinery and equipment base at the start of the measurement and operational period. By fiscal year 2024, the company reported $5,246 million in machinery and equipment, up from $4,739 million in 2023, indicating continued investment and growth in this asset class. The trajectory shows a clear increase of $507 million in machinery and equipment value over the two years, reflecting both the initial acquisition impact and subsequent capital expenditures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nor over the lease period, whichever is shorter, and machinery and equipment are generally depreciated over 3 to 10 years. We use the straight-line method of depreciation for all property, plant and equipment.\n\nLeases. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement and evaluate whether the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease at the commencement date. We recognize right-ofuse ('ROU') assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases with terms greater than 12 months, and account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. ROU assets represent our right to use an asset for the lease term, while lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating and finance lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at the lease commencement date. We use the implicit interest rate or, if not readily determinable, our incremental borrowing rate as of the lease commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rate is based on our unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for the effects of collateral. Operating and finance lease ROU assets are recognized net of any lease prepayments and incentives. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Finance lease expense is recognized based on the effectiveinterest method over the lease term.\n\nFair value measurement. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received upon sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A three-level hierarchy is applied to prioritize the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).\n\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the guidance for fair value measurements are described below:\n\nLevel 1 - Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Our Level 1 assets include cash equivalents, banker's acceptances, trading securities investments and investment funds. We measure trading securities investments and investment funds at quoted market prices as they are traded in active markets with sufficient volume and frequency of transactions.\n\nLevel 2 - Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. If the asset or liability has a specified contractual term, a Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\n\nLevel 3 - Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability in which there is little, if any, market activity for the asset or liability at the measurement date. Level 3 assets and liabilities include investment in equity securities without readily determinable fair values, goodwill, intangible assets, and property, plant and equipment, which are measured at fair value using a discounted cash flow approach when they are impaired. Quantitative information for Level 3 assets and liabilities reviewed at each reporting period includes indicators of significant deterioration in the earnings performance, credit rating, asset quality, business prospects of the investee, and financial indicators of the investee's ability to continue as a going concern.\n\nBusiness combinations. We account for business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting, which requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date as well as contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recognized in our consolidated statements of operations. Accounting for business combinations requires our management to make significant estimates and assumptions, especially at the acquisition date including our estimates for intangible assets, contractual obligations assumed, restructuring liabilities, pre-acquisition contingencies, and contingent consideration, where applicable. Although we believe the assumptions and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate, they are based, in part, on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain. Critical estimates in valuing certain acquired intangible assets under the income approach include growth in future expected cash flows from product sales, customer contracts and acquired technologies, revenue growth rate, customer ramp-up period, technology obsolescence rates, expected costs to develop in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D') into commercially viable products, estimated cash flows from the projects when completed and discount rates. Unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions, estimates or actual results.",

      "question": "How did the change in AMD's acquisition-related and other costs between 2023 ($258 million) and 2024 impact their All Other category's influence on segment performance evaluation in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMD reported $258 million in acquisition-related and other costs as part of the All Other category, which also included $2.8 billion in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and $1.4 billion in stock-based compensation. By 2024, the All Other category continued to include acquisition-related and other costs among its unallocated expenses, indicating that these costs remained outside the evaluation of AMD\u2019s reportable segments. The persistence of these costs in the All Other category suggests that they continued to distort the visibility into segment-level performance, as they were not allocated to any reportable segment for evaluation purposes. This accounting treatment implies that the true operating performance of AMD\u2019s core segments may appear stronger than it would if these costs were included, making year-over-year comparisons challenging without adjusting for these non-operational expenses.",

Despite this relatively stable trend in segment-specific amortization, acquisition-related intangible amortization expense was explicitly called out in 2024 as a separate item not allocated to either the Compute & Networking or Graphics segments, and instead included in 'All Other'. This reveals that while the Graphics segment's internal amortization remained consistent, the company's broader acquisition strategy introduced new intangible expenses that were treated separately for operational and financial reporting purposes, indicating a deliberate effort to isolate the financial impact of acquisitions from core segment performance.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

      "question": "How did the severity and underlying causes of Cisco's inventory-related gross margin risks change from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, and how did these evolving supply chain pressures compare to AMD's inventory challenges documented in the same period?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Cisco highlighted that excess inventory could harm gross margins due to risks in managing two-tier distribution channel inventory, including potential distributor behavior like order cancellations and returns, and the risk of inventory write-downs due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. By fiscal 2023, Cisco specifically warned that prior inventory and purchase commitments made to mitigate supply constraints could lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charges or negative impacts to gross margins if demand decreased or supply chain exposures persisted. Meanwhile, AMD also documented inventory risk in 2022, citing that overproduction due to inaccurate demand forecasting or sudden drops in product demand could lead to excess inventory, which would negatively affect gross margins. The comparison shows that both companies faced similar supply chain-driven inventory risks, but Cisco's exposure intensified in 2023 due to earlier strategic commitments made during component shortages, which introduced longer-term financial risks not as explicitly documented for AMD.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe  also  face  competition  from  customers  to  which  we  license  or  supply  technology  and  suppliers  from  which  we  transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and at the same time compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.\n\n## If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances, and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.\n\nWe  have  several  strategic  alliances  with  large  and  complex  organizations  and  other  companies  with  which  we  work  to  offer complementary products and services. These arrangements are generally limited to specific projects, the goal of which is generally to  facilitate  product  compatibility  and  adoption  of  industry  standards.  There  can  be  no  assurance  we  will  realize  the  expected benefits from these strategic alliances or from joint ventures. If successful, these relationships may be mutually beneficial and result in industry growth. However, alliances carry an element of risk because, in most cases, we must compete in some business areas with a company with which we have a strategic alliance and, at the same time, cooperate with that company in other business areas. Also, if these companies fail to perform or if these relationships fail to materialize as expected, we could suffer delays in product development or other operational difficulties. Joint ventures can be difficult to manage, given the potentially different interests of joint venture partners.\n\n## Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.\n\nWe must manage inventory relating to sales to our distributors effectively, because inventory held by them could affect our results of operations. Our distributors may increase orders during periods of product shortages, cancel orders if their inventory is too high, or delay orders in anticipation of new products. They also may adjust their orders in response to the supply of our products and the products of our competitors that are available to them, and in response to seasonal fluctuations in end-user demand. Our distributors are generally given business terms that allow them to return a portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling price, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs. Inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements. When facing component supply-related challenges, we have increased our efforts in procuring components in order to meet customer expectations. If we ultimately determine that we have excess inventory, we may have to reduce our prices and write down inventory, which in turn could result in lower gross margins.\n\n## We depend upon the development of new products and services, and enhancements to existing products and services, and if we fail to predict and respond to emerging technological trends and customers' changing needs, our operating results and market share may suffer.\n\nThe markets for  our  products  and  services  are  characterized  by  rapidly  changing  technology,  evolving  industry  standards,  new product and service introductions, and evolving methods of building and operating networks. Our operating results depend on our ability to develop and introduce new products and services into existing and emerging markets and to reduce the production costs of  existing  products.  If  customers  do  not  purchase  and/or  renew  our  offerings  our  business  could  be  harmed.  The  COVID-19 pandemic may also result in long-term changes in customer needs for our products and services in various sectors, along with ITrelated capital spending reductions, or shifts in spending focus, that could materially adversely affect us if we are unable to adjust our product and service offerings to match customer needs.\n\nThe process of developing new technology, including more programmable, flexible and virtual networks, and technology related to other market transitions- such as security, digital transformation and IoT, and cloud- is complex and uncertain, and if we fail to accurately predict customers' changing needs and emerging technological trends our business could be harmed. We must commit significant resources, including the investments we have been making in our strategic priorities to developing new products and services before knowing whether our investments will result in products and services the market will accept. In particular, if our model of the evolution of networking does not emerge as we believe it will, or if the industry does not evolve as we believe it will, or if our strategy for addressing this evolution is not successful, many of our strategic initiatives and investments may be of no or limited  value.  For  example,  if  we  do  not  introduce  products  related  to  network  programmability,  such  as  software-definednetworking products, in a timely fashion, or if product offerings in this market that ultimately succeed are based on technology, or an approach to technology, that differs from ours, such as, for example, networking products based on 'white box' hardware, our business could be harmed. Similarly, our business could be harmed if we fail to develop, or fail to develop in a timely fashion, offerings  to  address  other  transitions,  or  if  the  offerings  addressing  these  other  transitions  that  ultimately  succeed  are  based  on technology,  or  an  approach  to  technology,  different  from  ours.  In  addition,  our  business  could  be  adversely  affected  in  periods surrounding  our  new  product  introductions  if  customers  delay  purchasing  decisions  to  qualify  or  otherwise  evaluate  the  new product offerings. We have also been transforming our business to move from selling individual",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco reported unbilled contract revenue of $8,275M, down from $8,729M in 2021, indicating a reduction in unfulfilled obligations yet to be invoiced. By 2023, unbilled contract revenue was explicitly described as representing noncancelable contracts where performance was still pending and revenue had not yet been recognized. This evolution shows that the company's unbilled contract revenue from 2022 transitioned into 2023 as binding noncancelable obligations, suggesting that the company was working through a slightly reduced backlog compared to the prior year, which could signal either slower execution or tighter contract management.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's gross carrying amount of total intangible assets decreased from $4,135 million in fiscal year 2022 to $3,091 million in fiscal year 2023. This indicates a reduction in the value of intangible assets carried on the balance sheet, which could reflect amortization, asset write-downs, or a strategic shift in managing acquired assets. The decrease of $1,044 million suggests that NVIDIA may have focused on consolidating existing intangible assets rather than acquiring new ones during this period.",

By 2024, Adobe formalized the composition of its Digital Media ARR as the sum of Creative ARR and Document Cloud ARR. This structural clarification indicates that Document Cloud's contribution became more explicitly defined within the broader Digital Media segment. While specific 2024 Document Cloud ARR figures are not disclosed, the shift from a narrative description of growth in 2022 to a formalized metric definition in 2024 suggests that Document Cloud's financial impact was increasingly material and strategically significant to Adobe's overall ARR reporting.",

We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020 which represents 24% yearover-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021 from $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Workfront's workflow platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.\n\n## COVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess,  conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As  a  result,  we  have  reopened  our  offices  in  areas  with  sustained  low  infection  rates  and  are  allowing  fully  vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.\n\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021\n\nOur financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion  in  fiscal  2020. The  increases  were  primarily  due  to  subscription  revenue  growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal  2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\n- Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily  due  to  increases  in  base  and  incentive  compensation  and  related  benefits  costs,  as  well  as  increased marketing spend.",

      "question": "How did the divestiture of Intel's NAND memory business in 2022 contribute to the 32% decline in 'All Other Revenue' reported in 2024, and what strategic shifts were made in the intervening period that impacted this financial trajectory?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Intel fully deconsolidated its NAND memory business following a divestiture agreement with SK hynix, which had been a key part of the NSG segment. This divestiture significantly reduced Intel's revenue base from storage solutions and marked a strategic pivot away from memory manufacturing. By 2024, this shift was reflected in a 32% year-over-year decrease in 'All Other Revenue', driven in part by the absence of revenue previously generated by the NAND business. During the intervening period, Intel refocused on core semiconductor products, with increased investment in CCG and DCAI segments, while also experiencing reduced Altera and Mobileye revenues due to inventory adjustments by customers. The exit from the NAND business thus directly contributed to the decline in 'All Other Revenue' and signaled a broader strategic realignment toward Intel's core competencies.",

NSG is disrupting the memory and storage hierarchy with new tiers that balance capacity, performance, and cost. Our products are available in innovative form factors and densities to address the memory and storage challenges our customers face in a rapidly evolving technological landscape. Our customers include enterprise and cloud-based data centers, and users of business and consumer desktops and laptops.\n\n## Key Developments\n\n- \u25a0 Revenue was lower in 2021, driven by market softness and pricing pressure. NAND profitability improved due to the absence of depreciation expense from NAND property, plant and equipment that was held for sale throughout 2021.\n- \u25a0 We launched the Intel SSD D5-P5316, our first 144-layer QLC NAND SSD for the Data Center, which is available up to 30.72TB in both the U.2 and efficient E1.L form factors. An upgrade of our SATA drive, the Intel SSD D3-S4520 and D3-S4620, also launched with Intel's latest-gen 144-layer TLC NAND and is available in 2.5' and M.2 form factors up to 7.68TB capacity. For our consumer market, the Intel  SSD 670p with 144-layer QLC NAND launched with improved performance, storage responsiveness, and endurance with high capacity (up to 2TB). \u00ae \u00ae \u00ae\n- \u25a0 In October 2020, we signed an agreement with SK hynix to divest our NAND memory business. The NAND memory business makes up our NSG segment. The transaction will occur over two closings, the first of which was completed on December 29, 2021, subsequent to our fiscal 2021 year-end. We will fully deconsolidate our ongoing interests in the NAND OpCo Business in the first quarter of 2022. Refer to \"Note 10 : Acquisitions and Divestitures\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on the divestiture.\n\n\"Storage technologies help drive the computing experience. Put simply, in today's data-driven world, advances in both data center and client computing need to be matched by cutting-edge innovation in the memoryand-storage space.\"\n\n-Rob Crooke, NSG General Manager\n\n## 5-Year Trends",

All other revenue decreased 32% from 2023, driven by lower A ltera revenue due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and lower M obileye revenue as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories of EyeQ products. Intel Foundry external revenue decreased 60% from 2023 due to lower traditional packaging services and lower equipment sales. Intel Products revenue increased 3% from 2023 due primarily to higher CCG and DCAI revenue. CCG revenue increased 4% from 2023 primarily due to higher notebook volume compared to 2023 and was partially  offset by  lower other CCG rev enue, which decreased from 2023 due to the exit of legacy businesses, and lower desktop revenue, which decreased on lower demand compared to 2023. DCAI revenue increased 1% from 2023 driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.\n\n- Excludes intersegment revenue; totals may not sum due to rounding 1\n\nMD&amp;A",

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel reported total amortization expenses of $1,839 million, which included developed technology ($1,283 million), customer relationships and brands ($209 million), and licensed technology and patents ($347 million). By 2024, total amortization expenses had decreased to $1,428 million, with developed technology dropping significantly to $879 million. Notably, in 2024, Intel introduced a new category \u2014 internal-use software \u2014 with an amortization expense of $24 million.

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel guided for non-GAAP gross margins to be between 51% and 53% over the next several years, citing pressure from capacity investments and process technology acceleration. This guidance was influenced by the risk of inventory obsolescence due to supply chain mismatches and rapid product lifecycle changes, as seen in the AMD filing, which highlighted how inaccurate demand forecasting can lead to excess inventory write-downs that negatively impact gross margins. In 2023, Intel disclosed that they actively wrote off excess inventory when demand forecasts exceeded actual demand, confirming the materialization of the risk mentioned in 2022. Additionally, Intel adjusted the useful life of certain manufacturing equipment from 5 to 8 years, a policy change that likely aimed to stabilize margins by spreading depreciation costs over a longer period, countering some of the margin pressures from inventory write-offs. Thus, the 2022 guidance and risk factors were directly reflected in 2023 actions and disclosures.",

          "chunk_text": "## A Year in Review\n\nTotal revenue of $79.0 billion was up year over year, with CCG revenue up 1% and DCG revenue down 1%, both amid the effects of industrywide supply constraints. We experienced strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market segments. DCG was down on lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform  volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment. IOTG and Mobileye both achieved strong results on higher demand amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. We invested $15.2 billion in R&amp;D, made capital investments of $18.7 billion, and generated $30.0 billion in cash from operations and $11.3 billion of free cash flow. 1\n\n\"We achieved solid results amid a highly constrained industry-wide supply environment while continuing to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity position. With our IDM 2.0 strategy, we enter a phase of significant investment, positioning us for product leadership and long-term growth.\"\n\n-David Zinsner, Chief Financial Officer\n\n## $79.0B $74.7B\n\n## $19.5B\n\n## $22.2B\n\n## $4.86\n\n## $5.47\n\n## $30.0B\n\n## $11.3B\n\n## GAAP\n\nnon-GAAP 2\n\nRevenue up 1% from 2020\n\nRevenue up 2% from 2020\n\n## GAAP\n\n## non-GAAP 2\n\nOperating income down $4.2B or 18% from 2020; 2021 operating margin at 25%\n\nOperating income down $2.2B or 9% from 2020; 2021 operating margin at 30%\n\nHigher revenue in CCG, IOTG, Mobileye, and PSG, partially offset by declines in DCG and NSG.

Free cash flow decreased due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital expenditures.\n\n## Investing in our IDM 2.0 strategy for the long term\n\nTo support our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are making significant capital investments to increase our manufacturing capacity and accelerate our process technology roadmap, as well as increasing our investments in R&amp;D. We believe these investments will position us for accelerating long-term revenue growth. We expect our long-term revenue outlook to accelerate to a 10% to 12% year-over-year growth rate by the end of our five-year horizon as supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products. We expect gross margins to be impacted by our investments in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, resulting in expected non-GAAP gross margins percentages between 51% and 53%  over the next several years before moving upward. We also expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. We expect our cash from operations to be strong, but our capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term. 2\n\n- See \"Our Products\" within MD&amp;A. 1\n- See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&amp;A. 2",

          "chunk_text": "We  often  partner  with  third-party  providers  for  certain  worker  services  and  we  may  provide  certain  limited  worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

      "answer": "The QTL segment revenue increased from $731 million in 2022 to $734 million in 2023, representing only a $3 million growth. This minimal increase occurred despite risks in 2022 that could have negatively impacted licensing revenues, such as reductions in average selling prices of licensees' products and potential security vulnerabilities affecting product performance. Since the QTL segment primarily recognizes revenue from licensing and royalties (as noted in the 2022 filing), this slight growth suggests that Qualcomm's licensing model remained relatively stable and resilient during this period, even in the face of external risks and market pressures.",

In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees' products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\n\n## Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\n\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure (including applications). Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices.\n\nThe use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers' products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers' products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers' businesses or the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of our customers, their employees or the end users of our customers' devices. While we continue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures, and techniques used to perpetrate cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information .'\n\nOur products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers' products and networks. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, meet certain regulatory or industry standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), or other product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the devices into which our products are integrated and the end users of such devices, and potentially to our customers' IT infrastructure. Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory or indemnification obligations under our agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brand. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in the products of our customers or licensees could cause a delay or decrease in demand for the products into which our products are integrated, and thus for our products.\n\nIn addition, the occurrence of defects, errors or security vulnerabilities may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technology we use, or the products into which they are integrated, result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. We may also be required to indemnify and/or defend our customers from product liability claims relating to our products. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as: automobiles, including ADAS/AD functions; cameras and artificial intelligence, including home and enterprise security; home automation, including smoke and noxious gas detectors; medical condition monitoring; location and asset tracking and management, including wearables for child safety and elderly health; robotics, including public safety drones and autonomous municipality vehicles; and extended reality (XR) for treatment of phobias or PTSD, early detection of disorders or special needs, among others.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm's QTL segment derived substantially all of its revenues from royalties generated through licensees' sales of mobile handsets, indicating a strong dependency on external sales performance. By 2024, this dependency remained, but new risks emerged, including potential litigation involving patent disputes, which could disrupt the supply chain and result in a decline in licensees' sales. Additionally, the use of open source software posed risks to Qualcomm\u2019s intellectual property, which underpins its licensing model. These developments suggest that while the QTL segment's reliance on licensees' sales remained stable, the exposure to legal and operational risks increased significantly, potentially threatening the sustainability of this revenue model.",

          "chunk_text": "In any potential dispute involving us and another company's patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product release or shipment delays and/or damage to our customer relationships, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers' devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.\n\n## Our use of open source software may harm our business.\n\nCertain of our software and our suppliers' software may contain or may be derived from 'open source' software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products' source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such open source software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers, or to license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing programs depend, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\n\n## GENERAL RISK FACTORS\n\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments or reserves, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. During such downturns, our revenues have declined, and our results of operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted. We expect our business to continue to be subject to such cyclical downturns.\n\nA decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on wireless device inventories.

      "question": "How did Cisco's (CSCO) credit loss allowance for lease receivables evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this imply about the risk profile of their sales-type leases given the dependency between these financial constructs?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco reported a credit loss allowance of $23 million for lease receivables, which are primarily composed of sales-type leases. By 2024, this allowance had decreased to $19 million, indicating a reduction in expected credit losses. This change suggests an improvement in the credit quality of lessees or more conservative underwriting in sales-type lease agreements over the period. The decrease in allowance, despite the ongoing reliance on sales-type leases as a financing mechanism, implies a potential tightening of credit standards or improved collection performance in Cisco's leasing activities.",

      "answer": "In 2022, TXN incurred $54 million in restructuring charges/other, which had a negative impact on operating profit. By 2023, these charges were eliminated entirely, providing a favorable year-over-year comparison. The 2023 operating profit section noted an 11-percentage-point favorable impact from prior-year charges associated with capacity expansion and productivity savings. Despite this benefit, TXN's operating margin still declined by 0.2 percentage points in 2023 compared to 2022. This suggests that while the removal of restructuring charges positively affected operating profit, it was not sufficient to overcome other margin pressures such as reduced factory loadings and increased manufacturing costs. The favorable impact from the prior-year charges helped offset some of these negative factors, but could not fully reverse the margin contraction.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Adobe reported a weighted average useful life of 4 years for $331 million in purchased technology. In 2023, there is an inconsistency in reporting: the useful life table states 5 years for purchased technology, while the detailed intangible assets table shows only 3 years for the $100 million in purchased technology. This creates ambiguity in Adobe's amortization policy \u2014 if the 5-year figure was intended, it would suggest a more long-term view of technology assets compared to 2022; however, the 3-year figure implies a shorter-lived asset base, which could indicate more specialized or rapidly evolving technologies from recent acquisitions. The significant drop in purchased technology value from $331M to $100M also suggests a strategic shift in acquisition focus.",

      "question": "How did the increase in AMD's Licensing Gain from $34 million in 2023 to $48 million in 2024 reflect a shift in the financial impact of the 'All Other' category, which also includes restructuring charges and amortization of acquisition-related intangibles?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMD's Licensing Gain was $34 million, and by 2024, it increased to $48 million, indicating a growing positive contribution from non-core operational activities within the 'All Other' category. This category, which includes items like amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, restructuring charges, and employee stock-based compensation, became more financially favorable over time. The increase in Licensing Gain suggests that AMD may have realized more value from its IP licensing activities, which are not part of its core reportable segments but still impact overall financial performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD(2023) \u2192 All Other Category: In 2023, AMD's 'All Other' category included a licensing gain of $34 million, among other non-core expenses and credits.",
        "Hop 2: All Other Category \u2192 Licensing Gain: The 'All Other' category explicitly includes licensing gain as one of its key components, indicating that this financial item is directly tied to the broader non-core financial activities of the company.",
        "Hop 3: Licensing Gain \u2190 AMD(2024): In 2024, the licensing gain increased to $48 million, showing a significant year-over-year growth in this non-core revenue stream."

      "question": "How did the change in the Americas segment balance from 2023 to 2024 interact with pricing pressures to affect gross margin performance, given the disclosed negative impacts from pricing in 2023 and the intensifying price-focused competition from Asia in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Americas segment balance increased from $23,882 million to $24,035 million, reflecting modest growth. However, the 2023 gross margin analysis noted that pricing pressures had a negative impact on gross margin performance, despite productivity benefits and favorable product mix. By 2024, the company disclosed intensifying price-focused competition, particularly from Asian vendors like those in China, which likely exacerbated these pricing pressures. This suggests that while the Americas segment grew slightly in balance, the ongoing and potentially worsening pricing pressures from global competition may have continued to constrain gross margin improvements in 2024, despite operational efficiencies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Strategic Alliances\n\nWe pursue strategic alliances with other companies in areas where collaboration can produce industry advancement and accelerate new markets. The objectives and goals of a strategic alliance can include one or more of the following: technology exchange, product development, joint sales and marketing, or new market creation.\n\nThe risks associated with our strategic alliances are more fully discussed in 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' including the risk factor entitled 'If we do not successfully manage our strategic alliances, we may not realize the expected benefits from such alliances and we may experience increased competition or delays in product development.'\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete in the networking and communications equipment markets, providing products and services designed to transport, and help secure data, voice, and video traffic across cloud, private and public networks and the Internet. We compete with numerous vendors in each product category. The overall number of our competitors providing niche product solutions may increase. Also, the identity and composition of competitors may change as we increase our activity in newer product areas, and in key priority areas. As we continue to expand globally, we may see new competition in different geographic regions. In particular, we have experienced price-focused competition from competitors in Asia, especially from China, and we anticipate this will continue.\n\nOur competitors (in each case relative to only some of our products or services) include: Amazon Web Services LLC; Arista Networks, Inc.; Broadcom Inc.; Ciena Corporation;  CrowdStrike  Holdings,  Inc.;  Datadog  Inc.;  Dell  Technologies  Inc.;  Dynatrace  Inc.;  Fortinet,  Inc.;  Hewlett-Packard  Enterprise  Company;  Huawei Technologies  Co.,  Ltd.;  Juniper  Networks,  Inc.;  Microsoft  Corporation;  New  Relic,  Inc.;  Nokia  Corporation;  Nvidia  Corporation;  Palo  Alto  Networks,  Inc.; RingCentral, Inc.; Zoom Video Communications, Inc.; and Zscaler, Inc.; among others.\n\nSome of our competitors compete across many of our product lines, while others are primarily focused in a specific product area. Barriers to entry are relatively low, and new ventures to create products that do or could compete with our products are regularly formed. In addition, some of our competitors may have greater resources,  including  technical  and  engineering  resources,  than  we  do.  As  we  ex pand  into  new  markets,  we  will  face  competition  not  only  from  our  ex isting competitors but also from other competitors, including existing companies with strong technological, marketing, and sales positions in those markets.  We also sometimes face competition from resellers and distributors of our products. Companies with which we have strategic alliances in some areas may be competitors in other  areas,  and  this  trend  may  increase.  For  ex ample,  the  enterprise  data  center  is  undergoing  a  fundamental  transformation  arising  from  the  convergence  of technologies, including computing, networking, storage, and software, that previously were segregated. Additionally, companies that are strategic alliance partners in some areas of our business may acquire or form alliances with our competitors, thereby reducing their business with us.\n\nThe principal  competitive  factors  in  the  markets  in  which  we  presently  compete  and  may  compete  in  the  future  include  the  ability  to  sell  successful  business outcomes; the ability to provide a broad range of networking and communications products and services; product performance; price; the ability to introduce new products, including providing continuous new customer value and products with price-performance advantages; the ability to reduce production costs; the ability to provide value-added features such as security, reliability, and investment protection; conformance to standards; market presence; the ability to provide financing; and disruptive technology shifts and new business models.\n\nWe also face competition from customers to which we license or supply technology and suppliers from which we transfer technology. The inherent nature of networking requires interoperability. As such, we must cooperate and, at the same time, compete with many companies. Any inability to effectively manage these complicated relationships with customers, suppliers, and strategic alliance partners could materially harm our business, operating results, and financial condition and accordingly affect our chances of success.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nWe regularly introduce new products and features to address the requirements of our markets. We allocate our research and development budget among our product categories, which consist of Networking, Security, Collaboration, and Observability technologies. Our research and development expenditures are applied generally to all product areas, with specific areas of focus being identified from time to time. Our ex penditures for research and development costs were ex pensed as incurred.\n\nThe  industry  in  which  we  compete  is  subject  to  rapid  technological  developments,  evolving  standards,  changes  in  customer  requirements,  and  new  product introductions and enhancements. As a result, our success depends, in part, on our ability, on a cost-effective and timely basis, to continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and introduce new products that improve performance and reduce total cost of ownership. To achieve these objectives, our management and engineering personnel work with customers to identify and respond to customer needs, as well as with other innovators of internet networking products, including universities, laboratories, and corporations. We also expect to continue to make acquisitions and",

      "question": "How did the restructuring of Intel's internal foundry model in 2024 impact the relationship between CCG and Intel Products, particularly in terms of manufacturing dependencies and segment cost structures compared to 2022?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Intel's Client Computing Group (CCG) was a core segment that Intel depended on for CPU design and development, with manufacturing tightly integrated under the same business unit. By 2024, the implementation of the internal foundry model restructured Intel Products to include CCG, DCAI, and NEX, while manufacturing was shifted to Intel Foundry. This created a formal intersegment relationship where Intel Products now incurs intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, a change from the pre-2024 integrated model. This shift aimed to increase transparency and cost accountability, directly altering how CCG's product development costs and manufacturing expenses are reported within Intel Products.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: INTC(2022) \u2192 CCG: Intel relied on CCG as a key operating segment for client computing, with tightly integrated design and manufacturing.",
        "Hop 2: CCG \u2192 Intel Products: CCG became a component of the newly defined Intel Products segment in 2024, which also included DCAI and NEX.",
        "Hop 3: Intel Products \u2190 INTC(2024): Intel Products now incurs intersegment manufacturing charges from Intel Foundry, a change from the 2022 model where manufacturing was internally integrated without formal intersegment cost transfers."

A  discussion regarding our consolidated results of operations for 2023 relative to 2022 is included in our 2023 Form 10-K. \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K reconciles our segment and consolidated results for each of the periods presented.\n\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" w ithin MD&amp;A. 1\n\n## Operating Segment Trends and Results\n\n## Intel Products\n\nIntel Products consists substantially of the design, development, marketing, sale, support, and servicing of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Products is composed of three operating segments: CCG, DCAI, and NEX.\n\n## Client Computing Group\n\n## Market and Business Overview\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are committed to advancing PC experiences by delivering competitive products and deepening our relationships with industry partners to co-engineer and deliver leading platform innovation. We bring together the operating system, system architecture, hardware, and software application integration to enable industry-leading PC experiences. We embrace these opportunities by focusing on our roadmap, delivering innovative PC capabilities, and designing advanced PC experiences. By doing this, we believe we help fuel innovation across the industry, providing a solid source of IP, scale, and cash flow for Intel.\n\n## Market Trends and Strategy\n\nIn 2024, the PC market started to stabilize from a soft macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures, with PC supply and demand levels beginning to normalize. We remain positive on the long-term outlook for PCs, as household density is stable to increasing, educational device penetration rates remain low outside of the US, and PC usage remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic rates . Commercial growth opportunities also remain as corporations expand the size of their PC fleets, while also replacing older devices. Currently, more than 200 million commercial devices are more than four years old . 1 2\n\nWe recently introduced our Intel Core Ultra processor family that serves as the CPU for the A I PC, which enables A I capabilities at the client level. We believe the A I PC is a significant potential driver of PC demand over the coming years, and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend that we expect will support a long-term PC TAM  of 300 million units . 3\n\nWe deliver value to our customers by leveraging our engineering capabilities and working with our partners across an open, innovative ecosystem to deliver technology that drives every major aspect of the computing experience, including performance, power efficiency, battery life, connectivity, graphics, and form factors, to create the most advanced PC platforms. We design our products with a philosophy of openness and choice, and seek to continually provide more competitive products with more capabilities for customers.\n\n## Products and Competition\n\nIn 2023, we introduced a significant update to our client compute brands to make it easier for customers to identify the right client solutions for their compute needs. Those brands include Intel, Intel Core and Intel Core Ultra. The Intel and Intel Core brands have been staples of the PC industry for nearly two decades and represented our highest volume products by unit sales in 2024. These products are designed to serve a broad cross-section of the customer and computing needs in the client market.\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra processor family, which we launched at the end of 2023, delivers significant advancements in graphics, A I, and multi-threaded CPU performance and introduced the AI PC to the market. In the second half of 2024, the next-generation Intel Core Ultra 200V  Series became our highest performance client processors, with increased battery life for mobile PCs. We also introduced the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series processors, catering to the desktop enthusiast market. We remain committed to delivering the most advanced processing power to support the growing demands of AI, graphics, and multithreaded workloads.\n\nWe operate in a particularly competitive market. In processors, we compete with A dvanced M icro Devices, Inc. (A M D) and vendors who design applications processors based on ARM architecture, such as Apple Inc. (A pple) with its M  series products and Qualcomm Inc. (Qualcomm) with its Snapdragon product. We expect this competitive environment to continue to intensify in 2025.\n\nWe remain committed to creating an open ecosystem to foster growth and technology innovations. We embrace and collaborate with a global ecosystem of industry partners to deliver competitive technologies together.\n\n- Source: Intel calculated PC density from industry analyst reports. 1\n- Source: Intel calculated volume of devices over four years old from industry analyst reports and internal data. 2\n- Source: Intel calculated multi-year TAM forecast derived from industry analyst reports. 3\n\nMD&amp;A",

A n estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Note 3 : Operating Segments\n\nWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utiliz e marketing, sales, and other support functions.\n\nOur internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate A ltera as a standalone business. A ltera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" A s a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. A ll prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our operating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.\n\nWe organize our business as follows:\n\n- Intel Products:\n- Client Computing Group (CCG)\n- Data Center and AI (DCAI)\n- Network and Edge (NEX)\n- Intel Foundry\n- All other:\n- Altera\n- Mobileye\n- Other\n\nCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX , A ltera, and M obileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.\n\nThe accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A  summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:\n\n## Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX\n\n- Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.\n- Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n68",

By 2023, the weighted average useful life for purchased technology had further decreased to 3 years, while the 5-year benchmark remained constant. This divergence suggests a strategic shift toward acquiring technologies with shorter expected useful lives, potentially reflecting faster innovation cycles or more near-term focused acquisitions.",

By 2024, these acquisition-related costs were no longer listed separately but were instead included within the 'Other' segment, which also reported an operating profit of $505 million and restructuring charges of $124 million.

          "chunk_text": "- Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.\n- For an explanation of free cash flow and the term 'annual operating tax rate,' see the Non-GAAP financial information section.\n- All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.\n\nOur results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussion of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations.\n\n## Results of operations\n\nOur strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 67.5% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300millimeter production.\n\nOur focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $8.76 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $6.29 billion and represented 34.3% of revenue. During 2021, we returned $4.41 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.\n\n## Details of financial results - 2021 compared with 2020\n\nRevenue of $18.34 billion increased $3.88 billion, or 27%, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing.\n\nGross profit of $12.38 billion was up $3.11 billion, or 34%, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 67.5% from 64.1%.\n\nOperating expenses (R&amp;D and SG&amp;A) were $3.22 billion compared with $3.15 billion.\n\nAcquisition charges were $142 million compared with $198 million and were non-cash.\n\nRestructuring charges/other was $54 million due to integration charges at our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility partially offset by gains on sales of assets, compared with $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action in 2020.\n\nOperating profit was $8.96 billion, or 48.8% of revenue, compared with $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue.\n\nOther income and expense (OI&amp;E) was $143 million of income compared with $313 million of income, which decreased primarily due to lower royalty income. See Note 11 to the financial statements.\n\nOur provision for income taxes was $1.15 billion compared with $422 million. This increase was due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2020, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position.",

      "question": "How did NVIDIA's excess inventory levels in 2022 contribute to the changes in gross margin performance in 2023, particularly in light of increased inventory provisions and cancellation penalties?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA faced challenges with excess inventory due to long manufacturing lead times and uncertain demand forecasting, especially during transitions in cryptocurrency mining demand and supply chain disruptions. This led to inventory mismatches and the risk of write-downs. In 2023, these inventory issues directly impacted gross margins, as NVIDIA had to increase pricing programs, absorb cancellation penalties, and write down inventory, all of which negatively affected profitability. The company reported that these impacts were amplified by non-cancellable and non-returnable purchasing terms placed well in advance of historical lead times, and as a result, gross margins were pressured by both increased costs and reduced pricing flexibility.",

        "Hop 1: NVDA(2022) \u2192 Excess Inventory: NVIDIA highlighted long manufacturing lead times and demand volatility, leading to potential excess inventory and mismatched supply.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors',  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  related  Notes  thereto,  as  well  as  other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\n\n## Overview\n\n## Our Company and Our Businesses\n\nNVIDIA  pioneered  accelerated  computing  to  help  solve  the  most  challenging  computational  problems.  Since  our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled  by  the  sustained  demand  for  exceptional  3D  graphics  and  the  scale  of  the  gaming  market,  NVIDIA  has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, AR and VR.\n\nOur  two  operating  segments  are  \"Graphics\"  and  \"Compute  &amp;  Networking.\"  Refer  to  Note  17  of  the  Notes  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\n## Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\n\n## Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\n\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges  preventing  the  completion  of  the  transaction.  We  intend  to  record  in  operating  expenses  a  $1.36  billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020.\n\n## Demand\n\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions, time to market, transitions, competitor product releases and announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency  mining,  including  blockchain-based  platforms  such  as  Ethereum.  It  is  difficult  for  us  to  estimate  with  any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency  mining,  on  demand  for  our  products.  Volatility  in  the  cryptocurrency  market,  including  new  compute technologies,  price  changes  in  cryptocurrencies,  government  cryptocurrency  policies  and  regulations,  and  new cryptocurrency  standards  can  impact  and  have  impacted  in  the  past  cryptocurrency  demand,  and  further  impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase  returns  of  our  products  in  the  distribution  channel,  and  may  reduce  demand  for  our  new  GPUs.  We  have introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, nearly all our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to gamers. If attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to non-mining customers. We cannot  predict  whether  our  strategy  of  using  LHR  cards  and  CMP  will  achieve  our  desired  outcome.  Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and may have changed pre-pandemic behaviors, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the  future  on  both  a  global  and  regional  basis.  In  estimating  demand  and  evaluating  trends,  we  make  multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.\n\n## Supply\n\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers' future demand. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply  and  demand,  giving  rise  to  product  shortages  or  excess  inventory,  and  make  our  demand  forecast  more uncertain.

          "chunk_text": "We  often  partner  with  third-party  providers  for  certain  worker  services  and  we  may  provide  certain  limited  worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

      "question": "How did AMD's 'All Other' segment performance in 2022 influence its overall operating income outcome in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD's 'All Other' segment reported an operating loss of $4.979 billion, which was a significant drag on overall profitability. This segment, while not directly contributing to core business performance, includes unallocated expenses such as stock-based compensation and acquisition-related costs. In 2023, the 'All Other' segment improved to a $4.419 billion operating loss, indicating a reduction in these unallocated expenses. However, despite this improvement, AMD's total operating income declined from $1.264 billion in 2022 to $401 million in 2023. This suggests that while the 'All Other' segment became less of a burden year-over-year, broader challenges in other segments\u2014such as the sharp drop in Client segment operating income from $1.190 billion to a $46 million loss\u2014were more influential in driving the overall decline in operating performance.",

      "question": "Given Qualcomm's 2022 disclosures about risks from IP disputes impacting licensee sales, how does the 5% growth in QTL licensing revenues in fiscal 2024 reflect the company's exposure to these risks, especially in light of their historical dependency on licensee sales?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm disclosed significant risks related to intellectual property disputes that could negatively impact licensee sales, including potential injunctions, costly litigation, and disruptions in the supply chain\u2014all of which could reduce licensing revenues. These risks were particularly relevant given that QTL licensing revenues were directly impacted by licensee sales performance. In fiscal 2024 (reported in 2023), QTL revenues increased by 5%, primarily due to higher estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products. This growth suggests that, despite the risks outlined in 2022, Qualcomm either successfully mitigated these exposures or that the disputes did not materially disrupt licensee sales during this period. The 5% growth in QTL revenue indicates that the company\u2019s licensing model remained resilient, at least in the short term, and that the concerns about IP-related disruptions to licensee sales did not significantly materialize in fiscal 2024.",

These claims have resulted and may again result in our involvement in litigation, and we are currently involved in such litigation, including those described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may not prevail in such litigation given, among other factors, the complex technical issues and inherent uncertainties in intellectual property litigation. If any of our products were found to infringe another company's intellectual property, we could be subject to an injunction or be required to redesign our products, or to license such intellectual property or pay damages or other compensation to such other company (any of which could be costly). If we are unable to redesign our products, license such intellectual property used in our products or otherwise distribute our products (e.g., through a licensed supplier), we could be prohibited from making and selling our products. Similarly, our suppliers could be found to infringe another company's intellectual property, and such suppliers could then be enjoined from providing products or services to us.\n\nIn any potential dispute involving us and another company's patents or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, any such litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel and/or cause product release or shipment delays, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers' devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.\n\n## Our use of open source software may harm our business.\n\nCertain of our software and our suppliers' software may contain or may be derived from 'open source' software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products' source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers or license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing programs depends, may prove burdensome and timeconsuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property. Also, our use and our customers' use of open source software may subject our products and our customers' products to governmental and third-party scrutiny and delays in product certification, which could cause customers to view our products as less desirable than our competitors' products.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm expressed concern that Chinese OEMs were increasingly developing their own integrated circuit products, partly driven by the Made in China 2025 campaign aiming for 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025. This vertical integration risked reducing licensing revenues, which are critical to the QTL segment. By 2024, the QTL segment's revenue model remained heavily reliant on licensing royalties from mobile handset sales, with 'substantially all' of its revenue coming from such royalties. The continued exposure to licensing risks from Chinese OEMs suggests that the anticipated shift in OEM behavior had not yet been fully mitigated, leaving the QTL segment vulnerable to declining royalty payments as Chinese manufacturers increasingly adopt in-house chip solutions.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices.

The amount of revenues recognized during the year ended May 31, 2024 and 2023 that were included in the opening deferred revenues balance as of May 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively, was approximately $9.0 billion and $8.3 billion. Revenues recognized from performance obligations satisfied in prior periods and impairment losses recognized on our receivables were immaterial during each year ended May 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nRemaining performance obligations represent contracted revenues that had not yet been recognized, and include deferred revenues; invoices that have been i s s ued to customers but were uncollected and have not been recognized as revenues; and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenues in future periods. The volumes and amounts of customer contracts that we book and total revenues that we recognize are impacted by a variety of seasonal factors. In each fiscal year, the amounts and volumes of contracting activity and our total revenues are typically highest in our fourth fiscal quarter and lowest in our first fi s cal quarter. These seasonal impacts influence how our remaining performance obligations change over time and, combined with foreign exchange rate fl uctuations and other factors, influence the amount of remaining performance obligations that we report at a point in time. As of May 31, 2024, our remaining performance obligations were $97.9 billion, of which we expect to recognize approximately 39% as revenues over the next twelve months, 36% over the subsequent month 13 to month 36, 19% over the subsequent month 37 to month 60 and the remainder thereafter.\n\n## Sales of Financing Receivables\n\nWe offer certain of our customers the option to acquire certain of our cloud and license, hardware and services offerings through separate long-term payment contracts. We generally sell these contracts that we have financed for our customers on a non-recourse basis to financial institutions within 90 days of the contracts' dates of execution. We record the transfers of amounts due from customers to financial institutions as sales of financing receivables because we are considered to have surrendered control of these financing receivables. During fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022, $1.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, of our financing receivables were sold to financial institutions.\n\n## Business Combinations\n\nWe apply the provisions of ASC 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805), in accounting for our acquisitions. ASC 805 requires that we evaluate whether a transaction pertains to an acquisition of assets, or to an acquisition of a business. A business is defined as an integrated set of assets and activities that is capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. Asset acquisitions are accounted for by allocating the cost of the acquisition to the individual assets and liabilities assumed on a relative fair value basis; whereas the acquisition of a business requires us to recognize separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the acquisition date fair values. Goodwill as of the business acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. While we use our best estimates and assumptions to accurately value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the business acquisition date as well as any contingent consideration, where applicable, our estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement. As a result, during the measurement period, which may be up to one year from the business acquisition date, we record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Upon the conclusion of a business acquisition's measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed, whichever comes first, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to our consolidated statements of operations. Costs to exit or restructure certain activities of an acquired company or our internal operations are accounted for as termination and exit costs pursuant to ASC 420, Exit or Disposal Cost Obligations, and are accounted for separately from the business combination. A liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized and measured at its fair value in our consolidated statement of operations in the period in which the liability is incurred.",

      "question": "How did the contribution of QTL to QCOM's earnings before taxes (EBT) in 2022 compare to the unallocated EBT losses in 2024, and what does this reveal about the shift in financial performance dynamics between reportable and non-reportable segments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, QTL contributed $4,628 million to QCOM's earnings before taxes (EBT), demonstrating a strong positive impact from its licensing business. However, by 2024, QCOM reported unallocated EBT losses of $3,322 million, which included costs from nonreportable segments and unallocated expenses such as R&D ($2,277 million) and SG&A ($781 million). This shift indicates a growing financial burden from unallocated and nonreportable activities, which offset the historically strong performance of reportable segments like QTL. The entity chain (QCOM(2022) \u2192 QTL \u2192 EBT \u2190 QCOM(2024)) reveals a reversal in financial dynamics, where a previously profitable licensing segment could no longer compensate for rising unallocated costs in later years.",

        "Hop 1: QCOM(2022) \u2192 QTL: In 2022, QTL was a key reportable segment contributing $4,628 million to EBT.",

        "Hop 3: EBT \u2190 QCOM(2024): By 2024, QCOM's unallocated EBT showed a loss of $3,322 million, driven by rising unallocated R&D and SG&A costs."

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, certain share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development expenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. Our CODM does not evaluate our operating segments using discrete asset information.",

By 2024, the non-controlling interests tied to Mobileye decreased from $1,838 million as of Dec 30, 2023, to $1,672 million as of Dec 28, 2024, reflecting a reduction of $166 million. This indicates that Intel may have increased its controlling stake or consolidated more of Mobileye's equity over this period. Additionally, the changes in equity of non-controlling interest holders in Mobileye were $848 million in 2023 and $205 million in 2024, showing a significant decline in external equity adjustments.

By 2024, the Other segment reported $947 million in revenue and $505 million in operating profit, suggesting that despite the inclusion of environmental costs, the segment remained profitable.

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Intel reported total amortization expenses of $1,755 million, which included developed technology ($1,235 million), customer relationships and brands ($172 million), and licensed technology and patents ($348 million). By 2024, total amortization expenses decreased to $1,428 million, with developed technology dropping to $879 million. Notably, internal-use software emerged as a new amortization category in 2024, valued at $24 million. This shift suggests that Intel may have transitioned from relying heavily on externally developed or licensed technologies to investing in internally developed software solutions, which are now being amortized as part of their asset base. The decrease in developed technology amortization and the introduction of internal-use software indicate a strategic pivot toward building proprietary internal capabilities.",

      "question": "How did the change in QSI's contribution to earnings before taxes (EBT) from $104 million in 2024 compared to a $12 million loss in 2023 reflect Qualcomm's evolving strategic investment approach through its QSI segment?",
      "answer": "In 2023, QSI reported a loss of $12 million in EBT, indicating that its strategic investments were not contributing positively to profitability during that year. By 2024, QSI's EBT contribution improved significantly to $104 million, showing a turnaround in the performance of its strategic investments. This shift from a loss to a positive contribution highlights a strategic evolution in how Qualcomm managed or selected its investments through QSI, aligning them more effectively with profitability goals. This evolution in QSI\u2019s impact on EBT demonstrates a meaningful change in the role of strategic investments within Qualcomm\u2019s broader financial performance.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMD's All Other category included $258 million of acquisition-related and other costs, contributing to an operating loss of $4.4 billion. These costs primarily included transaction costs, purchase price adjustments for inventory, and workforce rebalancing charges. By 2024, the All Other category continued to include acquisition-related and other costs, but with expanded components such as restructuring charges. This evolution suggests a shift in AMD's cost structure, where acquisition-related expenses were not only maintained but also integrated with broader restructuring efforts, potentially signaling ongoing integration activities from the Xilinx acquisition and possibly new strategic realignments.",

This indicates a weakening performance trajectory for the Embedded Processing segment over this period, despite stable reported revenue of $3,368 million in 2023 compared to $3,261 million in 2022.

      "question": "What does the shift from a $279 million EBT loss in 2022 to a $104 million EBT gain in 2024 for the QSI segment suggest about the effectiveness of Qualcomm's strategic investment approach and its broader implications for earnings stability?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm's QSI segment contributed a $279 million loss to earnings before taxes (EBT), indicating that its strategic investments were underperforming or required significant capital outlays without immediate returns. By 2024, this had reversed to a $104 million positive contribution to EBT, suggesting a significant turnaround in the performance of these strategic initiatives. This shift implies that Qualcomm likely refined its investment strategy, realized gains from earlier investments, or aligned QSI more closely with core business objectives. Given that QSI is a reportable segment evaluated based on EBT, this transformation reflects improved strategic execution and could signal enhanced earnings stability, especially as unallocated corporate expenses and other volatile items remained relatively controlled during this period.",

        "Hop 1: QCOM(2022) \u2192 QSI: Qualcomm disclosed that QSI is a reportable segment focused on strategic investments, and in 2022 it contributed a $279 million loss to EBT.",

        "Hop 3: EBT \u2190 QCOM(2024): By 2024, QSI had turned positive, contributing $104 million to EBT, reflecting a material improvement in its financial performance."

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, certain share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development expenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. Our CODM does not evaluate our operating segments using discrete asset information.",

By 2023, this shifted to a $10M gain under 'Other Losses Gains' (QCOM_10k_2023.pdf), suggesting a partial recovery or change in investment positioning. The ORCL_10k_2022.pdf shows that other companies also experienced volatility in similar categories, with 'Other (losses) gains, net' swinging from positive to negative, reinforcing that this is a sector-wide sensitivity to macroeconomic and market conditions.

      "answer": "The QTL segment revenue increased marginally from $731M in 2022 to $734M in 2023 despite significant risks in 2022 around reliance on a limited number of Chinese OEM licensees whose reduced sales or pricing pressures could adversely impact licensing revenues. This slight increase suggests that while QCOM faced known risks related to licensee concentration and potential vertical integration by key customers, the licensing model under QTL remained relatively stable year-over-year, with minimal growth likely offsetting some of the anticipated risks.",

        "Hop 1: QCOM(2022) \u2192 Licensing Revenues: Licensing revenues were identified as a risk due to concentration in a few Chinese OEMs, with potential for adverse impact if these licensees failed to meet obligations or if sales declined.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2021, Adobe reported strong subscription revenue growth driven by Digital Media, particularly Creative and Document Cloud offerings, with Document Cloud seeing strong new user acquisition and Creative benefiting from a growing subscription base. This early growth trajectory is reflected in the 2024 results, where total subscription revenue reached $4.86 billion, up 12% from $4.33 billion in fiscal 2023. The 2024 performance also shows continued strength in Document Cloud, which grew by 18% to $3.18 billion, suggesting that the early gains in subscription adoption helped fuel long-term revenue growth. However, the 2024 filing notes macroeconomic pressures that could affect future predictability, indicating that while the foundation from earlier growth remains strong, external factors may influence the sustainability of this trajectory.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Analog segment's cost of revenue was unspecified, though it was a major contributor to the company's total cost of revenue of $6.5 billion. In 2024, the Analog segment directly accounted for $4.869 billion of the total $6.547 billion cost of revenue, representing approximately 74.4% of the total. This suggests that the Analog segment remained the dominant driver of cost of revenue in 2024, with its cost structure remaining proportionally stable despite a slight increase in its share compared to the prior year. This stability in cost contribution, despite a marginal decline in total revenue from $17.519 billion (2023) to $15.641 billion (2024), indicates that the Analog segment continued to carry the largest cost burden and remained central to TXN's manufacturing and production footprint.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TXN(2023) \u2192 Analog Segment: TXN explicitly identifies Analog as one of its two core segments, responsible for Power and Signal Chain semiconductor products, and notes that manufacturing costs are allocated to segments on a per-unit basis.",
        "Hop 2: Analog Segment \u2192 Cost of Revenue: The Analog segment is a major contributor to cost of revenue due to its manufacturing-intensive nature, as reflected in its significant share of expenses in 2024.",
        "Hop 3: Cost of Revenue \u2190 TXN(2024): In 2024, the Analog segment accounted for $4.869 billion out of the total $6.547 billion in cost of revenue, or about 74.4%, showing its dominant role in the company\u2019s cost structure."

      "answer": "The consistent inclusion of licensing gains\u2014$34 million in 2023 and an unquantified but still-present amount in 2024\u2014within the All Other category suggests that these non-recurring or irregular gains are deliberately excluded from AMD's reportable segment results. This implies that investors should interpret segment profitability with the understanding that such gains do not reflect core operational performance but may influence overall financial health. The All Other category also contains other non-segment items like amortization, stock-based compensation, and restructuring charges, indicating that AMD and its CODM focus on segment results stripped of these volatile elements when evaluating business performance.",

By 2023, the Analog segment had a cost of revenue of $4,615M, which represents the ongoing operational expenses directly tied to generating $13,040M in revenue. This trajectory suggests that the segment has grown beyond its historical goodwill base, with current operations requiring greater resource investment to sustain revenue generation.

      "answer": "In 2022, TXN's Other segment included asset dispositions as part of its non-operational, corporate-level items, but no specific revenue or financial impact from these dispositions was disclosed. By 2024, the Other segment still included gains and losses from asset dispositions among its non-core items; however, the segment reported a total revenue of $947 million. While the exact financial impact of asset dispositions in 2024 is not quantified, their continued inclusion in the Other segment suggests that they remained a secondary, non-core activity. The lack of specific disposition-related figures in both years indicates that these events were not material enough to be reported separately from other corporate-level items, even as the segment's overall revenue became explicitly quantified in 2024.",

      "question": "How did the growth in Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment revenue from 2023 ($21.563 billion) to 2024 ($23.117 billion) correlate with the company's strategic focus on Server Products and Cloud Services, particularly in light of the reported $137.4 billion Microsoft Cloud revenue in fiscal 2024?",
      "answer": "Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment revenue grew from $21.563 billion in 2023 to $23.117 billion in 2024, reflecting a strategic emphasis on Server Products and Cloud Services. Internally, the Intelligent Cloud segment is defined to include Azure and other cloud services, along with server products like SQL Server and Windows Server. The 2024 report highlights that Microsoft Cloud revenue\u2014which includes Azure and other cloud services\u2014reached $137.4 billion in fiscal 2024, up from $111.6 billion in 2023. This significant increase indicates that the growth in the Intelligent Cloud segment was driven by the broader expansion of Microsoft Cloud, which is anchored in the Server Products and Cloud Services sub-domain. Thus, the evolution of the Intelligent Cloud segment's performance is directly tied to the company's deepening stake in cloud infrastructure and services.",

      "question": "How did the changes in TXN's Analog segment performance from 2022 to 2024 influence the company's overall operating profit trajectory, especially in light of shifts in gross profit margins and R&D investment levels?",
      "answer": "In 2022, TXN's Analog segment contributed significantly to the company's revenue, with strong gross profit margins and relatively lower R&D investment. By 2024, the Analog segment's revenue stood at $12.161 billion, with a gross profit of $7.292 billion, translating to a gross profit margin of approximately 60%. This marked a decline in gross profit margin compared to 2022, as the company increased its R&D investment from $1.411 billion in 2022 to $1.959 billion in 2024. This increased R&D spending, while reducing short-term operating profit, likely aimed to drive long-term innovation and segment performance. Consequently, TXN's overall operating profit declined from $10.140 billion in 2022 to $5.465 billion in 2024, reflecting both the impact of the Analog segment's evolving performance and the strategic reinvestment in R&D.",

No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2021 or 2019.\n\n## 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar and share amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are presented in millions unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods' financial statements to conform to the 2021 presentation.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary.\n\n## Significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, and recognize revenue when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products.\n\nRevenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products' disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products.\n\nThe revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns , incentives and credit losses. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.\n\n## Advertising costs\n\nWe expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $27 million, $28 million and $30 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\n## Other assessed taxes\n\nSome transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.",

      "answer": "In both 2022 and 2024, Texas Instruments disclosed litigation expenses as part of the 'Other' segment, indicating that the company maintained a consistent accounting and reporting structure for these costs. However, no specific dollar figures or percentages for litigation expenses were disclosed in either year, limiting visibility into the magnitude or trend of legal costs. This lack of granular data means that while the structure of expense reporting remained unchanged, we cannot definitively determine whether legal risk exposure increased, decreased, or remained stable between 2022 and 2024. The absence of explicit figures suggests a potential gap in reporting transparency, as stakeholders are unable to assess the financial impact of litigation on the company's performance over this period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, TXN's Other Segment included $257 million in integration charges, which were among the items not used in evaluating segment performance or allocating resources. These charges were part of the broader set of corporate-level expenses that were allocated to operating segments using methodologies such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount. By 2023, integration charges had dropped to $0, indicating a strategic shift in how TXN managed and accounted for such costs. This change suggests that TXN may have either completed prior integration efforts or decided to handle these costs outside of the standard allocation framework, potentially reducing the burden on operating segments and streamlining financial evaluation processes.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, ADBE's Document Cloud ARR was $2.81 billion, up from $2.28 billion in fiscal 2022, contributing to a total Digital Media ARR of $15.17 billion. By fiscal 2024, the Digital Media ARR continued to be defined as the sum of Creative ARR and Document Cloud ARR, indicating that Document Cloud remained a core component of the segment. The continued inclusion of Document Cloud ARR in Digital Media ARR from 2023 to 2024 shows that its growth trajectory persisted, supporting the overall expansion of Digital Media ARR to $15.33 billion (currency-adjusted) by the end of fiscal 2023. This suggests that Document Cloud was not only a stable contributor but also a meaningful growth engine within the broader Digital Media segment.",

      "question": "How did Intel's reorganization of the Data Center and AI segment in 2024 impact its overall operating income trajectory, given the segment's significant operating loss in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Intel's Data Center and AI segment reported an operating loss of $530 million, contributing to a total operating income of only $93 million for the company. This represented a sharp decline from the segment\u2019s $1.3 billion operating income in 2022. In 2024, Intel reorganized the Data Center and AI segment, which led to a reallocation of assets and resources \u2014 specifically, a $292 million transfer out of the segment. This reorganization may reflect strategic efforts to address the declining performance and stabilize the segment\u2019s contribution to overall operating income. However, the segment\u2019s value was reduced to $8.721 billion from $9.013 billion in 2023, suggesting continued financial pressure.",

        "Hop 2: Total Operating Income \u2192 Data Center and AI: The Data Center and AI segment went from a $1.3 billion operating income in 2022 to a $530 million loss in 2023, making it a key driver of the company\u2019s overall operating income decline.",
        "Hop 3: Data Center and AI \u2190 INTC(2024): In 2024, Intel reorganized the Data Center and AI segment, transferring $292 million out, reducing its total value from $9.013 billion to $8.721 billion, signaling strategic adjustments in response to the segment\u2019s poor performance in 2023."

      "question": "How did the increase in Qualcomm's Licensing Revenues from $5,306 million in 2023 to $5,572 million in 2024 reflect the performance and strategic role of the QTL Segment, given that the segment's revenues are primarily recognized over time from royalties tied to mobile handset sales?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm's QTL Segment was defined by its focus on licensing revenues, which are recognized over time and primarily derived from royalties linked to mobile handset sales. By 2024, Licensing Revenues had increased from $5,306 million in 2023 to $5,572 million, representing a $266 million growth. This increase indicates that the QTL Segment remained a stable and growing contributor to Qualcomm\u2019s revenue, despite the long-term nature of its revenue recognition model. The growth in Licensing Revenues suggests either an increase in the volume of licensed devices or potentially higher royalty rates, reflecting the segment's sustained strategic importance and its role in Qualcomm\u2019s broader revenue mix.",

        "Hop 1: QCOM(2022) \u2192 QTL Segment: In 2022, Qualcomm identified the QTL Segment as primarily focused on licensing revenues derived from royalties on mobile handset sales.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Analog segment contributed $8,359M to TXN's total operating profit of $10,140M, reflecting strong profitability with a gross profit of $10,749M. By 2024, based on 2023 performance data, the segment's operating profit contribution decreased to $5,821M out of $7,331M total, despite maintaining a high gross profit of $8,425M. This decline in operating profit margin (from ~78% in 2022 to ~69% in 2023) suggests that while the Analog segment remains strategically significant with a substantial $4,158M goodwill allocation in 2022, its profitability growth has slowed, potentially signaling challenges in sustaining earlier performance levels.",

The lack of specific environmental cost disclosures in 2024 makes it difficult to quantify their exact impact, but the significant gross margin suggests that TXN may have managed these costs effectively or that they were relatively stable year-over-year despite the revenue decline.",

By 2024, QSI's revenue had declined further to $18 million, but the EBT improved to $104 million, showing a turnaround in profitability. This shift suggests that while QCOM reduced its revenue-generating activities within QSI, it simultaneously improved the segment's cost structure or investment focus, leading to a positive earnings outcome.

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

These pressures carried over into 2024, where the QTL segment\u2014responsible for substantially all licensing revenues\u2014remained heavily reliant on royalty income from licensees' sales of mobile handsets. Despite these challenges, QTL continued to operate under a licensing model that recognized revenues over time, indicating a strategic decision to maintain the status quo despite external pressures.

By 2024, the Other Segment reported $947 million in revenue and continued to include asset dispositions in its disclosures, alongside DLP products, calculators, and custom ASICs. While both years treated asset dispositions as part of corporate-level items not used in segment evaluation, the 2024 disclosure added specificity by quantifying the segment's overall revenue, which was not provided in 2023. This evolution reflects a more detailed financial presentation in 2024 without a change in how asset dispositions were categorized within the Other Segment.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, ACN's U.S. Plans had a debt securities allocation of 97%, which was slightly below the 2023 target allocation of 100%. This near-complete allocation to debt securities likely contributed to lower expected returns on plan assets compared to equity-heavy portfolios. According to sensitivity analysis, a 25 basis point change in the expected long-term rate of return on assets could shift pension expense by $445, indicating high sensitivity. By 2024, pension expense had increased to $222,891, up from $188,001 in 2022, suggesting that either returns on assets underperformed expectations or interest rate assumptions changed, despite the stable debt-heavy asset allocation strategy.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco faced significant supply constraints due to component shortages, particularly from China's pandemic-related lockdowns, which led to increased inventory and purchase commitments to meet customer demand. This created a risk of material excess and obsolete inventory charges if demand fell short of expectations. In 2023, these inventory risks were reflected in gross margin pressures, as the company noted increased exposure to excess and obsolete inventories under unfavorable economic conditions. The 2022 supply chain challenges directly contributed to the 2023 margin volatility, showing how inventory decisions made under uncertainty can cascade into future financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nof that supply, and our ability to meet customer demand for our products if we cannot secure sufficient supply in a timely manner. We continue to manage through significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages, including significant constraints  with  certain  critical  components  which  prevents  us  from  completing  manufacturing  of  certain  of  our  products.  For example, we saw an additional unanticipated supply challenge with COVID-19 related lockdowns in certain parts of China in the second half of fiscal 2022 that resulted in a severe shortage of certain critical components. While we did see some easing of the industry-wide supply constraints towards the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we expect such constraints to continue and the duration of which is uncertain. Additionally, we may in the future experience a shortage of certain component parts as a result of our own manufacturing issues, manufacturing issues at our suppliers or contract manufacturers, capacity problems experienced by our  suppliers  or  contract  manufacturers  including  capacity  or  cost  problems  resulting  from  industry  consolidation,  or  strong demand for those parts. Growth in the economy is likely to create greater pressures on us and our suppliers to accurately project overall component demand and component demands within specific product categories and to establish optimal component levels and manufacturing capacity, especially for labor-intensive components, components for which we purchase a substantial portion of the supply, or the re-ramping of manufacturing capacity for highly complex products. During periods of shortages or delays the price of components may increase, or the components may not be available at all, and we may also encounter shortages if we do not accurately anticipate our needs. We may not be able to secure enough components at reasonable prices or of acceptable quality to build  new  products  in  a  timely  manner  in  the  quantities  or  configurations  needed. Accordingly,  our  revenue  and  gross  margins could suffer until other sources can be developed.\n\nOur operating results would also be adversely affected if, anticipating greater demand than actually develops, we commit to the purchase of more components than we need, which is more likely to occur in a period of demand uncertainties such as we are currently experiencing. There can be no assurance that we will not encounter these problems in the future. Although in many cases we use standard parts and components for our products, certain components are presently available only from a single source or limited  sources,  and  a  global  economic  downturn  and  related  market  uncertainty  could  negatively  impact  the  availability  of components from one or more of these sources, especially during times such as we have recently seen when there are supplier constraints based on labor and other actions taken during economic downturns. We may not be able to diversify sources in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to deliver products to customers and seriously impact present and future sales.\n\nWe believe that we may be faced with the following challenges in the future: new markets in which we participate may grow quickly,  which  may  make  it  difficult  to  quickly  obtain  significant  component  capacity;  as  we  acquire  companies  and  new technologies, we may be dependent on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners; and we face competition for certain components that are supply-constrained, from existing competitors, and companies in other markets.\n\nManufacturing capacity and component supply constraints could continue to be significant issues for us. We purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our products. During the normal  course  of  business,  in  order  to  improve  manufacturing  lead-time  performance  and  to  help  ensure  adequate  component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or that establish the parameters defining our requirements. In certain instances, these agreements allow us the option to cancel, reschedule, and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to firm orders being placed. When facing  component  supply-related  challenges  we  have  increased  our  efforts  in  procuring  components  in  order  to  meet  customer expectations, which in turn contributes to an increase in inventory and purchase commitments. In recent periods, we increased our inventory and purchase commitments in light of the significant supply constraints seen industry-wide due to component shortages, caused in part  by  the  COVID-19 pandemic. These increases in our inventory and purchase commitments to shorten lead times could also lead to material excess and obsolete inventory charges in future periods if the demand for our products is less than our expectations.  If  we  fail  to  anticipate  customer  demand  properly,  an  oversupply  of  parts  could  result  in  excess  or  obsolete components that could adversely affect our gross margins. For additional information and a further discussion of current impacts and  risks  related  to  our  significant  supply  constraints,  inventory  commitments  and  our  purchase  commitments  with  contract manufacturers and suppliers, see Results of Operations-Product Gross Margin-Supply Constraints Impacts and Risks, Liquidity and Capital Resources-Inventory Supply Chain and Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## We expect gross margin to vary over time, and our level of product gross margin may not be sustainable.\n\nOur level of product gross margins declined in fiscal 2022 and have declined in certain prior periods on a year-over-year basis, and could decline in future periods due to adverse impacts from various factors, including:\n\n- Changes in customer, geographic, or product mix, including mix of configurations within each product group\n- Introduction  of  new  products,  including  products  with  price-performance  advantages,  and  new  business  models including the transformation of our business to deliver more software and subscription offerings",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AVGO disclosed an expected term of 4.8 years for stock awards, with a volatility of 32.8% and a dividend yield of 3.3%. By 2024, the expected term decreased to 3.6 years, while volatility slightly dropped to 32.0% and the dividend yield also decreased to 1.7%. This reduction in expected term suggests that AVGO anticipated a shorter time for employees to exercise stock options, potentially due to changes in employee behavior or strategic compensation adjustments. The change in expected term would have directly impacted the calculated fair value of stock awards, as the expected term is a key input in the valuation model, especially when paired with the volatility and dividend yield assumptions referenced in the 2024 filing.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm identified a risk that lower average selling prices of licensees\u2019 mobile handsets could reduce royalty payments, negatively impacting licensing revenues. This concern was grounded in the fact that the QTL segment primarily recognized revenue through these royalties. By 2024, Qualcomm still showed a continued stake in the QTL segment, which continued to generate licensing revenues largely from the same royalty model. This suggests that despite the acknowledged risk in 2022, Qualcomm maintained strategic confidence in its licensing framework, likely due to its entrenched market position and ongoing licensing agreements with major handset manufacturers. The persistence of QTL as a core segment indicates a strategic decision to rely on the licensing model, even in the face of potential market volatility.",

In addition, reductions in the average selling prices of our licensees' products, unless offset by an increase in volumes, would generally decrease total royalties payable to us, negatively impacting our licensing revenues.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO PRODUCT DEFECTS OR SECURITY VULNERABILITIES\n\n## Failures in our products, or in the products of our customers or licensees, including those resulting from security vulnerabilities, defects or errors, could harm our business.\n\nOur products are complex and may contain defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, or experience failures or unsatisfactory performance, due to any number of issues, including issues in materials, design, fabrication, packaging and/or use within a system. Development of products in new domains of technology, and the migration to integrated circuit technologies with smaller geometric feature sizes, increases complexity and adds risk to manufacturing yields and reliability, and increases the likelihood of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities. Defects, errors, security vulnerabilities or other unintended functionality could also be introduced into our products by cyber-attacks or other actions by malicious actors, either directly or through third-party products or software used in our products or IT infrastructure (including applications). Further, because of the complexity of our products, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities might only be detected when the products are in use. Risks associated with product or technology defects, errors or security vulnerabilities are exacerbated by the fact that our customers typically integrate our products into consumer and other devices.\n\nThe use of devices containing our products to interact with untrusted systems or otherwise access untrusted content creates a risk of exposing the system hardware and software in those devices to malicious attacks. Further, security vulnerabilities in our products or the technologies we use could expose our customers, or end users of our customers' products, to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy malware that could attack our products or our customers' products or IT infrastructure. Such attacks could result in the disruption of our customers' businesses or the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure, loss or destruction of the technology or intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of our customers, their employees or the end users of our customers' devices. While we continue to focus on this issue and take measures to safeguard our products from cybersecurity threats, device capabilities continue to evolve, enabling more elaborate functionality and applications, and increasing the risk of security failures, and techniques used to perpetrate cybersecurity attacks are increasingly sophisticated and constantly evolving. See also the Risk Factor titled ' Our business and operations could suffer in the event of security breaches of our IT systems, or other misappropriation of our technology, intellectual property or other proprietary or confidential information .'\n\nOur products may be responsible for critical functions in our customers' products and networks. Failure of our products to perform to specifications, meet certain regulatory or industry standards (including product safety and information security standards, which may differ by region, geography and industry, and which are particularly stringent in the automotive industry), or other product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities, could lead to substantial damage to the products we sell to our customers, the devices into which our products are integrated and the end users of such devices, and potentially to our customers' IT infrastructure. Such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities could give rise to significant costs, including costs related to developing solutions, recalling products, repairing or replacing defective products, writing down defective inventory or indemnification obligations under our agreements, and could result in the loss of sales and divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products could result in failure to achieve market acceptance, a loss of design wins, a shifting of business to our competitors, and litigation or regulatory action against us, and could harm our reputation, our relationships with customers and partners and our ability to attract new customers, as well as the perceptions of our brand. Other potential adverse impacts of product defects, errors or security vulnerabilities include shipment delays, write-offs of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, and losses on unfavorable purchase commitments. In addition, defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in the products of our customers or licensees could cause a delay or decrease in demand for the products into which our products are integrated, and thus for our products.\n\nIn addition, the occurrence of defects, errors or security vulnerabilities may give rise to product liability claims, particularly if such defects, errors or security vulnerabilities in our products or the technology we use, or the products into which they are integrated, result in personal injury or death, and could result in significant costs, expenses and losses. If a product liability claim is brought against us, the cost of defending the claim could be significant, and could divert the attention of our technical and management personnel and harm our business, even if we are successful. We may be named in product liability claims even if there is no evidence that our products caused the damage in question, and even though we may have indemnity from our customers, and such claims could result in significant costs and expenses. We may also be required to indemnify and/or defend our customers from product liability claims relating to our products. Further, our business liability insurance may be inadequate, may not cover the claims, and future coverage may be unavailable on acceptable terms, which could adversely impact our financial results. The above is exacerbated by the fact that our products may be used, and perform critical functions, in various high-risk applications such as: automobiles, including ADAS/AD functions; cameras and artificial intelligence, including home and enterprise security; home automation, including smoke and noxious gas detectors; medical condition monitoring; location and asset tracking and management, including wearables for child safety and elderly health; robotics, including public safety drones and autonomous municipality vehicles; and extended reality (XR) for treatment of phobias or PTSD, early detection of disorders or special needs, among others.",

This pattern persisted into 2024, where the EMEA segment again saw gross margin growth from the same factors, indicating a consistent trend of operational efficiency gains and services strength in the region. The recurring mention of 'higher services gross margin' in both years suggests that Cisco's strategic focus on services in EMEA delivered sustained margin improvements across both reporting periods.",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G.

      "question": "How did the increase in AMD's licensing gain from $34 million in 2023 to $48 million in 2024, driven by royalty income from the THATIC JV, reflect the evolution of their IP licensing agreement and its financial contribution to operating income?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMD reported a licensing gain of $34 million from royalty income associated with its IP licensing agreement with the THATIC JV. By 2024, this figure increased to $48 million, indicating a $14 million year-over-year growth in licensing revenue. This growth reflects a favorable evolution in the IP licensing relationship, despite the U.S. government's Entity List designation of THATIC and the THATIC JV since June 2019. AMD continues to receive royalty income based on the sales of THATIC JV's products developed using AMD's licensed IP, and this income is classified as Licensing Gain within operating income. The increase in licensing gain suggests either higher product sales by the THATIC JV or improved contractual royalty terms, contributing more significantly to AMD's financial performance in 2024 compared to 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD(2023) \u2192 Licensing Gain: AMD reported $34 million in licensing gain from royalty income linked to the THATIC JV in 2023.",

        "Hop 3: Royalty Income \u2190 AMD(2024): In 2024, AMD recognized $48 million in licensing gain, showing an increase of $14 million, which reflects a stronger contribution from the royalty income stream."

      "answer": "In 2022, TXN's Analog segment did not disclose its specific contribution to the total cost of revenue, suggesting that such granular cost allocation was not reported. By 2024, the Analog segment's cost of revenue was explicitly reported at $4,869 million, accounting for 74.4% of the company's total cost of revenue ($6,547 million). This represents a significant shift in cost structure, with the Analog segment becoming the dominant cost driver. This evolution indicates a strategic or operational change where the segment's operations have grown in scale or complexity relative to other business units, potentially impacting gross profit margins, which declined from $13,771 million in 2022 to $9,094 million in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Major customer\n\nOne of our end customers accounted for 9%, 10% and 8% of revenue in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, recognized primarily in our Analog segment. No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2021 or 2019.\n\n## 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar and share amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are presented in millions unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods' financial statements to conform to the 2021 presentation.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary.\n\n## Significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, and recognize revenue when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products.\n\nRevenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products' disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products.\n\nThe revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns , incentives and credit losses. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.\n\n## Advertising costs\n\nWe expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $27 million, $28 million and $30 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\n## Other assessed taxes\n\nSome transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.",

      "question": "How did the inclusion of litigation expenses in the Other segment change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about TXN's corporate-level cost management and segment reporting strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, TXN's Other segment included litigation expenses as part of its corporate-level items, indicating a consistent approach to segment reporting where such non-operational costs were excluded from performance evaluation (Hop 1). In 2024, the Other segment again explicitly listed litigation expenses among corporate-level items not used in evaluating segment performance, maintaining alignment with the prior year\u2019s methodology (Hop 3). The fact that Other generated $947 million in revenue in 2024 (Hop 2) suggests that despite the ongoing inclusion of litigation expenses in this segment, TXN maintained a stable reporting structure, even as the segment grew in financial significance. This consistency in cost allocation implies that TXN did not materially alter its segment reporting or cost management strategy between 2023 and 2024.",

        "Hop 1: TXN(2023) \u2192 Other Segment: In 2023, TXN disclosed that litigation expenses were included in the Other segment and were not used in evaluating segment results or allocating resources.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments.

Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

This loss negatively impacted non-operating expenses. In 2023, Oracle continued to disclose equity investment losses as part of non-operating expenses, with an emphasis on losses from equity method investments like Ampere. The persistence of these losses suggests that Oracle's equity investment strategy did not yield improved financial results year-over-year and continued to exert downward pressure on profitability. The shift from a disclosed dollar figure in 2022 to a qualitative emphasis on ongoing losses in 2023 may reflect a strategic decision to continue holding underperforming investments or a broader challenge in achieving returns on strategic equity bets.",

      "question": "How did the changes in ACN's postretirement medical plan obligations from 2023 to 2024 impact the recognition of prior service costs, and what does this indicate about the company's pension strategy adjustments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ACN reported a prior service cost of $467 million related to its postretirement medical plans, which contributed to a total accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCI) of $657 million for those plans. By 2024, the prior service cost arising during the period had decreased significantly to $307 million, indicating a reduction in new obligations being added to the plan. This decline in prior service costs, against a backdrop of an overall increase in the defined benefit plans' ending balance from $226,503 million in 2023 to $254,172 million in 2024, suggests that ACN may have taken steps to limit future liabilities by freezing or modifying benefits in the postretirement medical plan. The evolving relationship between the postretirement medical plans and prior service costs reflects a strategic shift in managing long-term employee benefit obligations.",

      "question": "How did the treatment and disclosure of asset dispositions within the 'Other' segment evolve from TXN's 2023 to 2024 filings, and what does this imply about the company's strategic focus on non-core activities?",
      "answer": "In TXN's 2023 filing, asset dispositions were included in the 'Other' segment and described as part of corporate-level items such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and restructuring charges. The 2024 filing maintains this treatment, explicitly reinforcing that asset dispositions remain part of the 'Other' segment. However, the 2024 filing adds clarity by emphasizing that the CODM evaluates segments based on revenue growth, gross margin, and operating profit, and that items like asset dispositions are excluded from this evaluation. This evolution in disclosure language suggests that TXN is sharpening its strategic focus on core performance metrics while maintaining transparency around non-core activities. The continuity in placement within 'Other' indicates that asset dispositions remain peripheral to segment-level strategy.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

      "question": "How did the significant decline in NVDA's net cash provided by (used in) investing activities from $7,375 million in 2023 to -$10,566 million in 2024 relate to the increased exposure to investment losses, particularly in light of NVDA's 2024 disclosures about market and credit risks impacting their investment portfolio?",
      "answer": "NVDA's net cash provided by investing activities declined sharply from $7,375 million in 2023 to -$10,566 million in 2024, indicating a substantial shift from cash inflows to outflows in this category. This change coincided with increased exposure to investment losses, as highlighted in NVDA's 2024 disclosures, which warned of general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks affecting their investment portfolio. These risks were particularly relevant given that a majority of NVDA's investments were in U.S. government securities, which could be impacted by market downturns or a potential downgrade of the U.S. government's credit rating. The negative impact of these investment losses on NVDA's financial position in 2024 was thus closely tied to the broader deterioration in cash flows from investing activities observed between 2023 and 2024.",

These investments are subject to general credit, liquidity , market and interest rate risks, which may be exacerbated by market downturns or events that affect global financial markets, as described above. A  majority of our investment portfolio comprises USG securities. A  decline in global financial markets for long periods or a downgrade of the USG credit rating due to an actual or threatened default on government debt could result in higher interest rates, a decline in the value of the U.S. dollar, reduced market liquidity or other adverse conditions. These factors could cause an unrealized or realized loss position in our investments or require us to record impairment charges.\n\n## International sales and operations are a significant part of our business, which exposes us to risks that could harm our business.\n\nWe  sell  our  products  internationally ,  and  we  also  have  operations  and  conduct  business  internationally .  Our  semiconductor  wafers  are  manufactured, assembled, tested and packaged by third parties located outside of the United States, and we generated 53% of our revenue in fiscal year 2025 from sales outside the United States. The market in China, where our offerings are limited by export controls, is highly competitive and we expect it to remain competitive going forward. The global nature of our business subjects us to a number of risks and uncertainties, which have had in the past and could in the future have a material  adverse  effect  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations.  These  include  domestic  and  international  economic  and  political conditions in countries in which we and our suppliers and manufacturers do business, government lockdowns to control case spread of global or local health issues, differing legal standards with respect to protection of IP and employment practices, different domestic and international business and cultural practices, disruptions to capital markets, counter-inflation policies, currency fluctuations, natural disasters, acts of war or other military actions, terrorism, public health issues, restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs, sanctions, and other controls on imports or exports, and catastrophic events.\n\n## Product, system security , and data protection incidents or breaches, as well as cyber-attacks, could disrupt our operations, reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, and significantly harm our business and reputation.\n\nSecurity breaches, computer malware, social-engineering attacks, denial-of-service attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, and other cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated, making it more difficult to successfully detect, defend against them or implement adequate preventative measures.\n\nCyber-attacks, including ransomware attacks by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, may become more prevalent and severe. Our ability to recover from ransomware attacks may be limited if our backups have been affected by the attack, or if restore from backups is delayed or not feasible.\n\nIndividuals, groups of hackers and sophisticated organizations, including nation-states and nation-state-supported actors, and other threat actors have engaged and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks. A dditionally , some actors are using A I technology to launch more automated, targeted and coordinated attacks. Due to geopolitical conflicts and during times of war or other major conflicts, we and the third parties we rely upon may be subject to a heightened risk of cyber-attacks  that  could  materially  disrupt  our  ability   to  prov ide  serv ices  and  products.  W e  may   also  face  cy bersecurity   threats  due  to  error  or  intentional misconduct by employees, contractors or other third-party service providers.  Certain aspects of effective cybersecurity are dependent upon our employees, contractors  and/or  other  third-party  service  providers  safeguarding  our  sensitive  information  and  adhering  to  our  security  policies  and  access  control mechanisms. We have in the past experienced, and may in the future experience, security incidents arising from a failure to properly handle sensitive information or adhere to our security policies and access control mechanisms, including, for example, employees posting company data on third-party websites without permission, and, although no such events have had a material adverse effect on our business, there can be no assurance that an insider threat or error will not result in an incident that is material to us or lead to negative publicity . Furthermore, we rely on products and services provided by third-party suppliers to operate certain critical business systems, including without limitation, cloud-based infrastructure, encryption and authentication technology , employee email and other functions, which exposes us to",

      "answer": "In 2023, Adobe's Creative ARR was $12.37 billion, contributing to a total Digital Media ARR of $15.17 billion. Since Digital Media ARR includes both Creative ARR and Document Cloud ARR, the growth in Creative ARR (from $10.98 billion in 2022 to $12.37 billion in 2023) directly influenced the overall Digital Media ARR growth. By 2024, the structure of Digital Media ARR remained consistent, continuing to include Creative ARR as a core component. However, the updated Creative ARR figure in 2024 would determine the new Digital Media ARR total, indicating whether the growth trajectory observed in 2023 continued or shifted. This compositional relationship shows how Creative ARR growth continues to be a key driver of Adobe\u2019s broader Digital Media segment performance.",

These leases were part of Cisco's broader financing receivables, which included loans and service contracts. By 2023, Cisco reported that the allowance for credit losses on lease receivables decreased from $23 million in fiscal year 2022 to $19 million in fiscal year 2023, despite a $1 million reduction in provisions during the year. This decrease suggests an improvement in the credit quality or risk profile of the lease receivables tied to sales-type leases, potentially due to better collateral management or tighter underwriting standards over the 12-month period.",

We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020 which represents 24% yearover-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021 from $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Workfront's workflow platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.\n\n## COVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess,  conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As  a  result,  we  have  reopened  our  offices  in  areas  with  sustained  low  infection  rates  and  are  allowing  fully  vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.\n\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021\n\nOur financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion  in  fiscal  2020. The  increases  were  primarily  due  to  subscription  revenue  growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal  2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\n- Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily  due  to  increases  in  base  and  incentive  compensation  and  related  benefits  costs,  as  well  as  increased marketing spend.",

      "question": "How did NVIDIA's increase in corporate infrastructure and support costs from 2022 to 2024 impact their ability to allocate expenses to core business segments, and what does this suggest about their centralized cost management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA reported corporate infrastructure and support costs as part of the 'All Other' category, which included enterprise-level expenses not assigned to either the Graphics or Compute & Networking segments. By 2024, these costs remained in the 'All Other' category, but the company's overall expense structure suggests a continued reliance on centralized cost management. The persistence of significant unallocated costs indicates that NVIDIA has not shifted toward decentralizing these expenses into operating segments, implying a strategic preference for maintaining enterprise-level cost control. This trend reflects a consistent financial strategy across years, where corporate-level expenses are managed separately from segment performance to preserve operational clarity in core business units.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NVDA(2022) \u2192 Corporate Infrastructure and Support Costs: In 2022, these costs were explicitly listed as part of the 'All Other' category and were not allocated to either the Graphics or Compute & Networking segments.",
        "Hop 2: Corporate Infrastructure and Support Costs \u2192 All Other: These costs are categorized under 'All Other' as enterprise-level expenses, including stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, and other non-recurring charges.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Cisco's services gross margin increased by 1.7 percentage points, driven by higher sales volume, lower headcount-related and delivery costs, and a favorable mix of service offerings. This improvement in services gross margin positively impacted the EMEA segment, where gross margin also increased due to favorable product mix, productivity benefits, and the uplift from services. By 2024, the EMEA segment's financial position reflected this trend, with its balance rising to $9,118 million from $9,062 million in 2023, showing a $56 million increase, partly attributed to sustained performance improvements from the prior year.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Cisco's service revenue declined by 2% in the Americas segment due to declines in maintenance, advisory services, and software support offerings. This negative performance in the Americas segment likely placed downward pressure on the services gross margin. However, in 2023, despite the prior year's challenges, Cisco reported a 1.7 percentage point increase in services gross margin, driven by higher sales volume, lower headcount-related and delivery costs, and favorable mix of service offerings. The improvement in services gross margin was also supported by productivity benefits and favorable product mix within the Americas segment. This suggests that while the 2022 decline in Americas service revenue may have initially constrained gross margin performance, strategic cost management and improved service mix helped reverse the trend in 2023.",

      "answer": "The drop in QTL's EBT from $4,628M in 2022 to $3,628M in 2023 indicates a weakening in the profitability of Qualcomm\u2019s licensing segment. This decline occurred despite QTL still being a significant contributor to overall EBT. In contrast, the QSI segment showed a notable turnaround with a $116M EBT increase in 2023, suggesting a shift in strategic investment outcomes. This contrast implies that while the traditional licensing business faced headwinds, Qualcomm\u2019s strategic initiatives may have started to yield better returns, potentially signaling a strategic pivot or diversification in focus.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, certain share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development expenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. Our CODM does not evaluate our operating segments using discrete asset information.",

      "question": "How did the change in AMD's licensing gain from $34 million in 2023 to $48 million in 2024 reflect the evolution of the company's IP licensing activities within the 'All Other' category?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMD's 'All Other' category included licensing gain as a key component among unallocated credits and expenses, indicating sporadic IP licensing activity. By 2024, the licensing gain increased to $48 million, up from $34 million in 2023, suggesting a more active or strategic approach to IP monetization. This upward trend implies that AMD may have intensified its efforts to license intellectual property, contributing to the broader financial dynamics within the 'All Other' category and reflecting a potential shift in how the company leverages its IP portfolio for financial benefit.",

      "answer": "Microsoft Cloud revenue increased from $111.6 billion in fiscal 2023 to $137.4 billion in fiscal 2024, reflecting strong growth in cloud adoption. This growth was primarily driven by Azure and other cloud services, which are core components of the Server Products and Cloud Services segment. As a result, the strategic positioning of Server Products and Cloud Services within the broader Intelligent Cloud segment became more prominent, as evidenced by its continued inclusion as a primary component of the Intelligent Cloud in the 2024 10-K filing. This indicates a deepening integration and emphasis on cloud infrastructure to power modern business and developer needs.",

      "answer": "In 2023, TXN's Other segment reported $1.11 billion in revenue and included acquisition, integration, and restructuring charges as part of its non-operational items. By 2024, Other segment revenue decreased to $947 million, and restructuring charges of $124 million were explicitly recorded under this segment. Despite the revenue decline, the segment's gross profit increased slightly to $584 million in 2024 from an implied $584 million in 2023 (based on $1.11B revenue and $527M gross profit margin), resulting in an improved gross margin of 61.7% in 2024 compared to an estimated 52.6% in 2023.

By 2023, this segment was explicitly cited as one of the three key industries driving 7% local currency revenue growth in Growth Markets, alongside Banking & Capital Markets and Industrial. This suggests that despite being a sub-segment within Resources in 2022, Chemicals & Natural Resources emerged as a strategically important growth lever by 2023, particularly in markets like Japan and Argentina.

      "answer": "In 2022, Intel faced excess inventory risks due to demand forecasting mismatches, which led to inventory write-downs and negatively impacted gross margins. This issue carried forward into 2024, where Intel incurred a $922 million inventory-related charge for its Gaudi AI accelerator, indicating continued struggles with demand forecasting and inventory management. Additionally, manufacturing yield challenges and delays in process node development further pressured gross margins in 2024. The evolution from 2022 to 2024 shows a transformation in the nature of inventory and margin risk\u2014from general forecasting mismatches to specific product line failures and process inefficiencies\u2014demonstrating a cascading negative impact from excess inventory to gross margin performance.",

          "chunk_text": "The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.\n\nAssets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use nonbinding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Debt Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nMarketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n78",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties.\n\nWe are continually engaged in the development of next-generation technologies. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially  anticipated.\n\nWe are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries, such as TSM C, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. On the product side, we have had limited market success with our accelerator offerings, and in 2024 we recognized $922 million in Gaudi A I accelerator inventory-related charges. We may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of further delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products or lack of market success with our offerings.\n\nOur efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&amp;D investments, particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses, as we were required to do in the third quarter of 2024 with respect to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A  new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. In addition, the cost of new leading-edge process nodes continues to increase at a higher rate relative to legacy process nodes due to a number of factors, including the cost of procuring and operating advanced manufacturing equipment. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have increased the number of transistors per die, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products.\n\nOur disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability  to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.\n\nFrom time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses; interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions-all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could result in production timing delays. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability  to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation\n\n33",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMD disclosed a $186 million purchase commitment for 2026, which increased to $274 million in the 2024 disclosure for the same year. This indicates that AMD's obligations under unconditional purchase commitments for 2026 grew by $88 million between the two reporting periods. Over the same time, AMD's total unconditional purchase commitments also increased from $4,594 million in 2023 to $4,968 million in 2024, suggesting a broader increase in long-term spending commitments.

      "answer": "In 2023, QCOM's QSI segment reported a loss of $12M in EBT, indicating underperformance or early-stage investments. By 2024, this flipped dramatically to a $104M EBT, showing a 116M swing. This positive impact on EBT was tied directly to QSI's strategic investments, which, according to 2024 disclosures, were being managed with a sharper focus on high-impact opportunities. This evolution suggests that QCOM recalibrated its strategic investment portfolio during this period, leading to a substantial financial turnaround in QSI and signaling a stronger alignment with growth-oriented initiatives.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

      "answer": "The QTL segment demonstrated significant strategic value to Qualcomm by driving licensing revenue growth from $5.3 billion in 2023 to $5.57 billion in 2024, an increase of $266 million, while requiring only a minimal increase in segment balance from $733 million to $734 million. This indicates that the QTL segment maintained a highly capital-efficient profile, generating substantial revenue growth with nearly flat balance sheet investment. Additionally, the segment's EBT margin expanded from 68% in 2023 to 72% in 2024, showing improved profitability alongside revenue growth. This combination of strong financial performance and low capital intensity underscores the QTL segment\u2019s critical role in Qualcomm\u2019s overall business strategy, particularly through its licensing of 3G, 4G, and 5G standard-essential patents, which underpin a broad range of wireless technologies and devices.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ADBE reported Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO) of $13.99 billion, indicating a large volume of contracted revenue yet to be recognized, with approximately 72% expected to be fulfilled within 12 months. By 2023, the company disclosed a Backlog value of only $40 million, which is a significantly smaller figure and likely represents a different category of unfulfilled obligations. Given that Backlog and RPO are conceptually related\u2014both representing future revenue commitments\u2014the drastic reduction suggests either a substantial acceleration in fulfilling contractual obligations or a reclassification of how future revenue commitments are tracked and reported. This shift may signal improved execution speed on customer contracts, but it could also reduce revenue visibility for investors who typically rely on large RPO figures to assess future performance predictability.",

Deferred revenue does not represent the total contract value of annual or multi-year non-cancellable subscription agreements.\n\nPayment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60  days.  In  instances  where  the  timing  of  revenue  recognition  differs  from  the  timing  of  invoicing,  we  have  determined  our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, such as invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and not to receive financing from our customers. Any potential financing fees are considered insignificant in the context of our contracts.\n\nAs  of  December  3,  2021,  the  balance  of  deferred  revenue  was  $4.88  billion,  which  includes  $88  million  of  refundable customer deposits. Refundable customer deposits represent arrangements in which the customer has a unilateral cancellation right for  which  we  are  obligated  to  refund  amounts  paid  related  to  products  or  services  not  yet  delivered  or  provided  at  the  time  of cancellation on a prorated basis. Arrangements with some of our enterprise customers with non-cancellable and non-refundable committed funds provide options to either renew monthly on-premise term-based licenses or use some or all funds to purchase other Adobe products  or  services.  Non-cancellable  and  non-refundable  committed  funds  related  to  these  agreements  comprised approximately 5% of the total deferred revenue.\n\nAs of November 27, 2020, the balance of deferred revenue was $3.76 billion. Significant movements in the deferred revenue balance during the period consisted of increases due to payments received prior to transfer of control of the underlying performance obligations  to  the  customer  and  deferred  revenue  assumed  through  acquisition,  which  were  offset  by  decreases  due  to  revenue recognized in the period. During the year ended December 3, 2021, approximately $3.55 billion of revenue was recognized that was included in the balance of deferred revenue as of November 27, 2020.\n\nTransaction  price  allocated  to  remaining  performance  obligations  represents  contracted  revenue  that  has  not  yet  been recognized, which includes deferred revenue and unbilled amounts that will be recognized as revenue in future periods. Transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is influenced by several factors, including the timing of renewals and average contract term. We applied practical expedients to exclude amounts related to performance obligations that are billed and recognized as they are delivered, optional purchases that do not represent material rights, sales- and usage-based royalties not yet consumed and any estimated amounts of variable consideration that are subject to constraint.\n\nRemaining performance obligations were approximately $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021. Non-cancellable and nonrefundable committed funds related to some of our enterprise customer agreements referred to in the paragraph above comprised approximately 5% of the total remaining performance obligations. Approximately 72% of the remaining performance obligations, excluding the aforementioned enterprise customer agreements, are expected to be recognized over the next 12 months with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\n## Contract Acquisition Costs\n\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized.\n\nThe costs capitalized are primarily sales commissions paid to our sales force personnel. Capitalized costs may also include portions of fringe benefits and payroll taxes associated with compensation for incremental costs to acquire customer contracts and incentive payments to partners.\n\nCapitalized costs to obtain a contract are amortized over the expected period of benefit, which we have determined, based on analysis,  to  be  5  years.  Amortization  of  capitalized  costs  are  included  in  sales  and  marketing  expense  in  our  Consolidated Statements  of  Income.  During  fiscal  2021  and  2020,  we  amortized  $212  million  and  $186  million  of  capitalized  contract acquisition costs into sales and marketing expense, respectively. We did not incur any impairment losses in fiscal 2021 and 2020.\n\nCapitalized contract acquisition costs were $611 million and $530 million as of December 3, 2021 and November 27, 2020, of which $406 million and $352 million was long-term and included in other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets,",

      "answer": "The significant increase in QCOM's EBT from $12 billion in 2023 to $104 billion in 2024 was largely driven by improvements in the QTL segment, which saw its EBT contribution rise from $3,628 million in 2023 to $4,027 million in 2024. This growth in QTL's EBT, despite broader declines in other segments like QCT, suggests that the licensing business became more strategically important to QCOM's profitability.

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

      "answer": "In 2023, Broadcom disclosed an expected term of 4.8 years for stock awards, indicating a longer vesting period aligned with multi-year retention goals. By 2024, this expected term was reduced to 3.6 years, suggesting a shift toward shorter-term incentive structures. The 2024 filing clarifies that these vesting periods were now directly aligned with the contractual terms of the awards, implying a more structured and potentially performance-linked approach to equity compensation. This change could indicate a strategic pivot to balance long-term retention with more immediate performance incentives.",

We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020 which represents 24% yearover-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021 from $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Workfront's workflow platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.\n\n## COVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess,  conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As  a  result,  we  have  reopened  our  offices  in  areas  with  sustained  low  infection  rates  and  are  allowing  fully  vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.\n\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021\n\nOur financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion  in  fiscal  2020. The  increases  were  primarily  due  to  subscription  revenue  growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal  2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\n- Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily  due  to  increases  in  base  and  incentive  compensation  and  related  benefits  costs,  as  well  as  increased marketing spend.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's unearned revenue tied to software support, cloud services, and other deferred items grew significantly from $218 million in fiscal 2023 to $573 million in fiscal 2024. This increase in deferred revenue, which directly affects taxable income timing, coincided with a rise in long-term income tax payable from $1,204 million in fiscal 2023 to $1,361 million in fiscal 2024. The connection between these two liabilities reflects the tax implications of recognizing revenue over time, as deferred revenue creates temporary differences for tax purposes.

      "answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA partnered with Google Cloud, which itself saw a $2.5 billion decrease in its operating loss from 2020 to 2021 due to revenue growth and cost optimization. By 2023, NVIDIA reported a year-on-year decrease in its All Other operating loss, which included a one-time $1.4 billion cost from the Arm acquisition termination. Despite this significant expense, NVIDIA's overall operating loss improved, suggesting that external partnerships like the one with Google Cloud may have helped offset some internal costs. This indicates a strategic alignment where NVIDIA's collaboration with a cloud provider showing improving financials could have contributed to NVIDIA's own financial resilience during a period of major strategic change.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, ADBE's Creative ARR was $12.37 billion, which increased to $12.54 billion in fiscal 2024. This $170 million growth in Creative ARR contributed to the overall increase in Digital Media ARR, which rose from $15.17 billion in fiscal 2023 to $15.35 billion in fiscal 2024. The relatively modest growth in Creative ARR compared to the total Digital Media ARR suggests that the Creative Cloud segment, while still growing, contributed less momentum to the overall Digital Media business compared to other components like Document Cloud. This indicates a potential slowdown or stabilization in Creative Cloud's growth trajectory relative to the broader Digital Media ecosystem.",

By fiscal 2024, subcontractor costs were still a component of cost of services, but the increase in cost of services slowed to just $354 million (1%), and gross margin improved to 32.6%, attributed to lower labor costs.

      "answer": "In 2022, Microsoft's increased investments in cloud infrastructure, including datacenters and AI capabilities, led to higher operating costs that negatively impacted gross margins. This pressure was compounded by the need to scale Azure and maintain competitive positioning amid rising industry-wide demand. By 2023, these infrastructure scaling efforts, particularly in datacenter expansion and hardware production for servers and AI platforms, led to inventory challenges, including excess or obsolete inventory risks due to supply chain constraints and fluctuating component availability. The shift from margin pressure in 2022 to inventory risk in 2023 reflects a temporal cascade where earlier infrastructure commitments created downstream operational complexities.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART I Item 1A\n\n## Business model competition\n\nCompanies compete with us based on a growing variety of business models.\n\n- Even as we transition more of our business to infrastructure-, platform-, and software-as-a-service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates a substantial portion of our software revenue. We bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many of our competitors also develop and sell software to businesses and consumers under this model.\n- Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money by selling thirdparty advertising. Advertising revenue funds development of products and services these competitors provide to users at no or little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products.\n- Some companies compete with us by modifying and then distributing open source software at little or no cost to end users, and earning revenue on advertising or integrated products and services. These firms do not bear the full costs of  research  and  development  for  the  open  source  software.  Some  open  source  software  mimics  the  features  and functionality of our products.\n\nThe competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and/or increased operating costs, such as for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead to lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income.\n\nOur increasing focus on cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. A growing part of our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum of computing devices. Our strategic vision is to compete and grow by building  best-in-class  platforms  and  productivity  services  for  an  intelligent  cloud  and  an  intelligent  edge  infused  with  artificial intelligence ('AI'). At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services in  the  cloud  and  sometimes  the  user's  choice  of  which  cloud-based  services  to  use.  We  are  devoting  significant  resources  to develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue to evolve with this changing environment. We embrace cultural and organizational changes to drive accountability and eliminate obstacles to innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview is connected with the growth of the Internet of Things ('IoT'). Our success in the IoT will depend on the  level  of  adoption  of  our  offerings  such  as Azure, Azure  Stack, Azure  IoT  Edge,  and Azure  Sphere.  We  may  not  establish market share sufficient to achieve scale necessary to meet our business objectives.\n\nBesides  software  development  costs,  we  are  incurring  costs  to  build  and  maintain  infrastructure  to  support  cloud  computing services.  These  costs  will  reduce  the  operating  margins  we  have  previously  achieved.  Whether  we  succeed  in  cloud-based services depends on our execution in several areas, including:\n\n- Continuing to bring to market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share.\n- Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance of our cloud-based services on the growing array of computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, as well as sensors and other IoT endpoints.\n- Continuing to enhance the attractiveness of our cloud platforms to third-party developers.\n- Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations of our customers and maintain the security of their data as well as help them meet their own compliance needs.\n- Making our suite of cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available on a wide range of devices and ecosystems, including those of our competitors.\n\nIt is uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users or generate the revenue required to succeed. If we are not effective in executing organizational and technical changes to increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, or if we fail to generate sufficient usage of our new products and services, we may not grow revenue in line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income.",

          "chunk_text": "We  often  partner  with  third-party  providers  for  certain  worker  services  and  we  may  provide  certain  limited  worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

      "answer": "In 2023, QCOM faced significant uncertainty in its licensing revenue due to ongoing global discussions and litigation around patent laws, particularly concerning standard-essential patents, which posed a risk to the long-term stability of this revenue stream. However, in 2024, the QTL segment reported a $266 million increase in licensing revenues, indicating that despite these challenges, QCOM was able to maintain and even grow its licensing income. This growth suggests that QCOM's licensing model, which is a core component of the QTL segment, remained resilient and effective in the face of external legal and regulatory pressures.",

      "answer": "The QTL segment's licensing revenue remained relatively flat, increasing slightly from $731 million in 2022 to $734 million in 2023. This marginal growth of $3 million (0.4%) suggests that despite QCOM's expressed concerns in 2022 about risks from customer vertical integration and U.S.-China trade tensions impacting licensing revenues, the company managed to maintain near-stable licensing income year-over-year. However, the minimal increase indicates that the licensing business faced headwinds strong enough to limit growth, even as QCOM emphasized that substantially all QTL revenues come from royalties on mobile handset sales through licensing agreements with OEMs.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices. If revenues derived from these customers or licensees decrease or the timing of such revenues fluctuates, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected .'\n\n## A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions.\n\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs, and from non-Chinese OEMs that utilize our integrated circuit products in their devices and sell those devices into China, which has the largest number of smartphone users in the world. We also source certain critical integrated circuit products from suppliers in China.\n\nDue to various factors, including pressure, encouragement or incentives from, or policies of, the Chinese government (including its Made in China 2025 campaign), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons, some of our Chinese integrated circuit customers have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices, or use our competitors' integrated circuit products in their devices, rather than our products, which could materially harm our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position.

      "answer": "In 2022, ACN's Growth Markets Segment contributed $476 million to operating income growth, but this was partially offset by lower contract profitability, indicating early signs of pressure from complex deals. By 2024, the company explicitly highlighted increased exposure to large, complex client engagements\u2014such as business transformation and cloud migration projects\u2014as a major profitability risk, citing challenges in forecasting effort and cost, reliance on subcontractors, and the inherent complexity of integrating new technologies. These 2024 disclosures suggest that the profitability pressures first mentioned in 2022 had evolved into more systemic risks tied to the strategic shift toward larger, more complex contracts. This progression reflects a growing dependence on deals with higher execution risk and greater sensitivity to third-party performance and client-specific variables.",

The commentary below provides insight into other factors affecting geographic market performance and operating income for fiscal 2022 compared with fiscal 2021:\n\n- North America operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.\n- Europe operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability and higher acquisition-related costs.\n- Growth Markets operating income increased primarily due to revenue growth, partially offset by lower contract profitability.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), net\n\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of foreign currency gains and losses, non-operating components of pension expense, as well as gains and losses associated with our investments. During fiscal 2022, Other income (expense) decreased $238 million from fiscal 2021, primarily due to lower gains on investments. For additional information on investments, see Note 1 (Summary of Significant Accounting Policies) to our Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Loss on Disposition of Russia Business\n\nWe recorded a loss from the disposal of our business in Russia of $96 million during fiscal 2022.\n\n## Income Tax Expense\n\nThe effective tax rate for fiscal 2022 was 24.0%, compared with 22.8% for fiscal 2021. Absent the $271 million investment gains and related $41 million in tax expense, our effective tax rate for fiscal 2021 would have been 23.1%.

          "chunk_text": "Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs and optimize our business. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to cost-effectively hire and retain people with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability.\n\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable. Our contract profitability  is highly  dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client's satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nMoreover, many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy  these measures, it could significantly  reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms, any of which could significantly affect our profitability. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients' actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nWe are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business. The scale and complexity of these projects present risks in execution and profitability challenges as a result of the costs we incur and investments we make at the beginning of these transactions. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or provide anticipated productivity gains, or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. A ny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effectiv e tax  rate in the future could be adv ersely  affected by  challenges to our intercompany  transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

      "question": "How did the changes in ACN's workforce size and attrition rates between fiscal 2022 and 2023 affect the relationship between Sales and Marketing Costs and Compensation Costs, particularly given the 19% attrition rate in 2022 versus 13% in 2023 and the corresponding workforce increases from 624,000 to 733,000?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, ACN experienced a 19% voluntary attrition rate and a workforce of approximately 624,000 as of August 31, 2021, growing to 721,000 by August 31, 2022. This high attrition and rapid hiring contributed to increased Compensation Costs, which in turn influenced Sales and Marketing Costs, as these are heavily driven by business development compensation. By fiscal 2023, the voluntary attrition rate dropped to 13%, and the workforce grew to approximately 733,000 as of August 31, 2023. The lower attrition and more stable workforce likely reduced the pressure on Compensation Costs, which may have helped moderate the growth of Sales and Marketing Costs. ACN also noted in 2023 that they adjust pricing and delivery efficiencies to offset compensation increases, suggesting a strategic effort to manage the interplay between these cost categories. The relationship between these costs evolved as workforce dynamics stabilized, potentially improving cost predictability and efficiency in business development activities.",

We hire to meet current and projected future demand. We proactively plan and manage the size and composition of our workforce and take actions as needed to address changes in the anticipated demand for our services and solutions, given that compensation costs are the most significant portion of our operating expenses. Our workforce, the majority of which serves our clients, increased to approximately 721,000 as of August 31, 2022, compared to approximately 624,000 as of August 31, 2021. The year-over-year increase in our workforce reflects an overall increase in demand for our services and solutions, as well as people added in connection with acquisitions.\n\nDuring fiscal 2022, we experienced a competitive labor market with high demand for the skills our people have, which contributed to elevated levels of voluntary attrition. For fiscal 2022, attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 19%, up from 14% in fiscal 2021. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, annualized attrition, excluding involuntary terminations, was 20%, flat with 20% in the third quarter of fiscal 2022. We evaluate voluntary attrition, adjust levels of new hiring and use involuntary terminations as means to keep our supply of skills and resources in balance with changes in client demand.\n\nIn addition, we adjust compensation in order to attract and retain appropriate numbers of qualified employees. For the majority of our people, compensation increases become effective December 1st of each fiscal year. Given the overall inflationary environment, compensation has been and continues to increase faster than in prior years. In fiscal 2022, we have improved pricing, which we define as the contract profitability or margin on the work that we sell, across our business. While we are increasing pricing, as well as changing the mix of people and utilizing technology to reduce the impact of these compensation increases on our margin, the impact of these actions did not in fiscal 2022, and may not in the future, fully offset the impact of the compensation increases, resulting in lower contract profitability.\n\nOur ability to grow our revenues and maintain or increase our margin could be adversely affected if we are unable to: match people and skills with the types or amounts of services and solutions clients are demanding; recover or offset increases in compensation; deploy our employees globally on a timely basis; manage attrition; and/or effectively assimilate new employees.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs on outsourcing contracts. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by: compensation costs for business development activities; marketing- and advertising-related activities; and certain acquisitionrelated costs. General and administrative costs primarily include costs for people that are non-client-facing, information systems, office space and certain acquisitionrelated costs.\n\nGross margin (Revenues less Cost of services as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2022 was 32.0%, compared with 32.4% for fiscal 2021. The decrease in gross margin for fiscal 2022 was due to higher labor costs, including increased compensation and subcontractor costs, partially offset by a decrease in non-payroll costs.\n\nSales and marketing and General and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% for fiscal 2022, compared with 17.3% for fiscal 2021. For fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, Sales and marketing costs decreased 60 basis points primarily due to lower selling and advertising costs as a percentage of revenues. General and administrative costs increased 10 basis points as a percentage of revenues.\n\nOperating margin (Operating income as a percentage of Revenues) for fiscal 2022 was 15.2%, compared with 15.1% for fiscal 2021.",

      "answer": "Intel's 2022 interest coverage ratio, disclosed in their 10-K filing, reflects their ability to service debt based on pre-tax income and interest costs. This metric directly impacts how much outstanding debt the company can sustain without increasing financial risk. In 2023, Intel refinanced $11.0 billion in senior notes, indicating a strategic shift to manage liquidity and fund capital expenditures and operational needs. The refinancing suggests that despite potential constraints in 2022, Intel was able to restructure its debt profile in 2023 to support broader corporate objectives, likely informed by the interest coverage ratio's signal of financial capacity.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, QCT gross margin improved, which had a positive impact on the overall gross margin percentage. However, this was offset by a decline in the proportion of higher-margin QTL licensing revenues relative to QCT revenues, resulting in a flat gross margin percentage for that year. In fiscal 2023, the gross margin percentage remained flat again, suggesting that the positive influence from the prior year\u2019s QCT improvements did not translate into an increase in the overall gross margin percentage, potentially due to continued shifts in revenue mix or sustained pressure from QTL licensing dynamics. This indicates that while QCT performance improved, structural changes or challenges in the revenue base constrained overall margin expansion.",

This relationship persisted into 2024, where inventory obsolescence adjustments and underutilization of proprietary fabrication facilities continued to pressure margins. Specifically, AVGO noted in 2024 that if owned fabrication facilities were not utilized at desired levels, fixed costs would not be absorbed, leading to higher unit costs and lower gross margins.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, we have moved largely to a build to order model and have extended customer lead times substantially in light of supply chain challenges. More typically, however, to ensure the availability of our semiconductor products we start manufacturing based on customer forecasts, which are not binding. As a result, we incur inventory and manufacturing costs in advance of anticipated sales that may be substantially lower than expected. If actual demand for our products is lower than forecast, we may also experience higher inventory carrying and operating costs and product obsolescence. Because certain of our sales, research and development, and internal manufacturing overhead expenses are relatively fixed, a reduction in customer demand may also decrease our gross margin and operating income.\n\nConversely, customers often require rapid increases in production on short notice. If we are unable to meet such increases in demand, this could damage our customer relationships, reduce revenue growth and margins, subject us to additional liabilities, harm our reputation, and prevent us from taking advantage of opportunities.\n\n## Winning business in the semiconductor solutions industry is subject to a lengthy process that often requires us to incur significant expense, from which we may ultimately generate no revenue.\n\nOur semiconductor business is dependent on us winning competitive bid selection processes, known as 'design wins'. These selection processes are typically lengthy and can require us to dedicate significant development expenditures and scarce engineering resources in pursuit of a single customer opportunity. Failure to obtain a particular design win may prevent us from obtaining design wins in subsequent generations of a particular product. This can result in lost revenue and can weaken our position in future selection processes.\n\nWinning a product design does not guarantee sales to a customer. A delay or cancellation of a customer's plans could materially and adversely affect our financial results, as we incur significant expense in the design process and may generate little or no revenue from it. In addition, the timing of design wins is unpredictable and implementing production for a major design win, or multiple design wins at the same time, may strain our resources and those of our CMs. In such event, we may be forced to dedicate significant additional resources and incur additional costs and expenses. Further, often customers will only purchase limited numbers of evaluation units until they qualify the products and/or the manufacturing line for those products. The qualification process can take significant time and resources. Delays in qualification or failure to qualify our products may cause a customer to discontinue use of our products and result in a significant loss of revenue. Finally, customers could choose at any time to stop using our products or could fail to successfully market and sell their products, which could reduce demand for our products, and cause us to hold excess inventory, materially adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risks are exacerbated by the fact that many of our products, and the end products into which our products are incorporated, often have very short life cycles.\n\n## Competition in our industries could prevent us from growing our revenue.\n\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological changes, evolving industry standards, changes in customer requirements, often aggressive pricing practices and, in some cases, new delivery methods. We expect competition in these industries to continue to increase as existing competitors improve or expand their product offerings or as new competitors enter our markets.\n\nSome of our competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, a larger installed customer base, larger technical staffs, more established relationships with vendors or suppliers, or greater manufacturing, distribution, financial, research and development, technical and marketing resources than us. We also face competition from numerous smaller companies that specialize in specific aspects of the highly fragmented software industry, open source authors who provide software and IP for free, competitors who offer their products through try-and-buy or freemium models, and customers who develop competing products.\n\nIn addition, the trend toward consolidation is changing the competitive landscape. We expect this trend to continue, which may result in combined competitors having greater resources than us. Some of our competitors may also receive financial and other support from their home country government or may have a greater presence in key markets, a larger customer base, a more comprehensive IP portfolio or better patent protection than us.\n\nThe actions of our competitors, in the areas of pricing and product bundling in particular, could have a substantial adverse impact on us. Further, competitors may leverage their superior market position, as well as IP or other proprietary information, including interface, interoperability or technical information, in new and emerging technologies and platforms that may inhibit our ability to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete successfully, we may lose market share for our products or incur significant reduction in our gross margins, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.",

          "chunk_text": "We  often  partner  with  third-party  providers  for  certain  worker  services  and  we  may  provide  certain  limited  worker information to such third parties based on the scope of the services provided to us. However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

Our private cloud infrastructure suite of solutions are available directly from Broadcom, resellers and distributors, hyperscale cloud providers, value-added OEMs and VMware cloud service provider partners. VMware Cloud Foundation ('VCF') provides license portability, which enables customers to purchase subscriptions of VCF software and move their VCF environments between on-premises data centers and supported cloud endpoints. We remain focused on strengthening relationships and increasing penetration within our existing core, mainframe, VMware, and Symantec endpoint customers and expanding the adoption of our enterprise software offerings with these customers. We believe our enterprise-wide license model will continue to offer our customers reduced complexity, more flexibility and an easier renewal process that will help drive revenue growth.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nCost of products sold. Cost of products sold consists primarily of the costs for semiconductor wafers and other materials, as well as the costs of assembling and testing those products and materials. Such costs include personnel and overhead related to our manufacturing operations, which include stockbased compensation expense, related occupancy, computer services, equipment costs, manufacturing quality, order fulfillment, warranty adjustments, and i nventory adjustments including write-downs for inventory obsolescence.\n\nAlthough we outsource a significant portion of our manufacturing activities, we do have some proprietary semiconductor fabrication facilities. If we are unable to utilize our owned fabrication facilities at a desired level, the fixed costs associated with these facilities will not be fully absorbed, resulting in higher average unit costs and lower gross margins.\n\nCost of subscriptions and services. Cost of subscriptions and services consists of personnel, project costs associated with professional services or support of our subscriptions and services revenue, and allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses. Personnel costs include stock-based compensation expense.\n\nTotal cost of revenue also includes amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets and restructuring charges.\n\nResearch and development. Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel costs for our engineers engaged in the design and development of our products and technologies, including stock-based compensation expense. These expenses also include project material costs, third-party fees paid to consultants, prototype development expense, allocated facilities costs and other corporate expenses and computer services costs related to supporting computer tools used in the engineering and design process.\n\nSelling , general and administrative. Selling expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for sales and marketing personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, sales commissions paid to our independent sales representatives, advertising costs, trade shows, corporate marketing, promotion, travel related to our sales and marketing operations, related occupancy and equipment costs, and other marketing costs. General and administrative expense consists primarily of compensation and associated costs for executive management, finance, human resources and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation expense, outside professional fees, allocated facilities costs, acquisition-related costs, which include direct transaction costs and integration costs, and other corporate expenses.\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. In connection with our acquisitions, we recognize intangible assets that are amortized over their estimated useful lives. We also recognize goodwill, which is not amortized, and in-process research and development ('IPR&amp;D'), which is initially capitalized as an indefinite-lived intangible asset, in connection with our acquisitions. Upon completion of each underlying project, IPR&amp;D assets are reclassified as amortizable purchased intangible assets and amortized over their estimated useful lives.\n\nRestructuring and other charges. Restructuring and other charges consist primarily of non-recurring charges related to compensation costs associated with employee exit programs, IP litigation, alignment of our global manufacturing operations, rationalization of product development program costs, facility and l ease abandonments, fixed asset impairment, IPR&amp;D impairment, and other exit costs, including curtailment of service or supply agreements.\n\nInterest expense. Interest expense includes coupon interest, commitment fees, accretion of original issue discount, amortization of debt premiums and debt i s s uance costs, and expenses related to debt modifications or extinguishments.\n\nOther income (expense), net. Other income (expense), net includes interest income, gains and losses on investments, foreign currency remeasurement, and other miscellaneous items.\n\nProvision for income taxes. We benefit from the tax incentives extended to us in various jurisdictions to encourage investment or employment. Our tax i ncentives from the Singapore Economic Development Board provide that any qualifying income earned in Singapore is subject to tax incentives or reduced rates of Singapore income tax, subject to our compliance with the conditions specified in these incentives and legislative developments. These Singapore tax i ncentives are scheduled",

          "chunk_text": "Our profitability could suffer if our cost-management strategies are unsuccessful, and we may not be able to improve our profitability. Our ability to improve or maintain our profitability is dependent on our being able to successfully manage our costs, including taking actions to reduce certain costs and optimize our business. Our cost management strategies include maintaining appropriate alignment between the demand for our services and solutions and the workforce needed to deliver them. If we are not effective in managing our operating costs in response to changes in demand or pricing, or if we are unable to cost-effectively hire and retain people with the knowledge and skills necessary to deliver our services and solutions, particularly in areas of new technologies and offerings and in the right geographic locations, we may incur increased costs, which could reduce our ability to continue to invest in our business in an amount necessary to achieve our planned rates of growth and our desired levels of profitability.\n\nIf we do not accurately anticipate the cost, risk and complexity of performing our work or if third parties upon whom we rely do not meet their commitments, then our contracts could have delivery inefficiencies and be less profitable than expected or unprofitable. Our contract profitability  is highly  dependent on our forecasts regarding the effort and cost necessary to deliver our services and solutions, which are based on available data and could turn out to be materially inaccurate. If we do not accurately estimate the effort, costs or timing for meeting our contractual commitments and/or completing engagements to a client's satisfaction, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nMoreover, many of our contracts include clauses that tie our ultimate compensation to the achievement of agreed-upon performance standards or milestones. If we fail to satisfy  these measures, it could significantly  reduce or eliminate our fees under the contracts, increase the cost to us of meeting performance standards or milestones, delay expected payments or subject us to potential damage claims under the contract terms, any of which could significantly affect our profitability. We also have a number of contracts in which a portion of our compensation depends on performance measures such as cost-savings, revenue enhancement, benefits produced, business goals attained and adherence to schedule. These goals can be complex and may depend on our clients' actual levels of business activity or may be based on assumptions that are later determined not to be achievable or accurate and could negatively impact our profit margins if not achieved. Similarly, if we experience unanticipated delivery difficulties due to our management, the failure of third parties or our clients to meet their commitments, or for any other reason, our contracts could yield lower profit margins than planned or be unprofitable.\n\nWe are increasingly entering into contracts for large, complex client engagements to transform our clients' businesses. These deals may involve transforming a client's business, transitioning it to the cloud and updating their technology, while operating portions of their business. The scale and complexity of these projects present risks in execution and profitability challenges as a result of the costs we incur and investments we make at the beginning of these transactions. In particular, large and complex arrangements often require that we utilize subcontractors or that our services and solutions incorporate or coordinate with the software, systems or infrastructure requirements of other vendors and service providers, including companies with which we have alliances. Our profitability depends on the ability of these subcontractors, vendors and service providers to deliver their products and services in a timely manner, at the anticipated cost, and in accordance with the project requirements, as well as on our effective oversight of their performance. In some cases, these subcontractors are small firms, and they might not have the resources or experience to successfully integrate their services or products with large-scale engagements or enterprises. Some of this work involves new technologies, which may not work as intended or provide anticipated productivity gains, or may take more effort to implement than initially predicted. In addition, certain client work requires the use of unique and complex structures and alliances, some of which require us to assume responsibility for the performance of third parties whom we do not control. A ny of these factors could adversely affect our ability to perform and subject us to additional liabilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our relationships with clients and on our results of operations.\n\n## Changes in our level of taxes, as well as audits, investigations and tax proceedings, or changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, could have a material adverse effect on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to taxes in numerous jurisdictions. We calculate and provide for taxes in each tax jurisdiction in which we operate. Tax accounting often involves complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. We are subject to ongoing audits, investigations and tax proceedings in various jurisdictions. Tax authorities have disagreed, and may in the future disagree, with our judgments, and are taking increasingly aggressive positions opposing the judgments we make, including with respect to our intercompany transactions. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of our audits, investigations and tax proceedings to determine the appropriateness of our tax liabilities. However, our judgments might not be sustained as a result of these audits, investigations and tax proceedings, and the amounts ultimately paid could be materially different from the amounts previously recorded.\n\nIn addition, our effectiv e tax  rate in the future could be adv ersely  affected by  challenges to our intercompany  transactions, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in tax laws or in their interpretation or enforcement, changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates and changes in accounting principles, including the U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

      "answer": "In 2023, AMD reported $2.8 billion in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles as part of the All Other category, which also included $1.4 billion of stock-based compensation and $258 million in acquisition-related and other costs. This category was explicitly defined as non-reportable and excluded from the CODM's performance evaluation of the four main business segments (Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded). In 2024, the All Other category continued to serve as a non-allocable cost center, but now included additional restructuring charges alongside the same core components\u2014amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, stock-based compensation, and acquisition-related costs. The persistence of amortization within this category suggests that AMD maintained its strategy of isolating acquisition-related expenses from operational segment performance. However, the inclusion of restructuring charges in 2024 indicates a broader consolidation of non-operational costs, potentially signaling a shift in how the company manages and reports legacy acquisition impacts alongside new strategic adjustments.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Cisco (CSCO) reported $0 for indefinite-lived IPR&D as part of its acquisition disclosures. By fiscal 2024, while the indefinite-lived IPR&D line still showed $0, the overall acquisition-related financial disclosures show a significant increase in acquired intangible assets, particularly with the Splunk acquisition contributing $10,550 million in total intangible assets, including $3,900 million in finite-lived technology and $6,140 million in finite-lived customer relationships. This suggests that while CSCO did not report indefinite-lived IPR&D in either year, the nature and scale of acquisitions shifted dramatically in 2024, reflecting a strategic pivot toward large-scale platform acquisitions like Splunk, which were primarily valued for their established technology and customer base rather than early-stage R&D.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NVIDIA reported $1,353 million in acquisition termination costs as part of the 'All Other' category, which also included $2,710 million in stock-based compensation and $595 million in unallocated operating expenses. By 2024, the acquisition termination cost line item had been completely removed, with stock-based compensation increasing to $3,549 million and unallocated costs rising to $728 million. This shift indicates a strategic pivot away from pursuing major acquisitions (as evidenced by the disappearance of termination costs) while increasing investment in employee incentives and internal operations. The 'All Other' category total decreased from $5,411 million in 2023 to $4,890 million in 2024, showing that the removal of one-time acquisition costs helped offset increases in recurring expenses.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

Over the same period, unallocated corporate expenses impacting EBT increased from $2,188 million in 2022 to $3,322 million in 2024. This widening gap suggests that while QCT's standalone performance weakened, the growing burden of unallocated costs further pressured QCOM's total EBT, which fell from $14,998 million in 2022 to $10,336 million in 2024.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, certain share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development expenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters.

By 2023, AVGO financed the VMware acquisition by issuing $30.4 billion in term loans and assuming $8.25 billion in VMware debt, bringing total outstanding debt to $69.8 billion. This significant increase in debt would have placed pressure on AVGO to maintain sufficient earnings relative to interest expenses, as required by the interest coverage ratio covenant from the prior year.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## The instruments governing our indebtedness impose certain restrictions on our business.\n\nThe instruments governing our indebtedness contain certain covenants imposing restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business, to plan for, or react to, changes in the market conditions or our capital needs and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise. The restrictions placed on us include maintenance of an interest coverage ratio and limitations on our ability to incur certain secured debt, enter into certain sale and lease-back transactions and consolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the instruments contain customary events of default upon the occurrence of which, after any applicable grace period, the indebtedness could be declared immediately due and payable. In such event, we may not have sufficient available cash to repay such debt at the time it becomes due, or be able to refinance such debt on acceptable terms or at all. Any of the foregoing could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Servicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our substantial debt.\n\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, and to refinance our debt, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to satisfy our obligations under our current indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur and to make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our outstanding indebtedness or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms when needed, which could result in a default on our indebtedness.\n\n## Risks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\n\nAt times, our stock price has been volatile and it may fluctuate substantially in the future, which could result in substantial losses for our investors as well as class action litigation against us and our management which could cause us to incur substantial costs and divert our management's attention and resources.\n\nThe trading price of our common stock has, at times, fluctuated significantly and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to any of the risk factors listed in this 'Risk Factors' section, and others, including:\n\n- issuance of new or updated research or other reports by securities analysts;\n- fluctuations in the valuation and results of operations of our significant customers as well as companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n- announcements of proposed acquisitions by us or our competitors;\n- announcements of, or expectations of, additional debt or equity financing transactions;\n- stock price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock;\n- hedging or arbitrage trading activity involving our common stock; and\n- unsubstantiated news reports or other inaccurate publicity regarding us or our business.\n\nThese fluctuations are often unrelated or disproportionate to our operating performance. Broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or currency fluctuations, may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. You may not realize any return on your investment in us and may lose some or all of your investment. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. In addition, we have been, and in the future we may be, subject to lawsuits stemming from our acquisitions, including the VMware Merger. Securities litigation against us, including the lawsuits related to such acquisitions, could result in substantial costs and divert our management's attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\n\n## The amount and frequency of our stock repurchases may fluctuate.\n\nThe amount, timing and execution of our stock repurchase program may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes. These purposes include operational spending, capital spending, acquisitions, repayment of debt and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Changes in cash flows, tax laws and our stock price could also impact our stock repurchase program. We are not obligated to repurchase any specific amount of shares of common stock, and the stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, QCOM reported $1.2 billion in uncollected and disputed royalties due to licensee non-compliance and legal challenges, which directly threatened the stability of its licensing revenue model. The QTL segment, which in 2024 generated 100% of its revenues from licensing fees tied to mobile handset royalties, relies heavily on consistent royalty collections to maintain profitability. Despite ongoing challenges, the QTL segment reported a 68% gross margin in 2024, suggesting that QCOM either improved collection rates, renegotiated licensing terms, or offset losses through other revenue streams or cost controls. This indicates a strategic adaptation in managing royalty disputes while maintaining segment-level financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "In addition, certain licensees have disputed, underreported, underpaid, not reported or not paid royalties owed to us under their license agreements or reported to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations, and certain companies have yet to enter into or have delayed entering into or renewing license agreements with us for their use of our intellectual property, and they or others may engage in such behavior in the future. The fact that one or more licensees dispute, underreport, underpay, do not report or do not pay royalties owed to us may encourage other licensees to take similar actions or not renew their existing license agreements, and may encourage other licensees or unlicensed companies to delay entering into, or to not enter into, new license agreements. Further, to the extent such licensees and companies increase their device share, the negative impact of their underreporting, underpayment, non-payment or non-reporting on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition will be exacerbated.\n\nWe have been in the past and are currently subject to various litigation and/or governmental investigations and proceedings. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We may become subject to other litigation or governmental investigations or proceedings in the future. Additionally, certain of our direct and indirect customers and licensees have pursued, and others may in the future pursue, litigation or arbitration against us related to our business. Unfavorable resolutions of one or more of these matters have had and could in the future have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. See also the Risk Factors below titled 'Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations' and 'Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings.'\n\nIn addition, in connection with our participation in SDOs, we, like other patent owners, generally have made contractual commitments to such organizations to license those of our patents that would necessarily be infringed by standard-compliant products as set forth in those commitments (referred to as standard-essential patents). Some manufacturers and users of standardcompliant products advance interpretations of these commitments that are adverse to our licensing business, including interpretations that would limit the amount of royalties that we could collect on the licensing of our standard-essential patent portfolio.\n\nFurther, some third parties have proposed significant changes to existing intellectual property policies for implementation by SDOs and other industry organizations with the goal of significantly devaluing standard-essential patents. For example, some have put forth proposals which would require a maximum aggregate intellectual property royalty rate for the use of all standard-essential patents owned by all of the member companies to be applied to the selling price of any product implementing the relevant standard. They have further proposed that such maximum aggregate royalty rate be apportioned to each member company with standardessential patents based upon the number of standard-essential patents held by such company. Others have proposed that injunctions should not be an available remedy for infringement of standard-essential patents and have made proposals that could severely limit damage awards and other remedies by courts for patent infringement (e.g., by limiting the base upon which the royalty rate may be applied). A number of these strategies are purportedly based on interpretations of the policies of certain SDOs concerning the licensing of patents that are or may be essential to industry standards and on our (or other companies') alleged failure to abide by these policies.\n\nSome SDOs, courts and governmental agencies have adopted, and may in the future adopt, some or all of these interpretations or proposals in a manner adverse to our interests, including in litigation to which we may not be a party. Further, SDOs in certain countries may attempt to modify widely accepted standards and claim the resulting standard as their own.\n\nWe expect that such proposals, interpretations and strategies will continue in the future, and if successful, our business model would be harmed, either by limiting or eliminating our ability to collect royalties (or by reducing the royalties we can collect) on all or a portion of our standard-essential patent portfolio, limiting our return on investment with respect to new technologies, limiting our ability to seek injunctions against infringers of our standard-essential patents, constraining our ability to make licensing commitments when submitting our technologies for inclusion in future standards (which could make our technologies less likely to be included in such standards) or forcing us to work outside of SDOs or other industry groups to promote our new technologies, and our revenues, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, the legal and other costs associated with asserting or defending our positions have been and may in the future be significant. We expect that such challenges, regardless of their merits, will continue into the foreseeable future and will require the investment of substantial management time and financial resources.\n\n## Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\n\nAs described in the Risk Factor below titled ' Our business may suffer as a result of adverse rulings in governmental investigations or proceedings or other legal proceedings, ' we have been in the past, currently are and may in the future be subject to various governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings challenging our patent licensing practices. Certain of these matters are described in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' We believe that one intent of certain of these governmental investigations and legal proceedings has been to reduce the amount of royalties that licensees are required to pay to us for their use of our intellectual property.\n\nIf we were required to reduce the royalty rates in our patent license agreements, our revenues, earnings and cash flows would be negatively impacted absent a sufficient increase in the volume of sales of devices upon which royalties are paid.",

By 2024, the Embedded Processing segment directly contributed $352 million to the company's total operating profit of $5.465 billion, representing approximately 6.4% of the total. This indicates a shift in the segment\u2019s relative contribution to overall profitability, even as the company experienced a decline in total operating profit from $7.33 billion to $5.465 billion year-over-year.",

Revaluing our ending ARR for fiscal 2021 using currency  rates  at  the  beginning  of  fiscal  2022,  our  Digital  Media  ARR  at  the  end  of  fiscal  2021  would  be  $12.15  billion  or approximately $86 million lower than the ARR reported above.\n\nOur success in driving growth in ARR has positively affected our revenue growth. Creative revenue in fiscal 2021 was $9.55 billion, up from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020 and representing 23% year-over-year growth. Document Cloud revenue in fiscal 2021 was $1.97 billion, up from $1.50 billion in fiscal 2020 and representing 32% year-over-year growth which reflected an increase in demand driven by new user acquisition for our Document Cloud subscription offerings. Total Digital Media segment revenue grew to $11.52 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $9.23 billion in fiscal 2020 and representing 25% year-over-year growth.

IP-related costs continued to be a component of this category and were also explicitly included in the cost of revenue for 2023, contributing to a gross margin of 56.9%.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, ACN reported prior service costs of $1,052 thousand for postretirement medical plans, indicating minimal changes in plan design or assumptions (ACN 10-K 2022). By fiscal 2023, this figure surged to $11,888 thousand (ACN 10-K 2023), suggesting a major plan amendment or revision in actuarial assumptions. This order-of-magnitude increase implies that ACN likely expanded postretirement medical benefits or adjusted assumptions about future healthcare costs, directly impacting its long-term liabilities. Such a shift would influence the company's pension obligations and require ongoing actuarial reassessment of these growing liabilities.",

      "answer": "In FY23, ACN reported that 31% of the Group's FY24 revenue came from the Health & Public Service segment, with a breakdown of 31% Health, 18% Insurance, and 69% Public Service. By FY24, the Health & Public Service segment remained a key growth area, with the Public Service sub-segment increasing to 69% of the segment\u2019s revenue, suggesting a stronger emphasis on government and public sector clients. This shift indicates a strategic refocusing toward public service delivery, supported by ACN's global delivery capability and innovation investments, including $1.2 billion in R&D in FY24. The increased allocation to Public Service came at the expense of relative weight in Health and Insurance, signaling a recalibration of priorities within the segment.",

      "answer": "The increase in NVIDIA's income tax payable from $980 million in 2022 may be linked to shifts in revenue recognition timing and deferred tax implications tied to unearned revenue. By 2024, unearned revenue included $233 million in customer advances, but this dropped to $81 million in the next year, suggesting a significant acceleration in revenue recognition during this period. Since income tax is generally recognized based on accounting income rather than cash flows, this acceleration could have led to higher taxable income and thus higher income tax payable. This evolving relationship between unearned revenue and tax obligations reflects a strategic or operational shift in how NVIDIA is managing its customer contracts and tax planning.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA reported a gross carrying amount of $3,418 million for acquisition-related intangible assets, which decreased to $2,642 million by fiscal year 2024. This decline indicates a reduction in the value of acquisitions on the books, either due to amortization or potential write-downs. The trend suggests that NVIDIA may have been actively amortizing these assets over time, as evidenced by the accumulated amortization increasing from $1,304 million in 2022 to $1,720 million in 2024. This evolution reflects a maturing of past acquisitions and potentially a more conservative approach to asset valuation.",

Many of our products and much of our intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on consumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and/or innovation cycles (such as the transition to the next generation of wireless technologies). This has resulted in fluctuations in QCT revenues in advance of and during device launches incorporating our products and in QTL revenues when licensees' sales occur. These trends may or may not continue in the future. Further, the trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings.\n\n## Fiscal 2022 Overview and Other Recent Events\n\nRevenues were $44.2 billion, an increase of 32% compared to revenues of $33.6 billion in fiscal 2021, with net income of $12.9 billion, an increase of 43% compared to net income of $9.0 billion in fiscal 2021. Highlights from fiscal 2022 and other recent events included:\n\n- QCT revenues increased by 39% in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in average selling prices and favorable mix toward higher-tier 5G products along with higher integrated circuit shipments in handsets, as well as higher IoT revenues.\n- On June 15, 2022, the General Court of the European Union issued a ruling annulling in its entirety the European Commission's (EC) 2018 decision, which previously imposed a fine of 997 million euros for which we had provided financial guarantees to satisfy the obligation in lieu of cash payment. As a result, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded a $1.1 billion benefit in other income and a $62 million reduction in interest expense resulting from the reversal of the accrued fine and the associated interest previously recorded. See 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.'\n- On October 4, 2021, we and SSW Partners entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Veoneer, Inc. (Veoneer). The transaction closed on April 1, 2022. We funded substantially all of the total cash consideration paid in the transaction, which was approximately $4.7 billion. The operating results of the Non-Arriver businesses are reported as discontinued operations on a one quarter lag. Additional information related to this acquisition is included in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9.

This growth indicates stronger royalty inflows, likely due to increased sales of mobile handsets by QCOM's licensees.

      "question": "How did the gross carrying amount of NVIDIA's acquisition-related intangible assets change from fiscal year 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the company's acquisition strategy or amortization practices over time?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, NVIDIA reported a gross carrying amount of $3,418 million for acquisition-related intangible assets, which decreased to $2,642 million in fiscal year 2023. This $776 million decline indicates either a significant amortization of previously acquired intangibles or a strategic shift in managing or divesting certain acquired assets. The reduction in gross carrying amount from 2022 to 2023 aligns with an increase in accumulated amortization (from $1,304 million to $1,720 million), suggesting that the company has accelerated the amortization of these assets or has not replaced disposed assets at the same rate, reflecting a potential maturation or consolidation phase in its acquisition strategy.",

      "answer": "NVDA's 2022 partnership with Google Cloud occurred during a period where Google Cloud itself was experiencing a reduction in its operating losses, decreasing from $5,607 million in 2020 to $3,099 million in 2021. This suggests that Google Cloud was in a phase of improving operational efficiency during the period NVDA initiated its strategic relationship. However, in 2023, NVDA's own operating loss situation was directly impacted by a one-time $1.4 billion cost from the termination of the Arm acquisition. Unlike Google Cloud\u2019s gradual improvement, NVDA's operating loss was shaped by strategic M&A decisions rather than operational performance trends, indicating a divergence in how each company's losses evolved despite their partnership.",

      "question": "How did AMD's $12M licensing gain in 2022 relate to the composition of the All Other category in 2023, and what does this reveal about the company's IP licensing activity and cost structure evolution?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD reported a $12M licensing gain as a standalone item in its financial statements, indicating a direct financial benefit from IP licensing activities. By 2023, this licensing gain was no longer reported separately but was instead incorporated into the 'All Other' category, which aggregates non-segment-specific expenses and credits such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, stock-based compensation, and acquisition-related costs. This shift suggests that the licensing gain was no longer a material standalone item and was instead treated as part of broader corporate-level financial activity. The integration of the licensing gain into the All Other category indicates a change in how AMD accounted for IP-related gains, rather than necessarily signaling a continuation or increase in IP licensing activity. This evolution reflects a more consolidated approach to reporting non-operational financial items, potentially simplifying segment performance evaluation.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Compute & Networking segment reported depreciation and amortization expense of $377 million, which increased to $457 million in 2024 \u2014 a $80 million rise. Despite this growth in segment-level amortization, NVIDIA explicitly states that Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expense is not allocated to the Compute & Networking segment for internal performance assessment or operating decisions, and instead is grouped under 'All Other'. This suggests that while the segment absorbed more depreciation and amortization over the period, the specific impact of acquisition-related intangibles \u2014 which often contribute to such expenses \u2014 was excluded from segment-level financial evaluation. The increase in segment amortization thus reflects organic or prior asset-related costs rather than newly acquired intangible assets.",

This evolution suggests that ACN may have taken steps to mitigate future liabilities, such as plan amendments, benefit reductions, or increased employee contributions.

By fiscal year 2023, the net carrying amount decreased to $190 million, based on a gross carrying amount of $449 million and accumulated amortization of $259 million.

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

      "answer": "In 2022, Qualcomm's QTL segment derived substantially all of its revenues from royalties generated through licensees' sales of mobile handsets, indicating a strong dependency on licensee performance (QCOM_10k_2022.pdf:page_73:chunk_5). By 2024, new risks emerged where litigation against Qualcomm or its partners could severely disrupt the supply chain and business operations of chipset customers, directly impacting licensees' sales and thereby reducing QTL\u2019s royalty revenues (QCOM_10k_2024.pdf:page_34:chunk_1). This evolution highlights a growing vulnerability in the QTL segment's revenue model, as legal exposure now poses a material threat to the segment\u2019s historically stable licensing income stream. The structural dependency identified in 2022 has thus become a potential liability in 2024 due to increased exposure to litigation risks.",

We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product release or shipment delays and/or damage to our customer relationships, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers' devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.\n\n## Our use of open source software may harm our business.\n\nCertain of our software and our suppliers' software may contain or may be derived from 'open source' software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products' source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such open source software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers, or to license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing programs depend, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\n\n## GENERAL RISK FACTORS\n\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments or reserves, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. During such downturns, our revenues have declined, and our results of operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted. We expect our business to continue to be subject to such cyclical downturns.\n\nA decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers' and licensees' ability to purchase or pay for our products and intellectual property and network operators' ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be",

      "answer": "TXN's operating profit declined from $7.33 billion in 2023 to $5.465 billion in 2024, a decrease of $1.865 billion or 25.4%. Despite this overall decline, the Other Segment contributed $505 million to the total operating profit in 2024, representing approximately 9.2% of the total. This is a notable shift compared to 2023, where the Other Segment was not explicitly broken out but was part of the broader operations that contributed to the $7.33 billion total. The Other Segment\u2019s relative contribution increased in the context of overall profit contraction, suggesting it performed more resiliently compared to other business areas like Analog and Embedded Processing, which saw sharper declines. This indicates a shift in the internal profit dynamics at TXN, with the Other Segment playing a more prominent role in supporting profitability during a downturn.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, AVGO disclosed that the expected term for stock awards was 4.8 years, which was commensurate with the awards' contractual terms. By fiscal 2024, this expected term had decreased to 3.6 years, indicating a significant shift in the company's assumptions about the average holding period of these awards. This decrease in expected term likely reflects changes in employee exercise behavior or strategic adjustments in award structures. Since the expected term is a key input in the valuation of stock-based compensation, this reduction would generally lead to a lower fair value of awards, as shorter expected terms reduce exposure to volatility and interest rate assumptions over time.",

        "Hop 1: AVGO(2023) \u2192 Expected Term: AVGO disclosed that the expected term for stock awards was 4.8 years in fiscal 2023, aligned with contractual terms.",

      "answer": "In 2023, QCOM's QTL segment balance stood at $733 million, and it slightly increased to $734 million in 2024, indicating a minimal growth in the licensing business. However, the QTL segment's revenue is largely dependent on royalties generated through licensees' sales of mobile handsets. In 2024, QCOM highlighted increased exposure to risks such as litigation involving intellectual property, which could disrupt supply chains and harm relationships with licensees. These risks could lead to a decline in licensees' sales, directly impacting the QTL segment's revenue. Therefore, despite the slight increase in the segment balance, the heightened risk environment in 2024 introduced potential downward pressure on the stability and growth of the QTL segment's licensing revenue.",

        "Hop 3: Licensees Sales \u2190 QCOM(2024): In 2024, QCOM identified risks such as litigation and supply chain disruptions that could reduce licensees' sales, thereby negatively impacting QTL's licensing revenue."

          "chunk_text": "In any potential dispute involving us and another company's patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product release or shipment delays and/or damage to our customer relationships, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers' devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.\n\n## Our use of open source software may harm our business.\n\nCertain of our software and our suppliers' software may contain or may be derived from 'open source' software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products' source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such open source software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers, or to license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing programs depend, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\n\n## GENERAL RISK FACTORS\n\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments or reserves, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. During such downturns, our revenues have declined, and our results of operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted. We expect our business to continue to be subject to such cyclical downturns.\n\nA decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers' and licensees' ability to purchase or pay for our products and intellectual property and network operators' ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be",

Revenue growth was driven by the United States.\n- EMEA revenues were flat in local currency, as growth in Public Service was offset by declines in Communications &amp; M edia and Banking &amp; Capital M arkets. Revenues were driven by an increase in Italy, offset by declines in France and the United Kingdom.\n- Growth Markets revenues increased 7% in local currency, led by growth in Banking &amp; Capital M arkets, Industrial and Chemicals &amp; Natural Resources. Revenue growth was driven by Japan and Argentina, partially offset by declines in A ustralia and Brazil. A rgentina revenues grew in local currency due primarily to hyperinflation.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nOperating expenses for fiscal 2024 decreased $1 million from fiscal 2023, and decreased as a percentage of revenues to 85.2% from 86.3% during this period.\n\nThe primary categories of operating expenses include Cost of services, Sales and marketing and General and administrative costs. Cost of services is primarily driven by the cost of people serving our clients, which consists mainly of compensation, subcontractor and other payroll costs, and non-payroll costs such as facilities, technology and travel. Cost of services includes a variety of activities such as: contract delivery; recruiting and training; software development; and integration of acquisitions. Sales and marketing costs are driven primarily by compensation costs for business development activities;",

By 2024, the 2025 purchase commitment had increased to $4,501 million, which accounted for about 90.6% of the total unconditional purchase commitments of $4,968 million.

This performance was driven by strong results in Japan and Argentina, despite declines in Australia and Brazil. However, during fiscal 2024, ACN implemented geographic realignments that significantly altered the composition of Growth Markets\u2014specifically, the Middle East and Africa were moved to EMEA in fiscal 2024 (with prior periods reclassified), and in fiscal 2025, Latin America will move to North America, transforming Growth Markets into an Asia Pacific-focused market. These realignments suggest that the 2023 Growth Markets revenue performance, while positive, was based on a broader geographic footprint that would soon be reduced, potentially affecting the sustainability of the Banking & Capital Markets segment's contribution to future Growth Markets growth.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NVIDIA's 'All Other' category included IP-related costs among other enterprise-level expenses, such as stock-based compensation and corporate infrastructure costs. By 2023, the 'All Other' category continued to include IP-related costs, indicating that these expenses remained unassigned to the Graphics or Compute & Networking segments. The fact that IP-related costs were consistently categorized under 'All Other' in both years suggests that NVIDIA treated these expenses as enterprise-wide, rather than segment-specific. This aligns with the company's broader financial strategy of maintaining a unified architecture across segments while centralizing certain strategic costs at the corporate level.",

        "Hop 1: NVDA(2022) \u2192 IP-Related Costs: NVIDIA disclosed that IP-related costs were part of the 'All Other' category in 2022.",

Our contribution  expense  for  fiscal  years  2022,  2021,  and  2020  was  $168  million,  $120  million,  and  $76  million, respectively.\n\n## Note 17 - Segment Information\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information  presented  on  an  operating  segment  basis  for  purposes  of  making  decisions  and  assessing  financial performance.\n\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related  infrastructure,  and  solutions  for  gaming  platforms;  Quadro/NVIDIA  RTX  GPUs  for  enterprise  workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds.\n\nOur  Compute  &amp;  Networking  segment  includes  Data  Center  platforms  and  systems  for  AI,  HPC,  and  accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; CMP; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software.\n\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.\n\nThe  'All  Other'  category  includes  the  expenses  that  our  CODM  does  not  assign  to  either  Graphics  or  Compute  &amp; Networking  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions  or  assessing  financial  performance.  The  expenses  include stock-based  compensation  expense,  corporate  infrastructure  and  support  costs,  acquisition-related  costs,  IP-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\n\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the 'All Other' category.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, AMD disclosed a 2027 unconditional purchase commitment of $51 million, which decreased to $46 million by 2024, reflecting a reduction in expected procurement obligations for that year. Over the same period, AMD's total unconditional purchase commitments increased from $4,594 million to $4,968 million, indicating a net increase in long-term procurement obligations despite the reduction in the 2027 line item. This suggests that AMD may have shifted procurement commitments toward nearer-term years or renegotiated long-term contracts, aligning with evolving supply chain strategies or demand forecasts.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ACN's operating profit was negatively impacted by regulatory and compliance risks, particularly in government contracting, which included potential penalties, audits, and contract terminations. By 2024, ACN restructured its geographic reporting, merging the Middle East and Africa into the Europe segment to form EMEA. This reorganization, combined with productivity initiatives and pricing strategies, contributed to a 12% increase in EMEA segment operating profit in 2024. Despite the earlier risks, ACN managed to improve its segment performance, suggesting that strategic adjustments helped mitigate prior-year challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "Changes in laws and regulations could also mandate significant and costly changes to the way we implement our services and solutions or could impose additional taxes on our services and solutions. For example, changes in laws and regulations to limit using off-shore resources in connection with our work or to penalize companies that use off-shore resources, which have been proposed from time to time in various jurisdictions, could adversely affect our results of operations. Such changes may result in contracts being terminated or work being transferred onshore, resulting in greater costs to us, and could have a negative impact on our ability to obtain future work from government clients. In addition, several jurisdictions where we operate have proposed legislation regulating artificial intelligence and non-personal data that may impose significant requirements on how we design, build and deploy artificial intelligence and handle non-personal data for ourselves and our clients.\n\n## Our work with government clients exposes us to additional risks inherent in the government contracting environment.\n\nOur clients include national, provincial, state and local governmental entities. Our government work carries various risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n- Government entities, particularly in the United States, often reserve the right to audit our contract costs and conduct inquiries and investigations of our business practices and compliance with government contract requirements. U.S. government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, routinely audit our contract costs, including allocated indirect costs, for compliance with the Cost Accounting Standards and the Federal Acquisition Regulation. These agencies also conduct reviews and investigations and make inquiries regarding our accounting, information technology and other systems in connection with our performance and business practices with respect to our government contracts. Negative findings from existing and future audits, investigations or inquiries, or failure to comply with applicable IT security or supply chain requirements, could affect our future sales and profitability by preventing us, by operation of law or in practice, from receiving new government contracts for some period of time. In addition, if the U.S. government concludes that certain costs are not reimbursable, have not been properly determined or are based on outdated estimates of our work, then we will not be allowed to bill for such costs, may have to refund money that has already been paid to us or could be required to retroactively and prospectively adjust previously agreed to billing or pricing rates for our work. Negative findings from existing and future audits of our business systems, including our accounting system, may result in the U.S. government preventing us from billing, at least temporarily, a percentage of our costs. As a result of prior negative findings in connection with audits, investigations and inquiries, we have from time to time experienced some of the adverse consequences described above and may in the future experience further adverse consequences, which could materially adversely affect our future results of operations.\n- If a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations, we may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties, including those under the civil U.S. False Claims Act, and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government. The inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities.\n- U.S. government contracting regulations impose strict compliance and heightened disclosure obligations. From time to time we have made disclosures. Disclosure is required if certain company personnel have knowledge of 'credible evidence' of a violation of federal criminal laws involving fraud, conflict of interest, bribery or improper gratuity, a violation of the civil U.S. False Claims Act or receipt of a significant overpayment from the government. Failure to make required disclosures could be a basis for suspension and/or debarment from federal government contracting in addition to breach of the specific contract and could also impact contracting beyond the U.S. federal level. Reported matters may also lead to audits or investigations and other civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, including those described above.\n- Government contracts are subject to heightened reputational and contractual risks compared to contracts with commercial clients. For example, government contracts and the proceedings surrounding them are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity. Negative publicity, including an allegation of improper or illegal activity, regardless of its accuracy, may adversely affect our reputation.\n- Terms and conditions of government contracts also tend to be more onerous and are often more difficult to negotiate. For example, these contracts often contain high or unlimited liability for breaches and feature less favorable payment terms and sometimes require us to take on liability for the performance of third parties.\n- Government entities typically fund projects through appropriated monies. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions or other debt constraints could result in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. Furthermore, if insufficient funding is appropriated to the government entity to cover termination costs, we may not be able to fully recover our investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, QCOM's gross margin percentage remained flat largely due to a decrease in the proportion of higher-margin QTL licensing revenues relative to QCT revenues. By 2024, although QTL licensing revenues increased overall, there was a $90M decrease in revenue per unit, which could have pressured margins. However, the gross margin percentage appears to have improved or remained stable due to lower cost of sales (driven by reduced amortization expense) and higher overall QTL revenues. This suggests that despite the per-unit pricing pressure in QTL, cost efficiencies and volume gains helped offset the negative impact on gross margin.",

      "answer": "The consistent inclusion of litigation expenses in the 'Other' segment across both years indicates that Texas Instruments treats legal costs as part of its broader corporate overhead rather than allocating them to specific business units. In 2023, the 'Other' segment still included litigation expenses alongside other corporate-level items like environmental costs and restructuring charges, just as it did in 2022. This consistent treatment suggests a deliberate cost allocation strategy where non-operational and strategic expenses are centralized, allowing the company to maintain clearer performance visibility for its core segments\u2014Analog and Embedded Processing. Additionally, the 'Other' segment generated $1.11 billion in revenue in 2023, which remained relatively stable compared to 2022, implying that the company maintains this segment not only for its minor revenue contributions but also for managing corporate-level financial items.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

This growth directly contributed to the overall expansion of Digital Media ARR, which rose from $13.26 billion in fiscal 2022 to $15.17 billion in fiscal 2023 \u2014 a total increase of $1.91 billion. Since Digital Media ARR includes both Creative ARR and Document Cloud ARR, the $530 million increase in Document Cloud ARR accounted a significant portion (approximately 28%) of the total Digital Media ARR growth.

We have made significant investments to broaden the scale and size of all of these routes to market, and our recent financial results reflect the success of these investments.\n\nDigital Experience revenue was $3.87 billion in fiscal 2021, up from $3.13 billion in fiscal 2020 which represents 24% yearover-year growth. Driving this increase was the increase in subscription revenue across our offerings which grew to $3.38 billion in fiscal 2021 from $2.66 billion in fiscal 2020, representing 27% year-over-year growth. Also contributing to the increase in Digital Experience subscription revenue was revenue associated with Workfront's workflow platform offerings. We expect that the addition of Workfront, and continued demand across our portfolio of Digital Experience solutions, will drive revenue growth in future years.\n\n## COVID-19 UPDATE\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly-evolving and unpredictable impacts on global societies, economies, financial markets and business practices. As conditions fluctuate around the world, with vaccine administration rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. Our focus remains on promoting employee health and safety, serving our customers and ensuring business continuity. We carefully assess, and reassess,  conditions on a case-by-case basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices and resume business travel. As  a  result,  we  have  reopened  our  offices  in  areas  with  sustained  low  infection  rates  and  are  allowing  fully  vaccinated employees to return on a voluntary basis. In addition, we are implementing our reimagined framework for the future of work at Adobe, which is rooted in a flexible and hybrid model enabled by a digital-first mindset.\n\nDuring the pandemic, digital has become the primary way for people to connect, work, learn and be entertained, and for businesses to engage with customers. This ongoing shift to a digital-first world has increased the importance and relevance of our solutions, which has contributed to our continued growth year over year. However, while our revenue and earnings are relatively predictable as a result of our subscription-based business model, the duration of the pandemic and the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business remain uncertain. See the section titled 'Risk Factors' in Part I, Item 1A of this report for further discussion of the possible impact of the pandemic on our business.\n\n## Financial Performance Summary for Fiscal 2021\n\nOur financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n- Total Digital Media ARR of approximately $12.24 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $1.98 billion, or 19%, from $10.26 billion as of November 27, 2020. The change in our Digital Media ARR was primarily due to new user adoption of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Creative revenue of $9.55 billion increased by $1.81 billion, or 23%, during fiscal 2021, from $7.74 billion in fiscal 2020. Document Cloud revenue of $1.97 billion increased by $477 million, or 32%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.50 billion  in  fiscal  2020. The  increases  were  primarily  due  to  subscription  revenue  growth associated with our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings.\n- Digital Experience revenue of $3.87 billion increased by $742 million, or 24%, during fiscal 2021, from $3.13 billion in fiscal  2020. The increase was primarily due to subscription revenue growth across our offerings, including from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Remaining performance obligations of $13.99 billion as of December 3, 2021 increased by $2.65 billion, or 23%, from $11.34 billion as of November 27, 2020, primarily due to new contracts and renewals for our Digital Media and Digital Experience offerings, as well as impacts from our Workfront acquisition.\n- Cost of revenue of $1.87 billion increased by $143 million, or 8%, during fiscal 2021, from $1.72 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily due to increases in hosting services and data center costs, partially offset by decreases in Advertising Cloud media costs.\n- Operating expenses of $8.12 billion increased by $1.21 billion, or 17%, during fiscal 2021, from $6.91 billion in fiscal 2020 primarily  due  to  increases  in  base  and  incentive  compensation  and  related  benefits  costs,  as  well  as  increased marketing spend.",

      "question": "How did the increase in QCOM's Licensing Revenues from $5,306 million in 2023 to $5,572 million in 2024 reflect the performance and strategic positioning of the QTL Segment, given its balance grew from $733 million to $734 million over the same period?",
      "answer": "The QTL Segment, which is primarily responsible for generating Licensing Revenues, saw its segment balance remain relatively stable, increasing only slightly from $733 million in 2023 to $734 million in 2024. Despite this minimal change in segment balance, Licensing Revenues increased by $266 million, rising from $5,306 million in 2023 to $5,572 million in 2024. This indicates that the QTL Segment became more efficient in generating revenue relative to its asset base, suggesting either improved licensing terms, higher royalty yields, or better monetization of intellectual property during this period.",

      "question": "How did the regulatory pressures affecting QCOM's Licensing Revenues in 2023 influence the performance and strategic positioning of the QTL segment in 2024, particularly in light of the segment's reliance on licensing royalties from mobile handsets?",
      "answer": "In 2023, QCOM faced significant regulatory and legal pressures that threatened to reduce Licensing Revenues due to challenges to its patent licensing model, including potential reductions in royalty rates or changes in the royalty base (e.g., from device-level to chipset-level licensing). These pressures had the potential to disproportionately impact the QTL segment, which derives the majority of its revenues from licensing royalties. By 2024, QCOM continued to rely heavily on the QTL segment, with 'substantially all of QTL's revenues' stemming from licensing royalties tied to mobile handsets. However, the persistence of regulatory scrutiny from 2023 likely forced QCOM to reassess or reinforce its licensing strategies in 2024 to maintain segment performance, despite the risks of reduced revenue, increased transaction costs, and potential restructuring of licensing agreements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: QCOM(2023) \u2192 Licensing Revenues: Regulatory pressures and legal proceedings in 2023 threatened to reduce royalty rates and alter the royalty base, negatively impacting revenue and cash flows.",
        "Hop 2: Licensing Revenues \u2192 QTL Segment: The QTL segment is fundamentally dependent on licensing revenues, particularly from mobile handsets, and any reduction in these revenues would directly impact the segment\u2019s performance.",
        "Hop 3: QTL Segment \u2190 QCOM(2024): In 2024, QCOM's QTL segment remained heavily reliant on licensing royalties, with 'substantially all of QTL's revenues' derived from royalties on mobile handsets, indicating continued exposure to the same regulatory risks identified in 2023."

      "question": "How did the treatment of insurance settlements within the Other segment in 2023 and 2024 affect the comparability of segment-level profitability metrics across years, and what does this imply about the consistency of TXN's resource allocation methodology?",
      "answer": "In 2023 and 2024, insurance settlements were consistently classified under the Other segment as corporate-level adjustments not used in evaluating segment performance or allocating resources. This classification implies that such non-operational gains or losses were excluded from the performance metrics (e.g., operating profit) used by the chief operating decision maker (CODM) to assess segment results and allocate resources. As a result, any fluctuations in insurance settlements between the two years would not impact the reported profitability of the Analog or Embedded Processing segments, thereby preserving the comparability of these segments' performance. However, this also means that the true economic performance of the Other segment\u2014and potentially the company as a whole\u2014might not be fully reflected in the segment-level metrics, which could affect the accuracy of investment and strategic decisions based on these figures.",

        "Hop 2: Other Segment \u2192 Insurance Settlements: Insurance settlements are explicitly called out as items included in the Other segment that are not used in evaluating segment results or allocating resources.",
        "Hop 3: Insurance Settlements \u2190 TXN(2024): In 2024, TXN continues to treat insurance settlements as part of the Other segment and reiterates that the CODM excludes such items when assessing segment performance and allocating resources."

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

      "question": "How did the decrease in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from $2.8 billion in 2023 to $2.4 billion in 2024 reflect the change in AMD's acquisition-related intangible asset base, and what role did full amortization of certain intangibles play in this evolution?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMD reported acquisition-related intangibles of $21,363 million, down from $24,118 million in 2022, indicating ongoing amortization. By 2024, the amortization expense decreased to $2.4 billion from $2.8 billion in 2023, primarily due to certain intangibles being fully amortized in the prior fiscal year. This decrease in amortization expense aligns with the reduction in the carrying value of these intangibles over time. Additionally, the 2022 data referenced under the 'All Other' segment showed $4.2 billion in amortization related to Xilinx, further contextualizing the scale of amortization pressures from prior acquisitions. The reduction in amortization expense in 2024 signals a maturing of the acquisition-related intangible asset base, with fewer remaining assets to amortize following the full write-off of certain components in 2023.",

The increase in gross margin was due to a fav orable shift in rev enue mix of higher Data Center and Client rev enues, lower Gaming rev enue, partially offset by the impact of lower Embedded rev enue.\n\n## Expenses\n\n## Research and Development Expenses\n\nResearch and development expenses of $6.5 billion in 2024 increased by $584 million, or 10%, compared to $5.9 billion in 2023. The increase was primarily due to higher employee-related costs due to an increase in headcount in support of our AI strategy.\n\n## Marketing, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nMarketing, general and administrativ e expenses of $2.8 billion in 2024 increased by $431 million, or 18%, compared to $2.4 billion in 2023. T he increase was primarily due to an increase in go-to-market activ ities to support our rev enue growth.\n\n## Amortization of Acquisition-Related Intangibles\n\nAmortization of acquisition-related intangibles of $2.4 billion for 2024 decreased by $417 million, or 15%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2023.

This occurred despite relatively stable cost of revenue ($4,610M to $4,615M), but due to a significant drop in revenue from $15,359M to $13,040M (-15.1%).

      "question": "How did the change in AMD's Licensing Gain from $34 million in 2023 to its absence in 2024 affect the composition of the All Other category expenses?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AMD reported a Licensing Gain of $34 million, which was explicitly listed as part of the All Other category expenses. This category includes unallocated expenses and credits such as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, stock-based compensation, acquisition-related costs, and licensing gain. In 2024, although the All Other category still includes similar line items like restructuring charges and stock-based compensation, the Licensing Gain is no longer explicitly listed as part of the category composition. This suggests that the Licensing Gain likely decreased or was absent in 2024, which would have increased the overall net expense of the All Other category compared to 2023, assuming other components remained constant. Therefore, the removal of the Licensing Gain from the 2024 disclosures implies a material change in the financial structure of unallocated credits, directly affecting the All Other category's net impact on AMD\u2019s operating performance.",

      "answer": "In 2023, TXN's 'Other' segment reported $1.11 billion in revenue and included environmental costs among other corporate-level items. By 2024, the 'Other' segment's revenue decreased to $947 million, with environmental costs still disclosed as part of the same category. Despite the $163 million decline in revenue, the segment maintained a relatively stable gross profit of $584 million in 2024, compared to an implied gross profit of approximately 52.6% of revenue in 2023 based on the 2024 gross margin structure. This suggests that TXN may have improved cost controls or optimized operations within the 'Other' segment, even as environmental costs remained a disclosed liability.",

          "chunk_text": "The valuation of inventory also requires us to estimate obsolete and excess inventory, as well as inventory that is not of saleable quality. We use the demand forecast to develop our short-term manufacturing plans to enable consistency between inventory valuations and build decisions. For certain new products, we have limited historical data when developing these demand forecasts. We compare the estimate of future demand to work in process and finished goods inventory levels to determine the amount, if any, of obsolete or excess inventory. When our demand forecast for specific products is greater than actual demand and we fail to reduce manufacturing output accordingly, we write off amounts considered to be excess inventory.\n\n## Property, Plant and Equipment\n\nWe compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of assets. We also capitalize interest on borrowings related to eligible capital expenditures. Capitalized interest is added to the cost of qualified assets and depreciated together with that asset cost. We record capital-related government grants earned as a reduction to property, plant and equipment.\n\nWe evaluate the period over which we expect to recover the economic value of our property, plant and equipment, considering factors such as the process technology cadence between node transitions, changes in machinery and equipment technology, and re-use of machinery and tools across each generation of process technology. As we make manufacturing process conversions and other factory planning decisions, we use assumptions involving the use of management judgments regarding the remaining useful lives of assets, primarily process-specific semiconductor manufacturing tools and building improvements. When we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter or longer than we had originally estimated, we adjust the rate of depreciation to reflect the assets' revised useful lives.\n\nAssets are categorized and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under-performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations, significant negative industry or economic trends, and significant changes or planned changes in our use and fungibility of the assets. If an asset grouping carrying value is not recoverable through the related undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired.\n\n## Fair Value\n\nWhen determining fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, as well as assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Our financial assets are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis, except for equity securities measured using the measurement alternative, equity method investments, and grants receivable. We assess fair value hierarchy levels for our issued debt and fixed-income investment portfolio based on the underlying instrument type.\n\nThe three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value are:\n\n- Level 1. Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. We evaluate security-specific market data when determining whether a market is active.\n- Level 2. Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in less active markets, or model-derived valuations. All significant inputs used in our valuations, such as discounted cash flows, are observable or can be derived principally from or corroborated with observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. We use LIBOR-based yield curves, overnight indexed swap curves, currency spot and forward rates, and credit ratings as significant inputs in our valuations. Level 2 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices, as well as quoted prices that were adjusted for security-specific restrictions. When we use nonbinding market consensus prices, we corroborate them with quoted market prices for similar instruments or compare them to output from internally developed pricing models such as discounted cash flow models.\n- Level 3. Unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities. We monitor and review the inputs and results of these valuation models to help ensure the fair value measurements are reasonable and consistent with market experience in similar asset classes. Level 3 inputs also include non-binding market consensus prices or non-binding broker quotes that we were unable to corroborate with observable market data.\n\n## Debt Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid debt investments with original maturities from the date of purchase of three months or less as cash equivalents. Cash equivalents can include investments such as corporate debt, financial institution instruments, government debt, and reverse repurchase agreements.\n\nMarketable debt investments are generally designated as trading assets when a market risk is economically hedged at inception with a related derivative instrument, or when the marketable debt investment itself is used to economically hedge currency exchange rate risk from remeasurement. Investments designated as trading assets are reported at fair value. Gains or losses on these investments arising from changes in fair value due to interest rate and currency market fluctuations and credit market volatility, largely offset by losses or gains on the related derivative instruments and balance sheet remeasurement, are recorded in interest and other, net.\n\nFinancial Statements\n\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n78",

However, if these third parties fail to adopt or adhere to adequate data security practices, or in the event of a breach of their networks, our workers' data may be improperly accessed, used or disclosed.\n\nA breach of data privacy may cause significant disruption of our business operations. Failure to adequately maintain and update our security systems could materially adversely affect our operations and our ability to maintain worker confidence. Failure to prevent unauthorized access to electronic and other confidential information, IT outages, data loss and data breaches could materially adversely affect our financial condition, our competitive position and operating results.\n\n## Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us.\n\nWe  typically  sell  our  products  pursuant  to  individual  purchase  orders.  We  generally  do  not  have  long-term  supply arrangements  with  our  customers  or  minimum  purchase  requirements  except  that  orders  generally  must  be  for standard pack quantities. Generally, our customers may cancel orders for standard products more than 30 days prior to shipment without incurring significant fees. We base our inventory levels in part on customers' estimates of demand for their products, which may not accurately predict the quantity or type of our products that our customers will want in the future or ultimately end up purchasing. Our ability to forecast demand is even further complicated when our products are  sold  indirectly  through  downstream  channel  distributors  and  customers,  as  our  forecasts  for  demand  are  then based  on  estimates  provided  by  multiple  parties  throughout  the  downstream  channel.  For  instance,  we  have experienced and continue to experience increased demand for our products. To the extent we fail to forecast demand and product mix accurately or are unable to increase production or secure sufficient capacity and there is a mismatch between supply and demand for our products, it could limit our ability to meet customer demand and have a material adverse effect on our business. Many of our markets are characterized by short product lifecycles, which can lead to rapid obsolescence and price erosion. In addition, our customers may change their inventory practices on short notice for  any  reason.  We  may  build  inventories  during  periods  of  anticipated  growth,  and  the  cancellation  or  deferral  of product orders or overproduction due to failure of anticipated orders to materialize could result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of inventory and an adverse effect on gross margins. Our customers may also experience a shortage of, or delay in receiving, certain components to build their products, which in turn may affect the demand for or the timing of our products. For instance, our OEMs have and continue to experience industry-wide challenges securing matched component sets to build their products.\n\nFactors that may result in excess or obsolete inventory, which could result in write-downs of the value of our inventory, a reduction in the average selling price or a reduction in our gross margin include: a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products; a production or design defect in our products; a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements; a failure to accurately estimate customer demand for our products, including for our older products as our new products are introduced; or our competitors introducing new products or taking aggressive pricing actions.\n\n## Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner is dependent upon third-party intellectual property.\n\nIn  the  design  and  development  of  new  and  enhanced  products,  we  rely  on  third-party  intellectual  property  such  as development and testing tools for software and hardware. Furthermore, certain product features may rely on intellectual property acquired from third parties. The design requirements necessary to meet customer demand for more features and  greater  functionality  from  semiconductor  products  may  exceed  the  capabilities  of  the  third-party  intellectual property or development or testing tools available to us. If the third-party intellectual property that we use becomes unavailable, is not available with required functionality or performance in the time frame, manufacturing technology, or price point needed for our new products or fails to produce designs that meet customer demands, our business could be materially adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## The development and implementation of new semiconductor products and manufacturing technologies are subject to many risks and uncertainties.\n\nWe are continually engaged in the development of next-generation technologies. Forecasting our progress and schedule for developing advanced nodes and other technologies is challenging, and at times we encounter unexpected delays due to the complexity of interactions among steps in the manufacturing process, challenges in using new materials or new production equipment, and other issues. Diagnosing defects in our manufacturing processes often takes a long time, as manufacturing throughput times can delay our receipt of data about defects and the effectiveness of fixes, and defects can be more serious and difficult to resolve than initially  anticipated.\n\nWe are not always successful or efficient in developing or implementing new process nodes and manufacturing processes. We experienced significant delays in implementing our 10nm process technology, and in 2020, we encountered a defect mode in the development of our 7nm process technology that resulted in delays relative to our prior expectations. In 2022, Intel's 4th Gen Intel X eon Scalable processor was delayed to allow for more platform and product validation time. These delays have allowed competitors using third-party foundries, such as TSM C, to benefit from advancements in manufacturing processes introduced ahead of us, including improvements in performance, energy efficiency, and other features, which have helped increase the competitiveness of their products. On the product side, we have had limited market success with our accelerator offerings, and in 2024 we recognized $922 million in Gaudi A I accelerator inventory-related charges. We may experience greater adverse competitive impacts in the event of further delays in the development of future manufacturing process technologies and products or lack of market success with our offerings.\n\nOur efforts to innovate involve significant expense and carry inherent risks, including difficulties in designing and developing next-generation process and packaging technologies, and investments in manufacturing assets and facilities that are made years in advance. We cannot guarantee that we will realize the expected benefits of next-generation process technologies, including the expected cost, performance, power, and density advantages, or that we will achieve an adequate return on our capital and R&amp;D investments, particularly as the development of new nodes has grown increasingly expensive. In such circumstances, we may be required to write down the value of some of our manufacturing assets and facilities, increasing our expenses, as we were required to do in the third quarter of 2024 with respect to the Intel 7 process node.\n\nRisks inherent in the development of next-generation process technologies include production timing delays, lower-than-anticipated manufacturing yields, longer manufacturing throughput times, failure to achieve expected performance, power, and area improvements, and product defects and errata (deviations from published specifications). Production timing delays have at times caused us to miss customer product design windows, which can result in lost revenue opportunities and damage to our customer relationships. Furthermore, when the introduction of next-generation process nodes is delayed, adding cores or other competitive features to our products can result in larger die size products, manufacturing supply constraints, and increased product costs. Lower manufacturing yields and longer manufacturing throughput times, compared to previous process nodes, can increase our product costs, adversely affect our gross margins, and contribute to manufacturing supply constraints. A  new process node typically has higher costs compared to a mature node due to factors that include higher depreciation costs and lower yields, and costs and yields at times do not improve at the same rate as on prior nodes. In addition, the cost of new leading-edge process nodes continues to increase at a higher rate relative to legacy process nodes due to a number of factors, including the cost of procuring and operating advanced manufacturing equipment. As the die size of our products has increased and our manufacturing process nodes have increased the number of transistors per die, our products and manufacturing processes have grown increasingly complex and more susceptible to product defects and errata, which at times also contribute to production timing delays and lower yields that may also increase our costs to manufacture and warranty our products.\n\nOur disaggregated design strategy poses increased logistical risks and challenges, particularly where we decide to manufacture different product components on different process technologies, including third-party foundries' process technologies. To combine components in a single package, they need to be manufactured on a timely basis and in sufficient quantities, while the manufacturing processes we utilize may have differing yields, throughput times, and capacity constraints. We may be required to safely store some components pending the manufacture of others. Delays or quality issues with one component could limit our ability  to manufacture the entire completed product. In addition, the packaging technologies used to combine these components can increase our costs and may introduce additional complexity and quality issues. To the extent we are unable to manage these risks, our ability to timely supply competitive products can be harmed and our costs could increase.\n\nFrom time to time, disruptions in the production process result from errors; defects in materials; delays in obtaining or revising permits and licenses; interruptions in our supply of materials, resources, or production equipment; adverse changes in equipment productivity; and disruptions at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities due to accidents, maintenance issues, power interruptions, equipment malfunctions, or unsafe working conditions-all of which could affect the timing of production ramps and yields and could result in production timing delays. Production issues periodically lead to increased costs and affect our ability  to meet product demand, which can adversely impact our business and the results of operations.\n\nRisk Factors and Other Key Inform ation\n\n33",

      "answer": "Cisco's treatment of revenue recognition timing for noncancelable contracts remained consistent from 2023 to 2024, as both filings explicitly state that unbilled contract revenue represents noncancelable contracts for which the company has not invoiced, has an obligation to perform, and for which revenue has not yet been recognized. The identical disclosure language across both years indicates no change in the underlying revenue recognition policy or timing for these commitments.",

        "Hop 2: Noncancelable Contracts \u2192 Unbilled Contract Revenue: The relationship is defined by Cisco\u2019s policy that unbilled contract revenue arises from noncancelable contracts where performance obligations remain unfulfilled.",
