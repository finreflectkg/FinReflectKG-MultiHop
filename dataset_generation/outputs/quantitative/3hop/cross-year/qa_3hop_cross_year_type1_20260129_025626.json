      "answer": "In 2023, foreign currency effects had an unfavorable impact of $206 million on CVX's net charges, while in 2024, this swung to a favorable impact of $587 million. This $793 million turnaround indicates a significant shift in CVX's exposure to exchange rate fluctuations, with foreign currency movements becoming a net positive contributor to net charges in 2024 after being a drag in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, divestments were explicitly called out as a key factor reducing natural gas production, with 5.268 billion cubic feet per day of production in consolidated subsidiaries declining to 4.902 billion cubic feet per day in 2023. This 6.9% decrease in natural gas production from divestments indicates a continued strategic reduction in upstream assets, particularly in regions like the United States where production dropped from 2,531 million cubic feet per day in 2022 to 2,292 million cubic feet per day in 2023. The consistent mention of divestments as a production driver in both years shows a deliberate portfolio optimization strategy rather than a temporary adjustment.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Recent Business Environment\n\nDuring 2024, the price of crude oil remained near the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range (2010-2019), as markets remained balanced. Through the first nine months of the year, natural gas prices declined towards the middle of the 10-year range due to strong supply and lower demand. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices increased on rising demand driven by colder weather in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nRefining margins declined in 2024 from high 2023 levels as increased supply from industry capacity additions outpaced record global demand and remain near the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins improved slightly in 2024 but remained well below the 10-year range driven by over-supply, primarily in Asia.\n\nThe general rate of inflation across major countries peaked in 2022, rising from already elevated levels in 2021, due to additional impacts on energy and other commodities from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Inflation has trended down since 2023 as a result of aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks and slowing  global  economic  growth.  However,  there  has  been  significant  variation  on  the  pace  of  change  across  OECD  and  non-OECD  countries.  With  inflation gradually approaching the official targets in the  U.S. and  Eurozone, the  Federal  Reserve and the  European  Central  Bank began lowering interest rates in 2024. Meanwhile, China has been under persistent deflationary pressure since 2023.\n\nThe Corporation closely monitors market trends and works to mitigate both operating and capital cost impacts in all price environments. Organizational changes implemented over the past several years enabled the Corporation to capture $12.1 billion of structural cost savings versus 2019, including $2.4 billion of savings during 2024, through increased operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-saving measures. The Company sees additional opportunities in areas such as supply chain efficiency, improved maintenance and turnarounds, modernized data management, centralization of activities, and simplified business processes. These savings are key drivers to further reduce our structural costs by $6 billion by 2030, thereby improving the earnings power of the Corporation. ( 1 )\n\nRefer to Frequently Used Terms for definition of structural cost savings. (1)\n\n## Transportation of Kazakhstan Production\n\nThe Corporation holds a 25 percent interest in Tengizchevroil, LLP (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan, and a 16.8 percent working interest in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Oil production from those operations is exported primarily through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which the Corporation holds a 7.5 percent interest. CPC traverses parts of Kazakhstan and Russia to tanker-loading facilities on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. In the event geopolitical issues escalate in the region, including ongoing military conflict, it is possible that the transportation of Kazakhstan oil through the CPC pipeline could be disrupted, curtailed, temporarily suspended, or otherwise restricted. In such a case, the Corporation could experience a loss of cash flows of uncertain duration from its operations in Kazakhstan. For reference, after-tax  earnings related to the Corporation's interests in Kazakhstan in 2024 were approx imately $1.9 billion, and its share of combined oil and gas production was approximately 260 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil's ROCE was 24.9%, calculated using an average capital employed of $228,404 million. By 2024, the ROCE had decreased to 12.7%, while the average capital employed increased significantly to $278,102 million.

      "question": "How did the change in COP's U.S. Pension Benefits from $369 million in 2022 to $176 million in 2024 relate to the shift in the Rate of Compensation Increase, which rose from 4.29% in 2022 to 5.00% in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, COP reported U.S. Pension Benefits of $369 million, with a Rate of Compensation Increase of 4.29%. By 2024, the U.S. Pension Benefits had decreased to $176 million, while the Rate of Compensation Increase had risen to 5.00%. This inverse relationship suggests that despite a lower pension liability, COP applied a higher assumed rate of compensation increase in its pension calculations. This could indicate a strategic shift in actuarial assumptions, potentially reflecting more optimistic projections for employee salary growth or a recalibration of long-term benefit obligations.",

        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 U.S. Pension Benefits: COP disclosed $369 million in U.S. Pension Benefits in 2022.",

        "Hop 3: Rate of Compensation Increase \u2190 COP(2024): By 2024, COP used a 5.00% Rate of Compensation Increase in its pension disclosures, even though U.S. Pension Benefits had dropped to $176 million."

      "answer": "In 2022, COP's Lower 48 Segment experienced asset impairments due to declining fair values, which were evaluated using internal discounted cash flow models. By 2024, the Lower 48 Segment saw a significant increase in Production and Operating Expenses\u2014up $1,058 million\u2014driven by higher lease operating expenses and transportation costs. This increase was further influenced by higher volumes in the Lower 48 and Canada segments, as well as acquisition-related expenses from the Marathon Oil deal.

Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

This increase of $34,662 million contributed to a higher average capital base, which, when combined with a decline in earnings excluding financing costs (from $36,561 million in 2023 to $35,234 million in 2024), resulted in a drop in ROCE from 15.0% to 12.7%.

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

          "chunk_text": "In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

      "question": "How did the changes in asset valuation practices for noncore assets in COP's Lower 48 segment in 2022 influence the structure and fair value estimation of contingent payments tied to the Surmont acquisition in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, COP disclosed impairments for noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment, where fair values were estimated using internal discounted cash flow models incorporating unobservable inputs like future production estimates, long-term commodity price outlooks, and discount rates consistent with market participants. These valuation practices highlighted challenges in estimating asset values under uncertainty, particularly for noncore or undeveloped assets. In 2023, COP disclosed that the contingent payments related to the Surmont acquisition were also valued using an income approach that relied heavily on unobservable inputs, specifically the estimated commodity price outlook derived from a combination of external pricing services and internal forecasts. The structure of these contingent payments\u2014tied to WCS pricing above $52 per barrel and adjusted for production targets\u2014reflects a deliberate effort to align liability valuation with commodity price volatility, a practice likely informed by the earlier challenges in valuing impaired assets in the Lower 48 segment. This suggests a strategic evolution in how COP structures contingent obligations to reflect asset valuation uncertainties observed in prior years.",

In the Alaska segment, 2021 production contributed less than 1% of consolidated natural gas production, but the segment showed signs of improvement, including new wells coming online and better performance in key areas like the Greater Prudhoe Area. By 2024, COP had significantly increased its exploration activity in Alaska, recording a $31 million before-tax dry hole expense for the Bear-1 exploration well. This suggests a strategic shift toward oil-rich exploration in Alaska, supported by earlier improvements in production performance and reduced reliance on Canadian natural gas, which coincided with a $129 million impairment of aged, suspended wells at Surmont in the Canada segment in late 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Alaska segment contributed 15% of COP's consolidated liquids production and reported earnings of $1,778 million, a decline from $2,352 million in 2022 due to lower oil prices and higher operating costs. During the same year, COP incurred a $31 million dry hole expense from the Bear-1 exploration well in Alaska. No new dry hole expenses were recorded in Alaska in 2024; however, the segment's production had already been declining, with a 5 MBOED decrease in 2023 compared to 2022 due to normal field decline, only partially offset by new wells. This suggests that unsuccessful exploration efforts like Bear-1 may have contributed to the segment's reduced production potential and earnings performance, highlighting a link between exploration outcomes and segment performance over the two-year period.",

In the 2024 filing, this projection slightly decreased to $709 million for the same time frame. This $7 million decrease suggests a minor downward adjustment in Chevron's long-term non-pension benefit liabilities, which could indicate either a refinement in actuarial assumptions, a strategic decision to moderate future benefit costs, or a reflection of improved demographic or economic forecasts.

      "answer": "In 2022, COP's Canada segment received contingent payments calculated at $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeded $52 CAD per barrel, with the payment term ending on May 16, 2022. By 2023, the Canada segment remained operationally active, but no new contingent payment structure for this segment was disclosed in the evidence, suggesting a reduced or concluded financial linkage tied to WCS crude price thresholds. This indicates a potential decline in COP's exposure to WCS crude price volatility in 2023 compared to 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is presented for illustration purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the transactions been completed on January 1, 2020, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results of the combined entity.  The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2020 is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of ConocoPhillips with the results of Concho and the assets acquired from Shell.  The pro forma results do not include transaction-related costs, nor any cost savings anticipated as a result of the transactions.  The pro forma results include adjustments from Concho's historical results to reverse impairment expense of $ 10.5 billion and $1.9 billion related to oil and gas properties and goodwill, respectively. Other adjustments made relate primarily to DD&amp;A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to properties, plants and equipment.  We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are  properly reflected.\n\n## Announced Acquisitions\n\nIn December 2021, we announced that we have notified Origin Energy that we are exercising our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG from Origin Energy for $ 1.645 billion, which will be funded from cash on the balance sheet, before customary adjustments.  The effective date of the transaction will be July 1, 2020 with closing anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2022 subject to Australian government approval.   See Note 4 and Note 7 .\n\n## Assets Sold\n\nIn 2020, we completed the sale of our Australia -West asset and operations.  The sales agreement entitled us to a $200 million payment upon a final investment decision (FID) of the Barossa development project.  On March 30, 2021, FID was announced and as such, we recognized a $200 million gain on disposition in the first quarter of 2021. The purchaser failed to pay the FID bonus when due.  We have commenced an arbitration proceeding against the purchaser to enforce our contractual right to the $ 200 million, plus interest accruing from the due date.  Results of operations related to this transaction are reflected in our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 11 .\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for approximately $250 million after customary adjustments, recognizing a before-tax gain on sale of approximately $58 million.  We also completed the sale of our noncore exploration interests in Argentina, recognizing a beforetax loss on disposition of $179 million.  Results of operations for Argentina were reported in our Other International segment.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded contingent payments of $ 369 million relating to previous dispositions.  The contingent payments are recorded as gain on disposition on our consolidated income statement and are reflected within our Canada and Lower 48 segments.  In our Canada segment, the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel .  The term for contingent payments in our Canada segment ends on May 16, 2022.  In our Lower 48 segment, the contingent payment, paid on an annual basis, is calculated monthly at $7 million per month in which the U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per MMBTU .  The term for contingent payments in our Lower 48 segment goes through 2023. No contingent payments were recorded in 2020.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell two subsidiaries holding our Indonesia assets and operations to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion, before customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2021.  The subsidiaries hold our 54 percent interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a35 percent shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company.  The net carrying value is approximately $0.4 billion, which consists primarily of PP&amp;E.  The assets met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter,  and as of December 31, 2021, we have reclassified $ 0.3 billion of PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and $ 0.1 billion of noncurrent ARO to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet.  The before-tax earnings associated with our Indonesia subsidiaries were $ 604 million, $394 million and $512 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively .  This transaction is expected to close in early 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other specific conditions precedent.  Results of operations for the subsidiaries to be sold are reported within our Asia Pacific segment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CVX reported an Interest Coverage Ratio of 49.0, calculated using income before tax, interest and debt expense, and amortization of capitalized interest, minus $42 million in Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests, and divided by $617 million in total financing interest and debt costs. By 2024, Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests had increased to $88 million, reducing the subtotal for calculation from $30,234 million in 2023 to $28,226 million in 2024, despite a rise in income before tax. This led to a decline in the Interest Coverage Ratio to 36.5, indicating a reduced buffer for servicing debt.

      "answer": "The reduction in dry hole expenses in the Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment from $102 million in 2022 to $40 million in 2024 indicates a strategic shift in COP's exploration approach, focusing on fewer, more targeted exploration wells. In 2022, COP incurred significant dry hole expenses due to four operated and one partner-operated well in Norway. In contrast, by 2024, the company reported dry hole expenses of $40 million, which were attributed to only two partner-operated wells in the Alvheim area and one suspended discovery well in the North Sea. This suggests a deliberate move toward reducing exposure to high-risk exploration by focusing on fewer wells and potentially partnering more with other operators. This aligns with COP's broader strategy to lower exploration costs, as highlighted in 2021 when lower dry hole expenses were cited as a key factor in improved earnings.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 Exploration Expenses: In 2022, COP incurred $102 million in dry hole expenses in the Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment from four operated and one partner-operated well.",
        "Hop 2: Exploration Expenses \u2192 Dry Hole Expenses: Dry hole expenses are a component of exploration expenses and directly impact financial performance, as noted in COP's 2021 earnings explanation where lower dry hole costs improved profitability.",
        "Hop 3: Dry Hole Expenses \u2190 COP(2024): By 2024, COP's dry hole expenses in the same region had dropped to $40 million, attributed to only two partner-operated wells and one suspended well, indicating a more conservative exploration approach."

      "answer": "In 2023, COP's Lower 48 segment experienced asset impairments due to declining fair values, which were written down to reflect fair value based on internal discounted cash flow models. By 2024, DD&A costs in the Lower 48 segment increased by $562 million, driven by higher production ($250 million), higher DD&A rates ($181 million), and the Marathon Oil acquisition ($139 million). This increase in DD&A, combined with lower commodity prices reducing revenues by $904 million, contributed to a decline in Lower 48 earnings from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024. Despite production growth of 85 MBOED and the addition of Marathon Oil assets, the financial performance was negatively impacted by these higher costs and lower prices.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "answer": "Chevron's net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased from $42 million in 2023 to an implied lower value in 2024, as the interest coverage ratio dropped from 49.0 in 2023 to an implied lower ratio in 2024, despite maintaining the same calculation methodology that subtracts noncontrolling interest income. This suggests that even with a smaller deduction for noncontrolling interests in 2024, other factors such as lower pre-tax income or higher interest costs likely contributed to the reduced interest coverage ratio, indicating a weakened ability to service debt compared to the prior year.",

      "question": "Given ExxonMobil's declining earnings from $55.74 billion in 2022 to $36.01 billion in 2023 despite an increase in average capital employed to $243.44 billion, how might their 2024 capital deployment strategy reflect a response to reduced ROCE efficiency, especially since the company continues to emphasize ROCE as a key measure of capital productivity?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's ROCE for 2023 stood at 15.0%, a significant drop from 24.9% in 2022, driven by declining earnings from $55.74 billion to $36.01 billion while average capital employed increased from $228.40 billion to $243.44 billion. Given that ROCE is defined as earnings excluding financing costs divided by average capital employed \u2014 a metric Chevron also describes as measuring annual earnings relative to historical investments \u2014 ExxonMobil\u2019s 2024 disclosures emphasize ROCE as a core productivity metric. However, the lack of a specific ROCE figure in 2024 filings, combined with the downward trend in earnings, suggests that the company may have adjusted its capital deployment strategy to improve capital efficiency, potentially through divestitures, project rationalization, or a shift toward higher-return investments.",

        "Hop 1: XOM(2023) \u2192 Average Capital Employed: XOM disclosed $243.44 billion in average capital employed for 2023, up from $228.40 billion in 2022, while earnings dropped from $55.74 billion to $36.01 billion.",
        "Hop 2: Average Capital Employed \u2192 ROCE: ROCE is defined as earnings excluding financing costs divided by average capital employed, reflecting how effectively capital is used to generate returns.",
        "Hop 3: ROCE \u2190 XOM(2024): In 2024, XOM reaffirmed ROCE as a key productivity metric but did not report a specific ROCE figure, implying a potential strategic shift to address declining capital efficiency."

From the perspective of the business segments, ROCE is annual business segment earnings divided by average business segment capital employed (average of beginning and end-of-year amounts). These segment earnings include ExxonMobil's share of segment earnings of equity companies, consistent with our capital employed definition, and exclude the cost of financing. The Corporation's total ROCE is net  income  attributable  to  Ex x onMobil  ex cluding  the  after-tax   cost  of  financing,  divided  by  total  corporate  average  capital  employed.  The  Corporation  has consistently applied its ROCE definition for many years and views it as one of the best measures of historical capital productivity in our capital-intensive, long-term industry. Additional measures, which are more cash flow based, are used to make investment decisions.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP's Alaska segment reported earnings of $1,778 million, which was a decline compared to 2022 due to lower realized crude oil prices and higher operating expenses. Despite these challenges, the segment contributed to COP's overall natural gas production, which stood at 38 million cubic feet daily in 2023. By 2024, Alaska's natural gas production slightly increased to 39 million cubic feet daily, indicating a modest improvement in production efficiency or operational execution. This slight production increase in 2024, although not a significant jump, reflects a continuation of the segment's contribution to the company's overall natural gas output, despite the earlier year's financial headwinds.",

      "question": "How did the increase in COP's Lower 48 production volumes in 2024, driven by the Marathon Oil acquisition, impact the segment's earnings compared to 2022 production levels?",
      "answer": "In 2022, COP reported a total production of 2,775 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) from the Lower 48 segment, which contributed significantly to the company's overall reserves. By 2024, the Lower 48 segment saw an 85 MBOED increase in average production, largely due to new wells in key basins and the acquisition of Marathon Oil, which added approximately 334 MBOED in December 2024 alone. Despite this volume increase, Lower 48 earnings decreased from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024, primarily due to lower commodity prices and higher operating costs, including $562 million in increased DD&A and $431 million in higher production expenses. This shows that while production volumes rose significantly from 2022 to 2024, the financial performance of the Lower 48 segment declined due to external pricing pressures and integration costs from the Marathon acquisition.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "question": "How did the 2022 production decline in the Lower 48 segment impact COP's 2024 earnings and asset valuation strategies within the same segment, particularly in light of the Marathon Oil acquisition?",
      "answer": "In 2022, COP's Lower 48 segment experienced a production decline of 142 million barrels of oil equivalent, which negatively impacted reserve levels and operational performance. By 2024, this trend was countered through the acquisition of Marathon Oil, which added 334 MBOED in December 2024 alone, boosting total average production by 85 MBOED for the year. However, despite the volume increase, Lower 48 earnings dropped from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024, partly due to lower commodity prices and higher DD&A expenses driven by increased production and acquisition-related costs. The Marathon acquisition also led to a provisional fair value recognition of $13.2 billion in proved and $10.8 billion in unproved oil and gas properties, signaling a strategic shift toward asset expansion and long-term valuation growth in the Lower 48 despite short-term earnings pressures.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "Chevron maintained an identical disclosure methodology for defining net and gross wells in both 2022 and 2023, as both years explicitly state that gross wells represent the total number of wells in which Chevron has an ownership interest, while net wells reflect the sum of Chevron's ownership interest in those gross wells. However, since neither year provides actual numerical counts of net or gross wells, the consistency in definition alone limits the transparency of Chevron\u2019s upstream asset reporting, making it difficult to assess changes in operational scale or ownership structure.",

      "question": "How did the decrease in Chevron's interest and debt expense from $712 million in 2022 to $469 million in 2023 impact the company's interest coverage ratio, and what does this trend suggest about its debt servicing capacity over time?",
      "answer": "Chevron's interest and debt expense decreased from $712 million in 2022 to $469 million in 2023, which directly contributed to an increase in the interest coverage ratio from 29.0 in 2022 to 49.0 in 2023. This trend indicates a significant improvement in Chevron's ability to service its debt, as the interest coverage ratio reflects income before tax plus interest and debt expense, amortization of capitalized interest, and less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. The lower financing costs combined with higher pre-tax income ($21,639 million in 2022 to $29,584 million in 2023) strengthened the company's financial flexibility and reduced its vulnerability to interest rate fluctuations.",

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

By 2023, employee benefit costs had decreased further, contributing to a $768 million drop in net charges, though this was partially offset by a $206 million unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects.

By 2023, this contribution increased to 64%, driven by new wells in the Delaware Basin, Midland Basin, Eagle Ford, and Bakken. Despite this 78 MBOED production increase, 2023 earnings from the segment dropped to $6,461 million from $11,015 million in 2022, partly due to lower realized commodity prices and higher DD&A expenses. These financial pressures were compounded by asset impairments, as noncore assets in the Lower 48 were written down due to declining fair values estimated using internal discounted cash flow models. Thus, while production grew significantly due to prior-year acquisitions and development activity, the combination of lower prices and asset write-downs materially impacted profitability.",

There was no appraisal activity in 2021. In August 2021, an Alaska federal judge vacated the U.S. government's approval granted to our planned Willow project previously approved by the BLM in October 2020.  The Department of Justice did not appeal the decision and neither did we.  We are actively supporting the BLM and Department of Interior as they conduct the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement process to address issues highlighted by the federal district court.  In the interim, we are continuing with FEED work in service of a final investment decision.\n\nThe Stony Hill 1 well located to the east of the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit within the NPR-A was plugged and abandoned in 2021 and expensed as a dry hole.\n\nA 3D seismic survey covering 234 square miles was completed in 2020 on state and federal lands.  We are currently evaluating this seismic data for future exploration opportunities.\n\nIn late 2021, the Coyote Brookian topset exploration prospect in the Kuparuk River Unit was tested with a near vertical sidetrack from an existing wellbore.  The well was fracture stimulated and will undergo well testing early in 2022 to confirm longer term deliverability.\n\n## Transportation\n\nWe transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of Trans  -Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).  We have a 29.5 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in and operate the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.\n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double -hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels, as necessary.  The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S.\n\n## Lower 48\n\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the Gulf of Mexico.  The segment is organized into the Permian and Gulf Coast and Rockies business units with a portfolio of low cost of supply, short cycle time, resource-rich unconventional plays, and conventional production from legacy assets. Based on 2021 production volumes, the Lower 48 is the company's largest segment and contributed 55 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 64 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\nIn 2021, we completed two acquisitions significantly increasing our Permian position in the Lower 48.  On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho adding complementary acreage across the Delaware and Midland basins.  On December 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Shell's Delaware Basin position adding significant Texas acreage in the Delaware Basin.  The accounting close date used for reporting purposes of the Shell transaction was December 31, 2021.  For additional information related to these acquisitions, see Note 3 .",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron emphasized a structured reserves estimation process involving asset teams and a Reserves Advisory Committee, with depletion tied directly to proved developed reserves through the unit-of-production method. By 2024, the company faced a 58 million BOE decrease in proved reserves due to lower natural gas prices in North America, which directly impacted the economic viability of certain properties. This led to a notable shift in reserve management, evidenced by a 464 million BOE transfer to proved developed reserves in the U.S., particularly in the Midland and Delaware basins, DJ basin, and Gulf of America, as Chevron prioritized faster monetization of existing assets. The evolution from a controlled estimation framework in 2022 to a more reactive strategy in 2024\u2014driven by market conditions\u2014shows how Chevron adjusted its approach to natural gas reserves in response to external pricing pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX(2022) \u2192 Natural Gas Reserves: Chevron used a formal reserves estimation process involving asset teams and a Reserves Advisory Committee, with proved reserves directly influencing depreciation and depletion expenses via the unit-of-production method.",
        "Hop 2: Natural Gas Reserves \u2192 Proved Developed Reserves: Natural gas reserves are a component of proved developed reserves, which are actively produced and factored into depletion calculations.",
        "Hop 3: Proved Developed Reserves \u2190 CVX(2024): In 2024, Chevron reported a 58 million BOE decrease in proved reserves due to lower North American prices and responded with significant transfers (464 million BOE) to proved developed reserves in key U.S. basins."

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nThe Impact of Proved Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net\n\nAs  described  in  Notes  1  and  18  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company's  upstream  property,  plant  and equipment, net balance was $130.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $16.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude  oil  and  natural  gas  producing  properties,  except  mineral  interests,  are  expensed  using  the  unit-of-production  method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral  interests  are  recognized  using  the  unit-of-production  method  by  individual  field  as  the  related  proved  reserves  are produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Company's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. Reserves are estimated by Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the Company's earth scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as 'management's specialists').\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management's specialists, when developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements. These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to management's estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. The work of management's specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for  using  this  work,  the  specialists'  qualifications  were  understood  and  the  Company's  relationship  with  the  specialists  was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists' findings.\n\n.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nSan Francisco, California February 24, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1935.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Alaska segment contributed 15% of COP's consolidated liquids production, highlighting its significance in the company's upstream portfolio. During the same year, the Europe, Middle East and North Africa (EMEA) segment accounted for 9% of consolidated liquids production. By 2024, COP had shifted focus toward exploration in EMEA, recording $40 million in dry hole expenses, including $22 million in the Alvheim area of the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. This indicates a strategic reallocation of resources from a historically strong liquids-producing region (Alaska) toward exploration activities in EMEA, suggesting a pivot toward future growth opportunities in established international basins.",

      "answer": "Chevron's natural gas realization dropped significantly from $1.67/MCF in 2023 to $1.03/MCF in 2024, a decline of 38%. This was steeper than the broader industry trend, as natural gas prices fell from $4.26/MCF in 2023 to $4.99/MCF in 2024, indicating a 17% increase in market prices. The divergence suggests that Chevron may have been selling more natural gas in regions with lower realized prices or under long-term contracts with fixed pricing, which would explain why their realization moved counter to the overall market trend.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Chevron's International Income Before Tax increased by $13.72 billion compared to 2020, primarily due to higher upstream realizations and the absence of impairments. This surge in income led to a significant rise in international income tax expense from a benefit of $308 million in 2020 to a charge of $4.35 billion in 2021. However, by 2023, upstream realizations had declined, resulting in a decrease in total income before tax. This drop contributed to a $5,893 million reduction in income tax expense compared to 2022. The relationship highlights how fluctuations in upstream realizations directly influence both pre-tax income and corresponding tax liabilities across different reporting periods.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron's All Other segment, which includes Insurance Operations, saw net charges decrease by $768 million, driven by lower employee benefit costs and higher interest income. However, by 2024, this trend reversed sharply, with net charges increasing by $462 million due to higher employee benefit costs, severance charges, and lower interest income. This deterioration coincided with the company's announcement of $2\u20133 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. As part of this initiative, Chevron recorded $980 million in restructuring costs in Q4 2024, of which $274 million was specifically attributed to the All Other segment. This indicates that the worsening financial performance of the segment, including its Insurance Operations, likely contributed to the decision to initiate restructuring aimed at reducing ongoing operational costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVX(2023) \u2192 Insurance Operations: Net charges decreased by $768 million, indicating improved efficiency or cost control in the segment.",
        "Hop 2: Insurance Operations \u2192 All Other: Insurance Operations is a component of the broader All Other segment, which includes various corporate and administrative functions.",
        "Hop 3: All Other \u2190 CVX(2024): In 2024, the All Other segment experienced a $462 million increase in net charges and was directly impacted by $274 million of the $980 million in restructuring costs, signaling strategic action in response to deteriorating performance."

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's 2023 oversight by the Global Reserves and Resources Group, which maintained rigorous internal controls and technical evaluations with an average staff experience of over 15 years in reserves assessment, directly shaped the 2024 proved reserves reporting. The 2024 reserves reporting continued to rely on the same structured methodology, including 3-D and 4-D seismic data, reservoir modeling, and strict approval thresholds. However, the 2024 proved reserves were negatively impacted by sustained low oil prices, which reduced ExxonMobil's capital spending and constrained partner funding for joint projects. This external pressure, referenced in both 2023 and 2024 filings, altered the execution of development projects that had been anticipated in 2023, resulting in variability in actual production volumes and reserves additions in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from  year  to  year  due  to  the  timing  of  individual  project  start-ups;  operational  outages;  reservoir  performance;  regulatory  changes;  the  impact  of  fiscal  and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; international trade patterns and relations; and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nThe estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of reservoir and well performance. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in E stablishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2024\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2024 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn  some  circumstances,  where  appropriate  analog  reservoirs  were  available,  reservoir  parameters  from  these  analogs  were  used  to  increase  the  quality  of  and confidence in the reserves estimates.\n\n## C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves\n\nExxonMobil  has  a  dedicated  G lobal  Reserves  and  Resources  group  that  provides  technical  oversight  and  is  separate  from  the  operating  organization.  Primary responsibilities  of  this  group  include  oversight  of  the  reserves  estimation  process  for  compliance  with  Securities  and  Ex change  Commission  (SEC)  rules  and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of ExxonMobil's proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil's proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The current G lobal Reserves and Resources Manager has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in Engineering, and serves on the Oil and G as Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold degrees in either Engineering or Geology.\n\nThe  Global  Reserves  and  Resources  group  maintains  a  central  database  containing  the  official  company  reserves  estimates.  Appropriate  controls,  including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system's controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long-standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and Resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron assumed a 4.29% rate of compensation increase for U.S. pension benefits, as disclosed in their 10-K filing. By 2024, this assumption had increased to 4.5%. This upward revision in the assumed rate of compensation growth suggests that Chevron anticipated higher future earnings increases for employees covered under the U.S. pension plan, which, in turn, would lead to greater pension liabilities over the long term. This aligns with the observed increase in projected U.S. pension benefits, which rose from $826 million in 2022 to $1,025 million in 2024, indicating an expectation of growing long-term pension obligations.",

      "answer": "The continued inclusion of real estate activities in CVX's 'All Other' segment in 2024, despite a $329M loss in 2023, suggests that the company maintains a strategic tolerance for non-core asset involvement, likely viewing these activities as part of broader corporate functions such as cash management and long-term investment. In 2023, the 'All Other' segment reported a loss of $329M, indicating underperformance, yet in 2024, real estate activities remained embedded within the same segment, signaling a deliberate decision to retain exposure to these operations. This implies that CVX may be pursuing a long-term or diversified strategy with respect to its real estate holdings, even at the cost of short-term financial performance.",

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

The reserve replacement ratio in 2024 was negative 4 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were 72 percent and 88 percent, respectively. Refer to Table V for a tabulation of the company's proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2022 and each year-end from 2022 through 2024, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2024.\n\nRefer to the 'Results of Operations' section on pages 43 for additional discussion of the company's upstream business.\n\nDownstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and  regional  supply-and-demand  balance  for  refined  products  and  petrochemicals,  and  by  changes  in  the  price  of  crude  oil,  other  refinery  and  petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\n\nOther factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company's shipping operations, which are driven by the industry's demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company's control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe company's most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. The company is also one of the largest renewable fuels producers in the United States.\n\nRefer to the 'Results of Operations' section on page 44 for additional discussion of the company's downstream operations.\n\nAll Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "answer": "The 2021 addition of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen to Kearl's proved reserves, driven by an improved SEC price basis, increased the total proved reserves attributable to XOM through its ownership in Imperial Oil Limited and ExxonMobil Canada Properties. In 2023, XOM used proved reserves as the basis for calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates for upstream assets. Since depreciation is calculated by applying the ratio of asset cost to total proved reserves, the increase in reserves from Kearl likely resulted in lower depreciation rates for those assets. However, the documents do not explicitly quantify this effect for Kearl specifically in 2023, so the precise magnitude of the impact cannot be determined from the provided evidence.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron reported a 1.8 TCF increase in natural gas reserves in Asia, driven in part by strong performance at the Jalalabad Field in Bangladesh. This significant reserve addition likely improved Chevron\u2019s reserve replacement ratio in that year, as the company was able to grow its reserves base through field performance. By 2024, Chevron maintained its stake in the Jalalabad Field, but the 10-K noted that recent political unrest in Bangladesh introduced uncertainty around future operations, even though no operational impact had been observed 'to date.' Despite this risk, Chevron continued to factor the Jalalabad Field into its production strategy, with the field contributing to the company\u2019s broader international production portfolio. The 2024 production outlook reflects an expectation of growth, although the potential for political instability in Bangladesh remains a key risk to future reserve additions and production stability.",

Recent political unrest in the country has not impacted the company's operations to date; however, the future impacts, if any, on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nCommodity Prices The following chart shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $81 per barrel for the full-year 2024, compared to $83 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Brent price was $75 per barrel. The WTI price  averaged  $76  per  barrel  for  the  full-year  2024,  compared  to  $78  in  2023. As  of  mid-February  2025,  the  WTI  price  was  $71  per  barrel.  The  majority  of  the company's equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price averaged $2.25 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the full-year 2024, compared to $2.56 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Henry Hub price was $4.42 per MCF. See page 47 for the company's U.S. and international average realizations for each of the past three years.\n\nCrude prices in 2024 were influenced by geopolitical conflict and OPEC+ supply restraint, which was offset by factors such as non-OPEC supply growth and slowing demand growth.\n\nIn  contrast  to  price  movements  in  the  global  market  for  crude  oil,  prices  for  natural  gas  are  also  impacted  by  regional  supply  and  demand  and  infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, lower Henry Hub prices were driven by high storage levels, strong production, and delayed starts to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects.\n\nOutside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company's long-term contract prices for LNG  are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG  offtake from the operated Australian LNG  projects is committed under binding longterm contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market.\n\nProduction The company's worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2024 was 3.3 million barrels per day, 7 percent higher than in 2023 primarily due to the full-year of legacy PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) production and growth in the Permian Basin. About 20 percent of the company's net oil-equivalent production in 2024 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the Republic of Congo.\n\nThe company estimates its net oil-equivalent production in 2025 to increase six to eight percent over 2024, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $70 per barrel and excluding expected asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greaterthan-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; acquisition and divestment of assets; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and  natural  gas  in  various  markets;  weather  conditions  that  may  shut  in  production;  civil  unrest;  changing  geopolitics;  delays  in  completion  of  maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations.

      "answer": "ExxonMobil\u2019s ROCE declined from 24.9% in 2022 to 15.0% in 2023, coinciding with an increase in Average Capital Employed from $228.4 billion to $243.4 billion. This drop in ROCE indicates that the additional capital deployed during 2023 did not generate proportional returns, suggesting a decrease in capital productivity. The ROCE metric depends on both earnings and capital base, and while earnings excluding financing costs remained relatively strong at $36.6 billion in 2023, the larger capital base diluted the return percentage. This reflects a strategic shift or investment cycle where capital was allocated but had not yet translated into proportionally higher returns within the same year.",

This shift indicates a more strategic and deliberate use of divestments as a tool to reshape the upstream portfolio, rather than treating them as a general offsetting factor.

      "answer": "COP's Lower 48 segment experienced a $431 million increase in production and operating expenses in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by higher transportation costs, acquisition-related expenses, and lease operating expenses. This led to a decline in segment earnings from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024, despite higher production volumes. The acquisition of Marathon Oil added $13.2 billion in provisional fair value of proved oil and gas properties and $10.8 billion for unproved properties, which were evaluated using a discounted cash flow model sensitive to operating cost assumptions. The higher operating costs directly impacted the fair value calculations by reducing projected net cash flows from the acquired assets, increasing scrutiny on management's reserve estimates and discount rate assumptions during the audit process.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

By 2024, however, the company acknowledged that prolonged periods of low oil prices could negatively impact proved reserves, including those from projects like Kearl. This indicates that while the 2021 reserve additions were price-sensitive and benefited from higher SEC benchmarks, XOM\u2019s exposure to oil price volatility increased by 2024, as lower prices could now threaten the economic viability and classification of those reserves.

          "chunk_text": "In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from  year  to  year  due  to  the  timing  of  individual  project  start-ups;  operational  outages;  reservoir  performance;  regulatory  changes;  the  impact  of  fiscal  and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; international trade patterns and relations; and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nThe estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of reservoir and well performance. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in E stablishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2024\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2024 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn  some  circumstances,  where  appropriate  analog  reservoirs  were  available,  reservoir  parameters  from  these  analogs  were  used  to  increase  the  quality  of  and confidence in the reserves estimates.\n\n## C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves\n\nExxonMobil  has  a  dedicated  G lobal  Reserves  and  Resources  group  that  provides  technical  oversight  and  is  separate  from  the  operating  organization.  Primary responsibilities  of  this  group  include  oversight  of  the  reserves  estimation  process  for  compliance  with  Securities  and  Ex change  Commission  (SEC)  rules  and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of ExxonMobil's proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil's proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The current G lobal Reserves and Resources Manager has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in Engineering, and serves on the Oil and G as Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold degrees in either Engineering or Geology.\n\nThe  Global  Reserves  and  Resources  group  maintains  a  central  database  containing  the  official  company  reserves  estimates.  Appropriate  controls,  including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system's controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long-standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and Resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement.",

      "answer": "COP's 2022 Lower 48 asset write-downs reflected declining fair values of noncore assets, signaling a strategic need to strengthen production capacity. By 2024, the Lower 48 segment contributed significantly to production, with total average production increasing by 85 MBOED compared to 2023. This growth was primarily driven by new wells in key basins and the acquisition of Marathon Oil, which added approximately 334 MBOED in production in December 2024 alone. The acquisition directly responded to earlier asset devaluations by expanding COP's core asset base and boosting production despite divestitures of noncore assets. This trajectory demonstrates how COP strategically reallocated capital to high-performing assets post-write-down, resulting in a 7.8% increase in total proved reserves in the Lower 48 segment from 2022 (3,048 million barrels) to 2024 (3,838 million barrels).",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron reported net income attributable to noncontrolling interests at $64 million, which directly reduced the numerator in the interest coverage ratio calculation. The 2024 filing clarifies that the interest coverage ratio is calculated as (income before tax + interest and debt expense + amortization of capitalized interest - net income attributable to noncontrolling interests) \u00f7 before-tax interest costs. While the exact 2024 figure for noncontrolling interests isn't provided, the consistent methodology shows that any increase in this metric would reduce the numerator, potentially lowering the ratio. This mathematical relationship suggests that rising noncontrolling interests could constrain Chevron's debt servicing capacity over time if other components remain constant.",

By 2024, this sensitivity was evident as natural gas prices initially declined toward the middle of the 10-year range due to oversupply and weak demand, before rebounding in Q4 due to colder weather.

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Recent Business Environment\n\nDuring 2024, the price of crude oil remained near the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range (2010-2019), as markets remained balanced. Through the first nine months of the year, natural gas prices declined towards the middle of the 10-year range due to strong supply and lower demand. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices increased on rising demand driven by colder weather in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nRefining margins declined in 2024 from high 2023 levels as increased supply from industry capacity additions outpaced record global demand and remain near the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins improved slightly in 2024 but remained well below the 10-year range driven by over-supply, primarily in Asia.\n\nThe general rate of inflation across major countries peaked in 2022, rising from already elevated levels in 2021, due to additional impacts on energy and other commodities from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Inflation has trended down since 2023 as a result of aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks and slowing  global  economic  growth.  However,  there  has  been  significant  variation  on  the  pace  of  change  across  OECD  and  non-OECD  countries.  With  inflation gradually approaching the official targets in the  U.S. and  Eurozone, the  Federal  Reserve and the  European  Central  Bank began lowering interest rates in 2024. Meanwhile, China has been under persistent deflationary pressure since 2023.\n\nThe Corporation closely monitors market trends and works to mitigate both operating and capital cost impacts in all price environments. Organizational changes implemented over the past several years enabled the Corporation to capture $12.1 billion of structural cost savings versus 2019, including $2.4 billion of savings during 2024, through increased operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-saving measures. The Company sees additional opportunities in areas such as supply chain efficiency, improved maintenance and turnarounds, modernized data management, centralization of activities, and simplified business processes. These savings are key drivers to further reduce our structural costs by $6 billion by 2030, thereby improving the earnings power of the Corporation. ( 1 )\n\nRefer to Frequently Used Terms for definition of structural cost savings. (1)\n\n## Transportation of Kazakhstan Production\n\nThe Corporation holds a 25 percent interest in Tengizchevroil, LLP (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan, and a 16.8 percent working interest in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Oil production from those operations is exported primarily through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which the Corporation holds a 7.5 percent interest. CPC traverses parts of Kazakhstan and Russia to tanker-loading facilities on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. In the event geopolitical issues escalate in the region, including ongoing military conflict, it is possible that the transportation of Kazakhstan oil through the CPC pipeline could be disrupted, curtailed, temporarily suspended, or otherwise restricted. In such a case, the Corporation could experience a loss of cash flows of uncertain duration from its operations in Kazakhstan. For reference, after-tax  earnings related to the Corporation's interests in Kazakhstan in 2024 were approx imately $1.9 billion, and its share of combined oil and gas production was approximately 260 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day.",

      "answer": "The decline in XOM's crude oil realization from $87.25 per barrel in 2022 to $69.85 per barrel in 2023 suggests a reduced netback for the company on each barrel sold, potentially due to factors such as transportation constraints, regional price differentials, or contractual terms. This downward trend in realization implies that even if market crude oil prices remained stable in 2024\u2014'near the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range'\u2014XOM's actual revenue per barrel may have remained under pressure.

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Recent Business Environment\n\nDuring 2024, the price of crude oil remained near the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range (2010-2019), as markets remained balanced. Through the first nine months of the year, natural gas prices declined towards the middle of the 10-year range due to strong supply and lower demand. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices increased on rising demand driven by colder weather in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nRefining margins declined in 2024 from high 2023 levels as increased supply from industry capacity additions outpaced record global demand and remain near the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins improved slightly in 2024 but remained well below the 10-year range driven by over-supply, primarily in Asia.\n\nThe general rate of inflation across major countries peaked in 2022, rising from already elevated levels in 2021, due to additional impacts on energy and other commodities from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Inflation has trended down since 2023 as a result of aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks and slowing  global  economic  growth.  However,  there  has  been  significant  variation  on  the  pace  of  change  across  OECD  and  non-OECD  countries.  With  inflation gradually approaching the official targets in the  U.S. and  Eurozone, the  Federal  Reserve and the  European  Central  Bank began lowering interest rates in 2024. Meanwhile, China has been under persistent deflationary pressure since 2023.\n\nThe Corporation closely monitors market trends and works to mitigate both operating and capital cost impacts in all price environments. Organizational changes implemented over the past several years enabled the Corporation to capture $12.1 billion of structural cost savings versus 2019, including $2.4 billion of savings during 2024, through increased operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-saving measures. The Company sees additional opportunities in areas such as supply chain efficiency, improved maintenance and turnarounds, modernized data management, centralization of activities, and simplified business processes. These savings are key drivers to further reduce our structural costs by $6 billion by 2030, thereby improving the earnings power of the Corporation. ( 1 )\n\nRefer to Frequently Used Terms for definition of structural cost savings. (1)\n\n## Transportation of Kazakhstan Production\n\nThe Corporation holds a 25 percent interest in Tengizchevroil, LLP (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan, and a 16.8 percent working interest in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Oil production from those operations is exported primarily through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which the Corporation holds a 7.5 percent interest. CPC traverses parts of Kazakhstan and Russia to tanker-loading facilities on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. In the event geopolitical issues escalate in the region, including ongoing military conflict, it is possible that the transportation of Kazakhstan oil through the CPC pipeline could be disrupted, curtailed, temporarily suspended, or otherwise restricted. In such a case, the Corporation could experience a loss of cash flows of uncertain duration from its operations in Kazakhstan. For reference, after-tax  earnings related to the Corporation's interests in Kazakhstan in 2024 were approx imately $1.9 billion, and its share of combined oil and gas production was approximately 260 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day.",

By 2023, the Alaska segment contributed only 15% to consolidated liquids production, down from a higher but unspecified 2022 level. This decline was partly due to the Bear-1 well being a dry hole, which increased exploration expenses by $31 million, and a 5 MBOED average production decrease year-over-year due to normal field decline. However, new wells in the Western North Slope and Greater Kuparuk Area partially offset the decline.

There was no appraisal activity in 2021. In August 2021, an Alaska federal judge vacated the U.S. government's approval granted to our planned Willow project previously approved by the BLM in October 2020.  The Department of Justice did not appeal the decision and neither did we.  We are actively supporting the BLM and Department of Interior as they conduct the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement process to address issues highlighted by the federal district court.  In the interim, we are continuing with FEED work in service of a final investment decision.\n\nThe Stony Hill 1 well located to the east of the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit within the NPR-A was plugged and abandoned in 2021 and expensed as a dry hole.\n\nA 3D seismic survey covering 234 square miles was completed in 2020 on state and federal lands.  We are currently evaluating this seismic data for future exploration opportunities.\n\nIn late 2021, the Coyote Brookian topset exploration prospect in the Kuparuk River Unit was tested with a near vertical sidetrack from an existing wellbore.  The well was fracture stimulated and will undergo well testing early in 2022 to confirm longer term deliverability.\n\n## Transportation\n\nWe transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of Trans  -Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).  We have a 29.5 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in and operate the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.\n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double -hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels, as necessary.  The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S.\n\n## Lower 48\n\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the Gulf of Mexico.  The segment is organized into the Permian and Gulf Coast and Rockies business units with a portfolio of low cost of supply, short cycle time, resource-rich unconventional plays, and conventional production from legacy assets. Based on 2021 production volumes, the Lower 48 is the company's largest segment and contributed 55 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 64 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\nIn 2021, we completed two acquisitions significantly increasing our Permian position in the Lower 48.  On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho adding complementary acreage across the Delaware and Midland basins.  On December 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Shell's Delaware Basin position adding significant Texas acreage in the Delaware Basin.  The accounting close date used for reporting purposes of the Shell transaction was December 31, 2021.  For additional information related to these acquisitions, see Note 3 .",

      "answer": "COP's 2024 acquisition of Marathon Oil significantly influenced both the Lower 48 segment earnings and liquids production. The acquisition contributed to a production increase of 85 MBOED in 2024 compared to 2023, with Marathon Oil assets adding approximately 334 MBOED in December alone. However, segment earnings declined from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024. This decrease was partly driven by higher DD&A expenses of $562 million, with $139 million directly linked to the Marathon acquisition. While the acquisition boosted production volumes by adding new wells in key basins like the Delaware and Midland, these gains were partially offset by 'normal field decline' and higher operating costs. The acquisition thus supported production growth but placed downward pressure on segment earnings, revealing a strategic trade-off between volume expansion and short-term profitability.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "answer": "Chevron's 2023 disclosure showed $886M in U.S. pension obligations for 2024, which preceded the $56M settlement loss recognized in 2024's net periodic benefit cost. In 2023's financials, the net periodic benefit cost was $104M with no settlement losses recorded, while in 2024, the net periodic benefit cost became a $492M expense that included the $56M settlement loss. This indicates that the previously disclosed pension obligations materialized in 2024, with specific settlement activity contributing to the increased cost. The emergence of settlement losses in 2024, absent in 2023, directly impacted the net periodic benefit cost calculation for that year.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "answer": "In 2022, XOM's liquids production decreased by 60 thousand barrels per day, with entitlements being a key contributing factor alongside decline and divestments. By 2024, entitlements remained a negative influence on production, but were outweighed by strong growth in regions like the Permian and Guyana, which contributed to a net production increase of 595 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day. This indicates that while entitlements continued to constrain production, XOM's upstream portfolio improvements helped offset their impact, reflecting a transformation in the company\u2019s production dynamics.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil explicitly guided on volume growth as a strategic lever to drive future earnings (Chunk 1). This guidance materialized in 2023, where volume growth directly contributed a $27 million increase in adjusted earnings, stemming from growth in businesses across regions such as the Gulf, Europe, and Turkey (Chunk 2). This contribution was part of the broader context in which ExxonMobil reported $38.572 billion in adjusted earnings for 2023 (Chunk 3), indicating that while volume growth had a measurable positive impact, it represented a relatively small portion of the overall earnings change compared to other drivers like market factors and foreign currency effects.",

Actual future results, including future energy demand and mix; financial and operating performance; realized price and margins; dividends and shareholder  returns,  including  the  timing  and  amounts  of  share  repurchases;  volume  growth;  project  plans,  timing,  costs,  and capacities;  capital  expenditures,  including  lower-emissions  and  environmental  expenditures;  cost  reductions  and  structural  cost savings; integration benefits; emission intensity and absolute emissions reductions; achievement of ambitions to reach Scope 1 and Scope 2 net-zero from operated assets by 2050, to reduce methane emissions and flaring, or to complete major asset emission reduction  roadmaps;  implementation  and  outcomes  of  carbon  capture  and  storage  projects  and  infrastructure,  renewable  fuel projects,  blue  hydrogen  projects,  and  other  technology  efforts;  the  impact  of  new  technologies  on  society  and  industry;  capital expenditures  and  mix;  investment  returns;  accounting  and  financial  reporting  effects  resulting  from  market  or  regulatory developments and ExxonMobil's responsive actions, including potential impairment charges; and the outcome of litigation and tax contingencies,  could  differ  materially  due  to  a  number  of  factors.  These  include  global  or  regional  changes  in  the  supply  and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market or economic conditions that impact demand, prices and differentials; policy and consumer support for lower-emission products and technologies in different jurisdictions; the impact of company actions to protect the health and safety of employees, vendors, customers, and communities; actions of competitors and commercial counterparties; the ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; the severity, length and ultimate impact of COVID-19 variants and government responses on people and economies; reservoir performance; the outcome  of  exploration  projects  and  timely  completion  of  development  and  construction  projects;  regulatory  actions  targeting public companies in the oil and gas industry; changes in local, national, or international law, taxes, regulation or policies affecting our business, including environmental regulations and timely granting of governmental permits; war, trade agreements and patterns, shipping blockades or harassment, and other political or security disturbances; the pace of regional and global economic recovery from  the  pandemic  and  the  occurrence  and  severity  of  future  outbreaks;  opportunities  for  and  regulatory  approval  of  potential investments or divestments; the actions of competitors; the capture of efficiencies within and between business lines and the ability to  maintain  near-term  cost  reductions  as  ongoing  efficiencies  while  maintaining  future  competitive  positioning;  unforeseen technical or operating difficulties; the development and competitiveness of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies; the results of research programs; the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis; general economic conditions including the occurrence and duration of economic recessions; and other factors discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nEnergy demand models are forward-looking by nature and aim to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply ExxonMobil views  any  particular  scenario  as  likely  to  occur.  In  addition,  energy  demand  scenarios  require  assumptions  on  a  variety  of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For  example,  the  IEA  describes  its  NZE  scenario  as  extremely  challenging,  requiring  unprecedented  innovation,  unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use by ExxonMobil is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of  ExxonMobil's  separate  planning  process,  but  may  be  secondarily  tested  for  robustness  or  resiliency  against  different assumptions, including against various scenarios. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for,  and  production  of,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  manufacture,  trade,  transport  and  sale  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. ExxonMobil's operating segments are Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical. Where  applicable  ExxonMobil  voluntarily  discloses  additional  U.S.,  Non-U.S.  and  regional  splits  to  help  investors  better understand the company's operations.\n\nIn  January 2022, the Corporation announced that effective April 2022 it is streamlining its business structure by combining the Chemical and Downstream businesses. The company will be organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions will consist of Energy Products, Specialty Products and Chemical Products. Low Carbon Solutions will continue to be included in Corporate and Financing. The businesses will  be  supported  by  a  combined  technology  organization,  and  other  centralized  service-delivery  groups,  building  on  the establishment of a worldwide major projects organization in 2019.",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP reported upward revisions of 161 million barrels in the Lower 48 due to development drilling in unconventional plays, which contributed to a strong base of reserves. By 2024, this translated into a geographic shift in transfers to proved developed reserves, with approximately 75% of these transfers being driven by the ongoing development of the Lower 48 unconventional plays. This demonstrates a direct progression from reserve additions in unconventional plays to the development phase, with a clear concentration in the Lower 48 region. The volume of these transfers reflects the prioritization of these assets in COP\u2019s development strategy, as highlighted in both the 2023 reserve revisions and the 2024 development disclosures.",

      "answer": "In 2022, COP's natural gas production in the Wind River Basin was valued using an average natural gas production input of 22.9 MMCFD and a natural gas price outlook of $5.68/MMBTU. By 2023, COP's Alaska segment reported only 2% of consolidated natural gas production, which was positively impacted by new wells in the Western North Slope and Greater Kuparuk Area, partially offsetting overall production declines. However, the segment's earnings dropped from $2,352 million in 2022 to $1,778 million in 2023, partly due to lower realized crude oil prices and higher operating costs. The earlier valuation assumptions for natural gas production in 2022 did not fully offset the negative financial impact of oil price volatility and rising expenses in 2023.",

By 2024, the acquisition of Marathon Oil added assets to the Lower 48 segment and directly contributed to a $1,058 million increase in production and operating expenses, including $110 million in acquisition-related costs.

Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024.

The ROSE ratio measures earnings as a percentage of shareholder investments, indicating that Chevron's profitability in 2023 was directly influenced by the equity base established in the prior year.

      "question": "How did the contingent payments in COP's Lower 48 segment evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does the shift in focus toward asset valuation in 2024 indicate about the company's strategic priorities in that segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, COP reported contingent payments of $369 million relating to prior dispositions, with the Lower 48 segment receiving payments calculated monthly at $7 million per month when the U.S. Henry Hub price was at or above $3.20 per MMBTU, continuing through 2023. These payments were a significant contributor to gains on disposition and reflected the company's ongoing monetization of past asset sales. By 2024, the focus in the Lower 48 segment had shifted from contingent payments to asset valuation and acquisition, as evidenced by the $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion provisional fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired from Marathon Oil. This evolution indicates a strategic pivot from deriving post-sale benefits through contingent payments to expanding the segment through major acquisitions, signaling a renewed emphasis on growth and reserve building in the Lower 48.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 Contingent Payments: COP disclosed $369 million in contingent payments tied to prior dispositions, including a structured $7 million monthly payment in the Lower 48 segment when U.S. Henry Hub prices exceeded $3.20 per MMBTU, continuing through 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Contingent Payments \u2192 Lower 48 Segment: The Lower 48 segment was directly tied to contingent payments from asset dispositions, which were recorded as gains on disposition and contributed to the company\u2019s earnings in 2022.",
        "Hop 3: Lower 48 Segment \u2190 COP(2024): In 2024, COP's Lower 48 segment was central to the valuation of $13.2 billion in proved and $10.8 billion in unproved oil and gas properties acquired from Marathon Oil, indicating a strategic shift toward asset expansion rather than monetization."

          "chunk_text": "The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is presented for illustration purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the transactions been completed on January 1, 2020, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results of the combined entity.  The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2020 is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of ConocoPhillips with the results of Concho and the assets acquired from Shell.  The pro forma results do not include transaction-related costs, nor any cost savings anticipated as a result of the transactions.  The pro forma results include adjustments from Concho's historical results to reverse impairment expense of $ 10.5 billion and $1.9 billion related to oil and gas properties and goodwill, respectively. Other adjustments made relate primarily to DD&amp;A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to properties, plants and equipment.  We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are  properly reflected.\n\n## Announced Acquisitions\n\nIn December 2021, we announced that we have notified Origin Energy that we are exercising our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG from Origin Energy for $ 1.645 billion, which will be funded from cash on the balance sheet, before customary adjustments.  The effective date of the transaction will be July 1, 2020 with closing anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2022 subject to Australian government approval.   See Note 4 and Note 7 .\n\n## Assets Sold\n\nIn 2020, we completed the sale of our Australia -West asset and operations.  The sales agreement entitled us to a $200 million payment upon a final investment decision (FID) of the Barossa development project.  On March 30, 2021, FID was announced and as such, we recognized a $200 million gain on disposition in the first quarter of 2021. The purchaser failed to pay the FID bonus when due.  We have commenced an arbitration proceeding against the purchaser to enforce our contractual right to the $ 200 million, plus interest accruing from the due date.  Results of operations related to this transaction are reflected in our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 11 .\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for approximately $250 million after customary adjustments, recognizing a before-tax gain on sale of approximately $58 million.  We also completed the sale of our noncore exploration interests in Argentina, recognizing a beforetax loss on disposition of $179 million.  Results of operations for Argentina were reported in our Other International segment.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded contingent payments of $ 369 million relating to previous dispositions.  The contingent payments are recorded as gain on disposition on our consolidated income statement and are reflected within our Canada and Lower 48 segments.  In our Canada segment, the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel .  The term for contingent payments in our Canada segment ends on May 16, 2022.  In our Lower 48 segment, the contingent payment, paid on an annual basis, is calculated monthly at $7 million per month in which the U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per MMBTU .  The term for contingent payments in our Lower 48 segment goes through 2023. No contingent payments were recorded in 2020.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell two subsidiaries holding our Indonesia assets and operations to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion, before customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2021.  The subsidiaries hold our 54 percent interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a35 percent shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company.  The net carrying value is approximately $0.4 billion, which consists primarily of PP&amp;E.  The assets met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter,  and as of December 31, 2021, we have reclassified $ 0.3 billion of PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and $ 0.1 billion of noncurrent ARO to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet.  The before-tax earnings associated with our Indonesia subsidiaries were $ 604 million, $394 million and $512 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively .  This transaction is expected to close in early 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other specific conditions precedent.  Results of operations for the subsidiaries to be sold are reported within our Asia Pacific segment.",

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

At times, our PP&amp;E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.  As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.  For more information on our impairments, see Note 6 and Note 7 .\n- Effective tax rate .  Our operations are in countries  with different tax rates  and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly  between periods based on the 'mix' of before-tax earnings within our global operations.\n- Fiscal and regulatory environment .  Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments.  These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.  Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Production and Capital\n\n2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion.  The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and $0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.\n\nProduction guidance is 1.8 MMBOED in 2022 including Libya but excluding the impacts from the pending Indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional APLNG shareholding interest.  First quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 MMBOED to 1.79 MMBOED.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\n\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\n\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow,  reflect results from our operations,  including commodity prices and production.",

Those that are initially classified as Level 3 are subsequently reported as Level 2 when the fair value derived from unobservable inputs is inconsequential to the overall fair value, or if corroborated market data becomes available. Assets and liabilities initially reported as Level 2 are subsequently reported as Level 3 if corroborated market data is no longer available. There were no material transfers into or out of Level 3 during 2024 or 2023.\n\n## Recurring Fair Value Measurement\n\nFinancial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis include our investments in debt securities classified as available for sale, commodity derivatives, and our contingent consideration arrangement related to the Surmont acquisition. See Note 3 .\n\n- Level 1 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent exchange-traded futures and options that are valued using unadjusted prices available from the underlying exchange. Level 1 financial assets also include our investments in U.S. government obligations classified as available for sale debt securities, which are valued using exchange prices.\n- Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities primarily represent OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts that are valued using adjusted exchange prices, prices provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are all corroborated by market data. Level 2 financial assets also include our i nvestments in debt securities classified as available for sale including investments in corporate bonds, commercial paper, asset-backed securities, U.S. government agency obligations and foreign government obligations that are valued using pricing provided by brokers or pricing service companies that are corroborated with market data.\n- Level 3 derivative assets and liabilities consist of OTC swaps, options and forward purchase and sale contracts where a significant portion of fair value is calculated from underlying market data that is not readily available. The derived value uses industry standard methodologies that may consider the historical relationships among various commodities, modeled market prices, time value, volatility factors and other relevant economic measures. The use of these inputs results in management's best estimate of fair value. Level 3 commodity derivative activity was not material for all periods presented.\n- Level 3 liabilities include the fair value of future quarterly contingent payments to Total Energies EP Canada Ltd. in connection with the acquisition of the remaining 50 percent working interest in Surmont. Contingent consideration consists of payments up to approximately $0.4 billion CAD over a five-year term ending in the fourth quarter of 2028. The contingent payments represent $2.0 million for every dollar that the monthly WCS average pricing exceeds $52 per barrel. The terms include adjustments related to not achieving certain production targets. The fair value of the contingent consideration as of December 31, 2024 is calculated using the income approach and is largely based on the estimated commodity price outlook using a combination of external pricing service companies' and our internal price outlook (unobservable input) and a discount rate consistent with those used by principal market participants (observable input). Impact of other unobservable inputs on the fair value as of December 31, 2024 was not significant.\n\nThe following table summarizes the fair value hierarchy for gross financial assets and liabilities (i.e., unadjusted where the right of setoff exists for commodity derivatives accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis):\n\n",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP experienced asset write-downs in the Lower 48 segment due to declining fair values of noncore assets, which were evaluated using internal discounted cash flow models incorporating production forecasts and pricing assumptions. By 2024, the Lower 48 segment saw a significant production increase of 85 MBOED compared to 2023, primarily driven by new wells in key basins and the acquisition of Marathon Oil, which added 334 MBOED in December 2024. Despite this production growth, COP announced planned divestitures of noncore Lower 48 assets in early 2025 for approximately $600 million, indicating a strategic reassessment of the segment. This suggests that while production capacity expanded post-write-down, COP is selectively exiting noncore positions in the Lower 48, aligning with a longer-term portfolio optimization strategy.",

By 2024, the Lower 48 segment's production increased by 85 MBOED compared to 2023, primarily driven by new wells and the acquisition of Marathon Oil, which added approximately 334 MBOED in December 2024 alone. This production growth was supported by an increase in total proved reserves in the Lower 48 region from 3,062 million barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2023 to 3,838 million barrels at the end of 2024 \u2014 a net increase of 776 million barrels. Therefore, the Marathon Oil acquisition not only boosted short-term production volumes but also significantly expanded the company's reserve base in the Lower 48, indicating a strategic alignment in strengthening its core onshore U.S. position.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2023) \u2192 Lower 48 Segment: In 2023, COP had to write down the carrying value of noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment due to declining fair values estimated via discounted cash flow models.",
        "Hop 2: Lower 48 Segment \u2192 Production: In 2024, the Lower 48 segment's production increased by 85 MBOED compared to 2023, with Marathon Oil acquisition contributing 334 MBOED in December.",
        "Hop 3: Production \u2190 COP(2024): Total proved reserves in the Lower 48 increased from 3,062 million barrels at the end of 2023 to 3,838 million barrels at the end of 2024, showing a direct link between production growth and reserve expansion."

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico and commercial operations. During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "answer": "In 2023, COP's earnings were negatively impacted by higher production and operating expenses driven by increased well work activities and higher volumes, primarily in the Lower 48 segment. These rising cost trends carried over into 2024, where the Alaska Segment specifically reported a $90 million increase in production and operating expenses, with $56 million attributed to higher well work activity and $26 million to transportation-related costs. This contributed to a decline in Alaska's earnings from $1,778 million in 2023 to $1,326 million in 2024, a decrease of $452 million. Additionally, in 2024, the company continued exploration activities in Alaska, including a before-tax expense of $31 million for the Bear-1 exploration well, further influencing segment-level financials.",

Additional decreases to earnings included higher DD&amp;A expenses of $175 million, driven by higher rates as a result of 2023 year-end downward reserve revisions as well as higher production and operating expenses of $90 million, driven by higher well work activity of $56 million and transportation related costs of $26 million.\n\n## Production\n\nAverage production decreased one MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to normal field decline.\n\nThe production decrease was partly offset by new wells online at our Western North Slope and Greater Kuparuk Area assets.\n\n## Acquisition of Additional Working Interest in Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit\n\nAfter exercising our preferential rights, we completed an acquisition of additional working interest in both the Kuparuk River Unit and the Prudhoe Bay Unit in the fourth quarter of 2024. Production from the additional working interest averaged approximately five MBOED each month for November and December 2024. See Note 3.",

      "question": "How did the 2023 production levels in the Lower 48 segment influence the financial and operational performance of COP's Lower 48 operations in 2024, particularly in light of the Marathon Oil acquisition and the associated $13.2 billion provisional fair value of proved oil and gas properties?",
      "answer": "In 2023, COP's Lower 48 segment reported production levels of 1,477 million barrels of crude oil. This production level served as a baseline that directly influenced the segment's performance in 2024, where total average production increased by 85 MBOED compared to 2023, driven by new wells in key basins and the acquisition of Marathon Oil. The Marathon Oil acquisition added $13.2 billion in provisional fair value of proved oil and gas properties to the Lower 48 segment, which significantly expanded the asset base and contributed to higher DD&A expenses ($562 million increase) and production volumes. Despite higher production contributing $1,003 million to earnings, lower commodity prices reduced revenues, and the segment's earnings declined from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024. Thus, the 2023 production levels set the stage for a year of growth in 2024, but also introduced new cost pressures and market risks that impacted profitability.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "In 2022, a 25 basis point change in interest rates was shown to impact COP's U.S. pension expense by $45 million (increase) or $(50) million (decrease), indicating a notable sensitivity of pension costs to interest rate fluctuations. By 2024, COP's disclosures revealed that interest rate risk was primarily tied to debt instruments rather than pension obligations, with a statement that a 10% change in interest rates would not materially affect interest expense on floating-rate debt. This suggests a strategic shift or risk mitigation in how interest rate exposure affects the company\u2014moving from a focus on pension liabilities in 2022 to a more debt-centric view in 2024. The evolution of the U.S. Plans \u2192 Interest Rate Change relationship indicates that COP's exposure to interest rate risk through pension obligations may have decreased or stabilized, allowing the company to focus on broader interest rate sensitivities in 2024.",

By 2023, the MET_10k_2023.pdf reported that volume growth positively impacted adjusted earnings by $56 million, a significant decline from the $130 million positive impact seen in 2022. This indicates a reduced contribution from volume growth to earnings, despite being still positive, suggesting either slower growth rates or increased cost pressures offsetting gains.

These  include  global  or  regional  changes  in  the  supply  and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market or economic conditions that impact demand, prices and differentials; policy and consumer support for lower-emission products and technologies in different jurisdictions; the impact of company actions to protect the health and safety of employees, vendors, customers, and communities; actions of competitors and commercial counterparties; the ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; the severity, length and ultimate impact of COVID-19 variants and government responses on people and economies; reservoir performance; the outcome  of  exploration  projects  and  timely  completion  of  development  and  construction  projects;  regulatory  actions  targeting public companies in the oil and gas industry; changes in local, national, or international law, taxes, regulation or policies affecting our business, including environmental regulations and timely granting of governmental permits; war, trade agreements and patterns, shipping blockades or harassment, and other political or security disturbances; the pace of regional and global economic recovery from  the  pandemic  and  the  occurrence  and  severity  of  future  outbreaks;  opportunities  for  and  regulatory  approval  of  potential investments or divestments; the actions of competitors; the capture of efficiencies within and between business lines and the ability to  maintain  near-term  cost  reductions  as  ongoing  efficiencies  while  maintaining  future  competitive  positioning;  unforeseen technical or operating difficulties; the development and competitiveness of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies; the results of research programs; the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis; general economic conditions including the occurrence and duration of economic recessions; and other factors discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nEnergy demand models are forward-looking by nature and aim to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply ExxonMobil views  any  particular  scenario  as  likely  to  occur.  In  addition,  energy  demand  scenarios  require  assumptions  on  a  variety  of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For  example,  the  IEA  describes  its  NZE  scenario  as  extremely  challenging,  requiring  unprecedented  innovation,  unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use by ExxonMobil is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of  ExxonMobil's  separate  planning  process,  but  may  be  secondarily  tested  for  robustness  or  resiliency  against  different assumptions, including against various scenarios. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for,  and  production  of,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  manufacture,  trade,  transport  and  sale  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. ExxonMobil's operating segments are Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical. Where  applicable  ExxonMobil  voluntarily  discloses  additional  U.S.,  Non-U.S.  and  regional  splits  to  help  investors  better understand the company's operations.\n\nIn  January 2022, the Corporation announced that effective April 2022 it is streamlining its business structure by combining the Chemical and Downstream businesses. The company will be organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions will consist of Energy Products, Specialty Products and Chemical Products. Low Carbon Solutions will continue to be included in Corporate and Financing. The businesses will  be  supported  by  a  combined  technology  organization,  and  other  centralized  service-delivery  groups,  building  on  the establishment of a worldwide major projects organization in 2019.",

      "answer": "In 2022, DD&A expenses were noted as a negative impact on COP's earnings due to higher production volumes, though partially offset by lower rates from price-related reserve revisions. By 2024, DD&A expenses in the Alaska segment had increased by $175 million, driven by higher rates from 2023 year-end downward reserve revisions and increased production. Despite this, the Alaska segment still contributed to COP\u2019s earnings, with production benefiting from the 2024 acquisition of additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit, which added approximately five MBOED in monthly production for November and December. This acquisition helped offset some of the negative impacts of higher DD&A and production costs, though earnings in Alaska still declined year-over-year from $1,778 million in 2023 to $1,326 million in 2024 due to lower commodity prices and timing of sales.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil's natural gas production was reported at 8.5 billion cubic feet per day, with divestments cited as a partial offset to production growth. By 2024, divestments had a more pronounced negative impact, directly contributing to a $560 million decrease in earnings due to lower base volumes. This indicates that divestments increased in significance from 2022 to 2024, not only affecting production volumes but also directly impacting financial performance. The evolution of the relationship shows a strategic shift where divestments moved from being a moderating factor in production growth to a key driver of earnings decline.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

The reserve replacement ratio in 2024 was negative 4 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were 72 percent and 88 percent, respectively. Refer to Table V for a tabulation of the company's proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2022 and each year-end from 2022 through 2024, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2024.\n\nRefer to the 'Results of Operations' section on pages 43 for additional discussion of the company's upstream business.\n\nDownstream Earnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and  regional  supply-and-demand  balance  for  refined  products  and  petrochemicals,  and  by  changes  in  the  price  of  crude  oil,  other  refinery  and  petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\n\nOther factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company's shipping operations, which are driven by the industry's demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company's control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe company's most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. The company is also one of the largest renewable fuels producers in the United States.\n\nRefer to the 'Results of Operations' section on page 44 for additional discussion of the company's downstream operations.\n\nAll Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "question": "How did the discontinuation of the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia in 2022 impact ConocoPhillips' exploration expenses in 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's evolving exploration strategy?",
      "answer": "The discontinuation of the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia in 2022, which led to a $50 million before-tax expense for dry hole costs and impairment of associated capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs, contributed to a broader reduction in exploration expenses by 2024. By 2024, ConocoPhillips' total exploration expenses across all consolidated operations had decreased to $356 million, with only $40 million attributed to the Asia Pacific/Middle East segment\u2014where the Kamunsu East Field was previously categorized. This reflects a strategic shift toward focusing on more promising assets and reducing spending on non-core or underperforming fields.",

        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 Kamunsu East Field: In 2022, COP recorded a $50 million before-tax expense related to dry hole costs and impairment for Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which was removed from development plans.",
        "Hop 2: Kamunsu East Field \u2192 Exploration Expenses: The discontinuation of Kamunsu East Field contributed to the overall reduction in exploration expenses, as noted in COP's 2021 earnings analysis, which cited the absence of such impairments in future years.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips' Liquids Production was significantly supported by the Lower 48 segment, which contributed 55% of consolidated liquids production. This was partly driven by the 2021 acquisitions of Concho and Shell\u2019s Delaware Basin assets, which expanded the company's unconventional resource base. By 2024, the Lower 48 segment's contribution to liquids production increased to 63%, and the segment reported earnings of $5,175 million, although this was lower than the $6,461 million in 2023. The Marathon Oil acquisition in late 2024 added approximately 334 MBOED in December alone, further boosting production volumes but also increasing DD&A by $562 million and operating expenses by $431 million. Thus, while the acquisitions enhanced production capacity and segment scale, they also introduced cost pressures that affected earnings growth in the Lower 48 segment.",

There was no appraisal activity in 2021. In August 2021, an Alaska federal judge vacated the U.S. government's approval granted to our planned Willow project previously approved by the BLM in October 2020.  The Department of Justice did not appeal the decision and neither did we.  We are actively supporting the BLM and Department of Interior as they conduct the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement process to address issues highlighted by the federal district court.  In the interim, we are continuing with FEED work in service of a final investment decision.\n\nThe Stony Hill 1 well located to the east of the Greater Mooses Tooth Unit within the NPR-A was plugged and abandoned in 2021 and expensed as a dry hole.\n\nA 3D seismic survey covering 234 square miles was completed in 2020 on state and federal lands.  We are currently evaluating this seismic data for future exploration opportunities.\n\nIn late 2021, the Coyote Brookian topset exploration prospect in the Kuparuk River Unit was tested with a near vertical sidetrack from an existing wellbore.  The well was fracture stimulated and will undergo well testing early in 2022 to confirm longer term deliverability.\n\n## Transportation\n\nWe transport the petroleum liquids produced on the North Slope to Valdez, Alaska through an 800-mile pipeline that is part of Trans  -Alaska Pipeline System (TAPS).  We have a 29.5 percent ownership interest in TAPS, and we also have ownership interests in and operate the Alpine, Kuparuk and Oliktok pipelines on the North Slope.\n\nOur wholly owned subsidiary, Polar Tankers, Inc., manages the marine transportation of our North Slope production, using five company-owned, double -hulled tankers, and charters third-party vessels, as necessary.  The tankers deliver oil from Valdez, Alaska, primarily to refineries on the west coast of the U.S.\n\n## Lower 48\n\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the 48 contiguous U.S. states and the Gulf of Mexico.  The segment is organized into the Permian and Gulf Coast and Rockies business units with a portfolio of low cost of supply, short cycle time, resource-rich unconventional plays, and conventional production from legacy assets. Based on 2021 production volumes, the Lower 48 is the company's largest segment and contributed 55 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 64 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\nIn 2021, we completed two acquisitions significantly increasing our Permian position in the Lower 48.  On January 15, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Concho adding complementary acreage across the Delaware and Midland basins.  On December 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Shell's Delaware Basin position adding significant Texas acreage in the Delaware Basin.  The accounting close date used for reporting purposes of the Shell transaction was December 31, 2021.  For additional information related to these acquisitions, see Note 3 .",

Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "question": "How did the contingent payments in COP's Canada segment evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's exposure to WCS crude price volatility and its exploration strategy in the region?",
      "answer": "In 2022, COP's Canada segment received contingent payments calculated at $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeded $52 CAD per barrel, with the payment term ending on May 16, 2022. This indicates a direct exposure to WCS crude price volatility during that period. By 2024, the Canada segment was instead marked by exploration-related expenses, including a $129 million before-tax impairment charge in late 2022 for aged, suspended wells at Surmont\u2014a cost directly attributed to exploration activities. This shift from contingent revenue tied to commodity prices to exploration expenditures suggests a strategic pivot toward active development in the region, despite potential risks from crude price fluctuations.",

        "Hop 2: Contingent Payments \u2192 Canada Segment: The contingent payments were directly linked to COP\u2019s Canada segment operations, reflecting the segment\u2019s sensitivity to WCS crude price movements.",

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2020 is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of ConocoPhillips with the results of Concho and the assets acquired from Shell.  The pro forma results do not include transaction-related costs, nor any cost savings anticipated as a result of the transactions.  The pro forma results include adjustments from Concho's historical results to reverse impairment expense of $ 10.5 billion and $1.9 billion related to oil and gas properties and goodwill, respectively. Other adjustments made relate primarily to DD&amp;A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to properties, plants and equipment.  We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are  properly reflected.\n\n## Announced Acquisitions\n\nIn December 2021, we announced that we have notified Origin Energy that we are exercising our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG from Origin Energy for $ 1.645 billion, which will be funded from cash on the balance sheet, before customary adjustments.  The effective date of the transaction will be July 1, 2020 with closing anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2022 subject to Australian government approval.   See Note 4 and Note 7 .\n\n## Assets Sold\n\nIn 2020, we completed the sale of our Australia -West asset and operations.  The sales agreement entitled us to a $200 million payment upon a final investment decision (FID) of the Barossa development project.  On March 30, 2021, FID was announced and as such, we recognized a $200 million gain on disposition in the first quarter of 2021. The purchaser failed to pay the FID bonus when due.  We have commenced an arbitration proceeding against the purchaser to enforce our contractual right to the $ 200 million, plus interest accruing from the due date.  Results of operations related to this transaction are reflected in our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 11 .\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for approximately $250 million after customary adjustments, recognizing a before-tax gain on sale of approximately $58 million.  We also completed the sale of our noncore exploration interests in Argentina, recognizing a beforetax loss on disposition of $179 million.  Results of operations for Argentina were reported in our Other International segment.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded contingent payments of $ 369 million relating to previous dispositions.  The contingent payments are recorded as gain on disposition on our consolidated income statement and are reflected within our Canada and Lower 48 segments.  In our Canada segment, the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel .  The term for contingent payments in our Canada segment ends on May 16, 2022.  In our Lower 48 segment, the contingent payment, paid on an annual basis, is calculated monthly at $7 million per month in which the U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per MMBTU .  The term for contingent payments in our Lower 48 segment goes through 2023. No contingent payments were recorded in 2020.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell two subsidiaries holding our Indonesia assets and operations to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion, before customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2021.  The subsidiaries hold our 54 percent interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a35 percent shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company.  The net carrying value is approximately $0.4 billion, which consists primarily of PP&amp;E.  The assets met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter,  and as of December 31, 2021, we have reclassified $ 0.3 billion of PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and $ 0.1 billion of noncurrent ARO to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet.  The before-tax earnings associated with our Indonesia subsidiaries were $ 604 million, $394 million and $512 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively .  This transaction is expected to close in early 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other specific conditions precedent.  Results of operations for the subsidiaries to be sold are reported within our Asia Pacific segment.",

      "answer": "The 2023 downward reserve revisions in the Alaska segment directly led to higher DD&A expenses in 2024, which increased by $175 million due to higher depreciation rates resulting from those revisions. In 2023, the company recorded a $31 million dry hole cost in Alaska related to the Bear-1 exploration well, which likely contributed to the reserve revisions by reducing the segment's expected recoverable reserves. This reduction in reserves accelerated the depletion of remaining assets, thus increasing the DD&A rate applied in 2024. The temporal relationship shows that exploration outcomes in 2023 (such as the Bear-1 dry hole) influenced reserve estimates, which in turn drove higher depreciation costs in the following year.",

This expense was a one-time impairment and dry hole cost that contributed to the total 2022 exploration expenses of $306 million. By 2023, the discontinuation of this field meant that these specific impairment costs did not recur, contributing to a more favorable exploration expense profile.

We no longer believe the project will advance, and there is no current market for the asset.\n\nIn our Other International segment, our interests in the Middle Magdalena Basin of Colombia are in force majeure. As we had no immediate plans to perform under existing contracts; therefore, in 2020, we recorded a before-tax expense totaling $ 84 million for dry hole costs of a previously suspended well and an impairment of the associated capitalized undeveloped leasehold carrying value.\n\nIn our Asia Pacific segment, we recorded before-tax expense of $ 50 million related to dry hole costs of a previously suspended well and an impairment of the associated capitalized undeveloped leasehold carrying value associated with the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia that is no longer in our development plans.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn our Lower 48 segment, we recorded a before-tax impairment of $ 141 million for the associated carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs and dry hole expenses of $ 111 million before-tax due to our decision to discontinue exploration activities related to our Central Louisiana Austin Chalk acreage.",

See Note 3 .\n- A gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020.\n- Lower exploration expenses due to:\n- o Absence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after  -tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset.\n- o Lower dry hole expenses.\n- o Absence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska.\n- o Absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans.\n- Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices.\n- Contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments.\n- An after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a FID bonus associated with our Australia -West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3 .\n- Lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7 .\n\nThese increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:\n\n- Higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes.\n- Higher DD&amp;A expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021.\n- Absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our Australia-West divestiture completed in May 2020.\n- Restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the Concho and Shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.",

      "question": "How did the consistent application of a 4.5% rate of compensation increase for U.S. Pension Benefits in 2022 and 2023 impact the valuation of CVX's pension obligations, considering the change in discount rates used to determine benefit obligations from 2.8% in 2022 to 5.0% in 2023?",
      "answer": "The consistent use of a 4.5% rate of compensation increase for U.S. Pension Benefits across both 2022 and 2023 meant that changes in pension obligation valuations were primarily driven by shifts in the discount rate assumption. In 2022, CVX used a 2.8% discount rate to determine U.S. Pension Benefit obligations, but this increased significantly to 5.0% in 2023. A higher discount rate reduces the present value of future pension liabilities, which would generally lead to a decrease in reported pension obligations, despite the compensation increase assumption remaining constant. This reflects a strategic shift in how CVX valued its future liabilities, influenced by changing market conditions affecting discount rates, while maintaining consistent assumptions about future salary growth.",

        "Hop 1: CVX(2022) \u2192 Rate of Compensation Increase: CVX used a 4.5% rate of compensation increase for U.S. Pension Benefits in 2022",

        "Hop 3: U.S. Pension Benefits \u2190 CVX(2023): In 2023, CVX applied a significantly higher 5.0% discount rate for U.S. Pension Benefits, while maintaining the same 4.5% compensation increase assumption"

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil's Adjusted Earnings were positively impacted by $89 million due to Volume Growth, driven by growth in accident & health, group disability, and dental businesses. By 2024, the role of Volume Growth evolved significantly, with 'Advantaged Volume Growth' contributing $410 million to earnings, primarily from record high-value product sales. This indicates a transformation in how volume expansion influenced earnings\u2014shifting from general insurance growth to advantaged chemical product volume performance. The connection between Adjusted Earnings and Volume Growth thus evolved from a relatively modest positive impact in 2023 to a much stronger and strategically focused driver in 2024.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs.

Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\n\nIn fourth quarter 2024, the company announced plans to achieve $2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including expanded use of global capability centers. In relation to these efforts, the company recognized a restructuring charge of $715 million after tax in fourth quarter 2024, with associated cash outflows anticipated over the next two years. The company continues to evaluate incremental cost reduction opportunities and could incur additional restructuring and reorganization charges in future periods. This will have an impact on the company's pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB) plans; however, the impact is not yet estimable and any impacts will be recognized in future periods.\n\nEarnings trends for the company's major business areas are described as follows:\n\nUpstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. These prices are subject to external factors over  which  the  company  has  no  control,  including  product  demand  connected  with  global  economic  conditions,  industry  production  and  inventory  levels, technology  advancements,  production  quotas  or  other  actions  imposed  by  OPEC+  countries,  actions  of  regulators,  weather-related  damage  and  disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company's control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company's production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\n\nThe longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company's ability to efficiently find, acquire and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn April 2024, Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) achieved start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and at year-end 2024, all four pressure boost facility compressors are online and all metering stations have been converted to low pressure. In January 2025, TCO started oil production at its Future G rowth Project, which is ex pected to contribute to higher free cash flow.\n\nChevron has interests in V enezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in V enezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received G eneral License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in V enezuela subject to certain limitations, and the company continues such activities under this G eneral License. The financial results for Chevron's business in V enezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company's results. Crude oil liftings in V enezuela started in first quarter 2023, which have positively impacted the company's results. The company's independent affiliates have continued to maintain safe and reliable operations; however, future impact on results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nChevron maintains an equity interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) which provides a primary export route for Tengiz field production in Kazakhstan. An adverse  event  or  incident  affecting  CPC  operations,  which  CPC  has  ex perienced  from  time  to  time,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Tengiz  field  and  the company's results of operations and financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions and the February 2025 drone attack on the CPC pumping station, remain uncertain.\n\nOther governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or ex port crude in the region around Russia.\n\nChevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar field in Israel. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and various regional adversaries, the company continues to maintain safe and reliable operations while meeting its contractual commitments. The company continues to monitor the ongoing conflict in the region and any future impacts on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.",

      "question": "How did the impact of divestments on natural gas production change between 2022 and 2024, and what does this reveal about ExxonMobil's evolving upstream strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, divestments were a key factor contributing to a decrease in natural gas production, as seen in the 2022 10-K filing, where divestments and Groningen production limits only partially offset an increase in natural gas output. Specifically, the 2022 report notes that natural gas production increased by 66 million cubic feet per day in 2021 compared to 2020, but this growth was constrained by divestments. By 2024, the scale and impact of divestments had evolved \u2014 asset sales totaled 0.1 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB), primarily in Nigeria, indicating a more strategic and targeted approach to divestments. These 2024 divestments were smaller in volume but aligned with a broader upstream strategy that emphasized acquisitions (like Pioneer) and reserve additions through extensions and discoveries, particularly in the U.S. and Guyana. This suggests that while divestments continued to play a role in portfolio optimization, they were no longer a primary constraint on production growth, reflecting a shift toward more selective asset management and reinvestment in high-potential regions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM(2022) \u2192 Divestments: In 2022, divestments were a key factor reducing production volumes, as explicitly stated in the 10-K filing.",
        "Hop 2: Divestments \u2192 Natural Gas Production: Divestments were shown to negatively impact natural gas production, as seen in the 2021 production data where growth was partly offset by divestments.",
        "Hop 3: Natural Gas Production \u2190 XOM(2024): In 2024, asset sales totaled 0.1 GOEB, primarily in Nigeria, showing divestments remained a part of the strategy but were more targeted and less disruptive to overall production growth."

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "question": "How did the changes in ExxonMobil's proved reserves estimation process between 2022 and 2023 impact the role and responsibilities of the Global Reserves and Resources Group in certifying reserve figures that directly influence upstream property, plant, and equipment valuations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil's proved reserves estimation process was described as an ongoing activity influenced by technical evaluations, commercial assessments, and reservoir data, with actual production volumes subject to variation due to multiple operational and market factors. By 2023, the company emphasized a more structured and controlled process, with the Global Reserves and Resources Group playing a central role in overseeing compliance with SEC rules, maintaining the central reserves database, and ensuring that all changes to reserves estimates underwent rigorous technical and managerial review. This group's endorsement became a mandatory step in the reserves reporting process. In 2023, the proved reserves figures were directly tied to upstream PP&E valuations, which stood at $148.2 billion as of December 31, 2023, and influenced depreciation and depletion expenses of $16.6 billion for the year. The increased scrutiny and formalization of the reserves estimation process in 2023 elevated the Group\u2019s role in ensuring data integrity and auditability, especially in light of the critical audit matter raised by PwC regarding the estimation of proved developed oil and gas reserves and their impact on asset valuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM(2022) \u2192 Proved Reserves: XOM's proved reserves were subject to variability due to factors like project timing, reservoir performance, regulatory changes, and oil prices, with estimation based on technical and commercial analysis.",
        "Hop 2: Proved Reserves \u2192 Global Reserves and Resources Group: The Group was responsible for technical oversight, SEC compliance, and maintaining the official reserves database, with changes requiring multi-level approvals and technical validation.",
        "Hop 3: Global Reserves and Resources Group \u2190 XOM(2023): In 2023, the Group played a critical role in certifying reserves figures that directly impacted upstream asset valuations, which stood at $148.2 billion, and were subject to audit scrutiny due to the high degree of judgment involved in estimation."

However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil reported a $886 million gain from the sale of assets, including the Romania, U.S. Barnett Shale, and XTO Energy Canada assets, which partially offset a $2,939 million loss in Identified Items driven by the Russia expropriation and European tax impacts. By 2024, the company recorded a relatively small $216 million in Identified Items, indicating a significant reduction in losses from such events. This shift suggests a decline in the frequency or severity of extraordinary events affecting earnings, even as the company continued to engage in asset divestments. However, the evidence does not specify new asset sales in 2024, so the reduced impact on Identified Items may reflect strategic or operational adjustments rather than a direct increase in asset sale gains.",

However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

      "question": "How did ExxonMobil's disclosure of proved undeveloped natural gas reserves in the Other Americas region change between its 2022 and 2024 filings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil reported proved undeveloped natural gas reserves in the Other Americas region as part of a broader geographic breakdown, with a total of 23.1 trillion cubic feet (23,100 billion cubic feet) included under 'Other Americas' in the consolidated subsidiaries section. By 2024, the company refined its disclosure format, specifying that the Other Americas region included 231 billion cubic feet of proved undeveloped natural gas reserves. This represents a more granular and compartmentalized presentation of the same type of reserves, indicating a shift in how the company communicates regional reserve composition to stakeholders.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: XOM(2022) \u2192 Proved Undeveloped Reserves: XOM's 2022 filing included detailed breakdowns of proved undeveloped reserves by region, including 23,100 billion cubic feet of natural gas in the 'Other Americas' category under consolidated subsidiaries.",
        "Hop 2: Proved Undeveloped Reserves \u2192 Natural Gas Reserves: Proved undeveloped reserves inherently include natural gas reserves, as evidenced by the explicit categorization of natural gas volumes within the broader reserve classifications.",
        "Hop 3: Natural Gas Reserves \u2190 XOM(2024): In the 2024 filing, XOM specifically called out 231 billion cubic feet of proved undeveloped natural gas reserves in the Other Americas region, refining the level of detail compared to the broader 2022 presentation."

Summary of Oil and Gas Reserves at Year-E nd 2024\n\nThe table below summarizes the oil-equivalent proved reserves in each geographic area and by product type for consolidated subsidiaries and equity companies. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six billion cubic feet per one million barrels. The Corporation has reported proved reserves on the basis of the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period. No major discovery or other favorable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2024 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date.\n\n",

      "question": "How did COP's decision to impair the Alaska North Slope Gas asset with an $828 million charge in 2022 influence its 2023 exploration expense allocation, particularly the $80 million disclosed for Alaska, and what does this reveal about the company's shifting exploration priorities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, COP recorded an $828 million impairment for the Alaska North Slope Gas asset, reflecting its decision that the project would no longer advance and indicating a strategic shift away from that asset (Hop 1). This impairment directly contributed to a reduction in future exploration expenses, as noted in the 2021 comparison where the absence of this impairment was cited as a key factor in lower exploration expenses (Hop 2). By 2023, COP's Alaska exploration expenses had dropped to $80 million, a significant decrease from prior years, aligning with the discontinuation of costly appraisal and development activities for the Alaska North Slope Gas asset (Hop 3). This trajectory reveals a clear strategic pivot away from high-cost, non-core assets toward more economically viable exploration opportunities.",

      "question": "How did COP's 2022 contingent payments tied to the Lower 48 segment influence asset valuation and impairment decisions compared to 2023 developments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, COP disclosed contingent payments of $369 million related to prior dispositions, with part of this amount tied to the Lower 48 segment based on U.S. Henry Hub prices exceeding $3.20 per MMBTU. These payments were recorded as gains on disposition and reflected positively on the segment\u2019s financial performance. However, in 2023, the company noted that the estimated fair value of certain noncore assets in the Lower 48 segment had declined below carrying values, leading to impairments. This shift indicates that despite the positive contingent payments in 2022, the underlying asset valuations in the Lower 48 segment weakened in 2023, likely due to changing commodity price assumptions, production forecasts, or market conditions, which directly influenced impairment decisions.",

          "chunk_text": "The unaudited supplemental pro forma financial information is presented for illustration purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the operating results that would have occurred had the transactions been completed on January 1, 2020, nor is it necessarily indicative of future operating results of the combined entity.  The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2020 is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of ConocoPhillips with the results of Concho and the assets acquired from Shell.  The pro forma results do not include transaction-related costs, nor any cost savings anticipated as a result of the transactions.  The pro forma results include adjustments from Concho's historical results to reverse impairment expense of $ 10.5 billion and $1.9 billion related to oil and gas properties and goodwill, respectively. Other adjustments made relate primarily to DD&amp;A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to properties, plants and equipment.  We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are  properly reflected.\n\n## Announced Acquisitions\n\nIn December 2021, we announced that we have notified Origin Energy that we are exercising our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG from Origin Energy for $ 1.645 billion, which will be funded from cash on the balance sheet, before customary adjustments.  The effective date of the transaction will be July 1, 2020 with closing anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2022 subject to Australian government approval.   See Note 4 and Note 7 .\n\n## Assets Sold\n\nIn 2020, we completed the sale of our Australia -West asset and operations.  The sales agreement entitled us to a $200 million payment upon a final investment decision (FID) of the Barossa development project.  On March 30, 2021, FID was announced and as such, we recognized a $200 million gain on disposition in the first quarter of 2021. The purchaser failed to pay the FID bonus when due.  We have commenced an arbitration proceeding against the purchaser to enforce our contractual right to the $ 200 million, plus interest accruing from the due date.  Results of operations related to this transaction are reflected in our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 11 .\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for approximately $250 million after customary adjustments, recognizing a before-tax gain on sale of approximately $58 million.  We also completed the sale of our noncore exploration interests in Argentina, recognizing a beforetax loss on disposition of $179 million.  Results of operations for Argentina were reported in our Other International segment.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded contingent payments of $ 369 million relating to previous dispositions.  The contingent payments are recorded as gain on disposition on our consolidated income statement and are reflected within our Canada and Lower 48 segments.  In our Canada segment, the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel .  The term for contingent payments in our Canada segment ends on May 16, 2022.  In our Lower 48 segment, the contingent payment, paid on an annual basis, is calculated monthly at $7 million per month in which the U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per MMBTU .  The term for contingent payments in our Lower 48 segment goes through 2023. No contingent payments were recorded in 2020.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell two subsidiaries holding our Indonesia assets and operations to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion, before customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2021.  The subsidiaries hold our 54 percent interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a35 percent shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company.  The net carrying value is approximately $0.4 billion, which consists primarily of PP&amp;E.  The assets met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter,  and as of December 31, 2021, we have reclassified $ 0.3 billion of PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and $ 0.1 billion of noncurrent ARO to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet.  The before-tax earnings associated with our Indonesia subsidiaries were $ 604 million, $394 million and $512 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively .  This transaction is expected to close in early 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other specific conditions precedent.  Results of operations for the subsidiaries to be sold are reported within our Asia Pacific segment.",

The company earned $56.9 billion (excluding financing costs) in 2022 on $228.4 billion in capital, but only earned $36.6 billion (excluding financing costs) in 2023 on $243.4 billion in capital, indicating reduced capital productivity.",

      "question": "How did ConocoPhillips' relatively flat Alaska natural gas production from 34 million cubic feet daily in 2022 to 38 million cubic feet daily in 2023 relate to their continued exploration investment, including the $31 million Bear-1 dry hole expense in 2023 and ongoing exploration activities in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips reported Alaska natural gas production of 38 million cubic feet daily, showing relatively flat growth compared to 34 million cubic feet daily in 2022. Despite this modest production increase, the company incurred a $31 million before-tax expense for the Bear-1 dry hole in Alaska in 2023. This exploration activity was part of broader efforts that included reaching FID on the Willow project following regulatory approval. In 2024, exploration activities continued, although the Bear-1 well was determined to be a dry hole. This pattern suggests that despite limited production gains and a costly unsuccessful exploration effort in Alaska in 2023, ConocoPhillips maintained its exploration commitment into 2024, indicating a strategic emphasis on long-term resource potential over short-term production outcomes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2023) \u2192 Natural Gas Production: COP reported 38 million cubic feet daily of natural gas production in Alaska for 2023, up slightly from 34 million cubic feet daily in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Natural Gas Production \u2192 Alaska Segment: Natural gas production in Alaska positively impacts the Alaska segment's performance, though production was noted to be declining due to normal field depletion, despite the slight increase in reported figures.",
        "Hop 3: Alaska Segment \u2190 COP(2024): COP's 2024 filing shows continued exploration activities, even after the costly Bear-1 dry hole in Alaska in 2023, indicating sustained investment in the segment despite mixed results."

      "question": "How did the change in ConocoPhillips' Alaska segment earnings between 2022 and 2023 relate to fluctuations in 'Lower Taxes Other Than Income Taxes', and what does this reveal about the segment's sensitivity to crude oil price movements?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Alaska segment reported earnings of $2,352 million, which dropped to $1,778 million in 2023 due to lower realized crude oil prices and higher operating expenses. However, this decline was partially offset by lower taxes other than income taxes, which were directly tied to the drop in crude prices. In 2021, higher crude prices had led to increased taxes other than income taxes, negatively impacting earnings, while in 2023, the opposite occurred\u2014lower prices reduced these taxes, providing a partial earnings boost. This pattern reveals that the Alaska segment's profitability is highly sensitive to crude oil price movements, not only through direct revenue changes but also through the secondary effect on tax liabilities. The company-wide net income also reflected this trend, with lower taxes other than income taxes cited as a positive factor in 2023, despite the overall decline in earnings.",

      "question": "How did the acquisition of Marathon Oil in 2024 impact COP's Lower 48 segment, and what was the resulting effect on natural gas production volumes compared to 2022?",
      "answer": "The acquisition of Marathon Oil in 2024 significantly boosted COP's Lower 48 segment, adding 334 MBOED of production in December 2024 alone. This contributed to a total natural gas production of 1,625 MMcfD in 2024 for the Lower 48, up from 1,402 MMcfD in 2022. The acquisition not only expanded COP's asset base but also increased production volumes, reversing earlier declines and strengthening the segment's contribution to overall company output.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

In 2023, the interest coverage ratio calculation explicitly included the same line item, net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, as a subtraction from pre-tax income to determine the numerator before dividing by before-tax interest costs. A lower amount attributable to noncontrolling interests in 2023 (e.g., $18 million) would have increased the subtotal used to calculate the interest coverage ratio, contributing to a potentially stronger ratio compared to 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2022, COP's U.S. pension expense was directly impacted by interest rate changes, with a +/- 25 basis point shift affecting the expense by $45 million or $(50) million. This sensitivity was tied to their investments in U.S. plans, where COP contributed $115 million in 2022. By 2023, COP's interest rate risk profile had evolved to focus on debt instruments, with the company noting that a 10% change in interest rates would not materially affect interest expense on floating-rate debt. This reflects a strategic shift from pension-related interest rate exposure to direct debt-related risk, while maintaining active investment in U.S. plans.",

At times, our PP&amp;E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.  As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.  For more information on our impairments, see Note 6 and Note 7 .\n- Effective tax rate .  Our operations are in countries  with different tax rates  and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly  between periods based on the 'mix' of before-tax earnings within our global operations.\n- Fiscal and regulatory environment .  Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments.  These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.  Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Production and Capital\n\n2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion.  The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and $0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.\n\nProduction guidance is 1.8 MMBOED in 2022 including Libya but excluding the impacts from the pending Indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional APLNG shareholding interest.  First quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 MMBOED to 1.79 MMBOED.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\n\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\n\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow,  reflect results from our operations,  including commodity prices and production.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVX reported an Interest Coverage Ratio of 29.0, calculated using a subtotal of $22,502 million after adjustments including a $64 million deduction for net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. By 2024, the Interest Coverage Ratio had increased to 36.5, based on a subtotal of $28,226 million, which included a $88 million deduction for net income attributable to noncontrolling interests. The increase in this deduction from $64 million to $88 million over the two-year period was offset by stronger pre-tax income growth, contributing to a higher Interest Coverage Ratio.

      "question": "How did Chevron's Return on Average Capital Employed change from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the efficiency of capital utilization given the evolution in how average capital employed is computed?",
      "answer": "Chevron's Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) decreased from 20.3% in 2022 to 10.1% in 2024, despite average capital employed increasing from $177,445 million to $180,232 million over the same period. This significant drop in ROCE suggests a decline in the efficiency of capital utilization. The computation of average capital employed, which is based on the average of beginning and ending capital employed for the year, may reflect growing investments that have not yet translated into proportionate earnings. In 2022, capital employed was defined as the sum of Chevron Corporation Stockholders' Equity, total debt, and noncontrolling interests, and this definition appears consistent in 2024, indicating the decline in ROCE is not due to methodological changes but rather to lower returns relative to the capital base.",

      "question": "How did Chevron's 2023 crude oil reserve impairment framework influence its 2024 strategy for developing proved undeveloped reserves, particularly regarding the 70 million BOE increase from the PDC acquisition?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron\u2019s crude oil reserves were subject to impairment assessments triggered by downward revisions in reserves or price outlooks, which required management to evaluate the recoverability of asset carrying values based on assumptions like future commodity prices and production profiles (CVX 2023). This framework directly shaped the company\u2019s strategic decisions in 2024, where it actively advanced the development of proved undeveloped reserves through significant capital investments, including $5.5 billion in U.S. development activities. Notably, the 2024 reserves disclosures show that Chevron added 70 million BOE in the United States from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC (CVX 2024). This suggests that the impairment discipline applied in 2023 informed a more targeted and capital-efficient development strategy in 2024, prioritizing high-value acquisitions and projects that could be efficiently converted into developed reserves.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

      "answer": "In 2023, XOM reported a significant drop in natural gas realization, falling from $7.48 per thousand cubic feet in 2022 to $4.26 in 2023, indicating weaker market conditions. This decline in realization suggests increased exposure to natural gas price volatility, which was further confirmed in 2024 when the company noted that natural gas prices had fallen toward the middle of the 10-year range due to strong supply and lower demand through the first nine months of the year. In response, XOM emphasized structural cost savings, achieving $2.4 billion in savings during 2024, to mitigate the impact of lower prices on earnings, as part of a broader strategy to reduce structural costs by $6 billion by 2030.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Recent Business Environment\n\nDuring 2024, the price of crude oil remained near the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range (2010-2019), as markets remained balanced. Through the first nine months of the year, natural gas prices declined towards the middle of the 10-year range due to strong supply and lower demand. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices increased on rising demand driven by colder weather in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nRefining margins declined in 2024 from high 2023 levels as increased supply from industry capacity additions outpaced record global demand and remain near the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins improved slightly in 2024 but remained well below the 10-year range driven by over-supply, primarily in Asia.\n\nThe general rate of inflation across major countries peaked in 2022, rising from already elevated levels in 2021, due to additional impacts on energy and other commodities from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Inflation has trended down since 2023 as a result of aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks and slowing  global  economic  growth.  However,  there  has  been  significant  variation  on  the  pace  of  change  across  OECD  and  non-OECD  countries.  With  inflation gradually approaching the official targets in the  U.S. and  Eurozone, the  Federal  Reserve and the  European  Central  Bank began lowering interest rates in 2024. Meanwhile, China has been under persistent deflationary pressure since 2023.\n\nThe Corporation closely monitors market trends and works to mitigate both operating and capital cost impacts in all price environments. Organizational changes implemented over the past several years enabled the Corporation to capture $12.1 billion of structural cost savings versus 2019, including $2.4 billion of savings during 2024, through increased operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-saving measures. The Company sees additional opportunities in areas such as supply chain efficiency, improved maintenance and turnarounds, modernized data management, centralization of activities, and simplified business processes. These savings are key drivers to further reduce our structural costs by $6 billion by 2030, thereby improving the earnings power of the Corporation. ( 1 )\n\nRefer to Frequently Used Terms for definition of structural cost savings. (1)\n\n## Transportation of Kazakhstan Production\n\nThe Corporation holds a 25 percent interest in Tengizchevroil, LLP (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan, and a 16.8 percent working interest in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Oil production from those operations is exported primarily through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which the Corporation holds a 7.5 percent interest. CPC traverses parts of Kazakhstan and Russia to tanker-loading facilities on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. In the event geopolitical issues escalate in the region, including ongoing military conflict, it is possible that the transportation of Kazakhstan oil through the CPC pipeline could be disrupted, curtailed, temporarily suspended, or otherwise restricted. In such a case, the Corporation could experience a loss of cash flows of uncertain duration from its operations in Kazakhstan. For reference, after-tax  earnings related to the Corporation's interests in Kazakhstan in 2024 were approx imately $1.9 billion, and its share of combined oil and gas production was approximately 260 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day.",

See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil.

Additionally, revenues increased from higher overall commodity prices of $153 million, driven primarily by higher bitumen prices. See Note 3.\n\nDecreases to earnings included higher production and operating expenses of $215 million; driven by an impact of $175 million related to higher overall production, including our increased working interest in Surmont; as well as expenses of $55 million related to turnaround activity at Surmont. Additional decreases to earnings included higher DD&amp;A expenses of $166 million resulting from higher volumes and the absence of a $92 million tax benefit recognized upon the closing of a Canada Revenue Agency audit in 2023.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 60 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023. Increases to production resulted from our increased working interest in Surmont as well as new wells online in the Montney and Surmont. See Note 3.\n\nThese production increases were partly offset by higher downtime resulting from a planned turnaround activity at a Surmont central processing facility and normal field decline.",

      "answer": "In 2021, the Alaska segment contributed less than 1% of ConocoPhillips' consolidated natural gas production, while delivering strong earnings of $1,386 million driven by higher crude oil prices and reduced exploration costs. By 2024, the Lower 48 segment had become the dominant contributor, accounting for 74% of consolidated natural gas production. This shift reflects a strategic realignment toward more gas-weighted production, with the Alaska segment's minimal gas contribution highlighting a continued focus on liquids and a reduced role in the company's overall gas portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP's EMENA segment was one of six operating segments, indicating its role in contributing to overall production, though no specific percentage of liquids production was disclosed for that year. By 2024, EMENA operations contributed 9% of COP's consolidated liquids production. This shift suggests a more defined or potentially growing role of the EMENA region in COP's liquids output, aligning with strategic decisions to emphasize certain geographic areas. The 9% contribution in 2024 highlights EMENA's continued, though moderate, importance in COP's global liquids production portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: COP(2023) \u2192 EMENA Segment: COP reported EMENA as one of six global operating segments, but no specific production metrics were disclosed for this segment in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: EMENA Segment \u2192 Liquids Production: In 2024, EMENA was identified as contributing 9% of consolidated liquids production, establishing its role in COP's upstream liquids output.",
        "Hop 3: Liquids Production \u2190 COP(2024): The 9% contribution figure for EMENA in 2024 allows for a temporal comparison, showing how the region's role in liquids production evolved from 2023, when no specific figure was given but the segment was active."

      "answer": "In 2022, XOM reported that higher average prices caused certain quantities of natural gas to qualify as proved reserves, increasing the base of natural gas reserves. These additions contributed to the overall reserve base that evolved into proved developed reserves by 2024. In 2024, XOM disclosed that the Americas region held 176 billion cubic feet of natural gas in proved developed reserves, reflecting the maturation of earlier reserve additions.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Recent Business Environment\n\nDuring 2024, the price of crude oil remained near the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range (2010-2019), as markets remained balanced. Through the first nine months of the year, natural gas prices declined towards the middle of the 10-year range due to strong supply and lower demand. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices increased on rising demand driven by colder weather in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nRefining margins declined in 2024 from high 2023 levels as increased supply from industry capacity additions outpaced record global demand and remain near the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins improved slightly in 2024 but remained well below the 10-year range driven by over-supply, primarily in Asia.\n\nThe general rate of inflation across major countries peaked in 2022, rising from already elevated levels in 2021, due to additional impacts on energy and other commodities from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Inflation has trended down since 2023 as a result of aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks and slowing  global  economic  growth.  However,  there  has  been  significant  variation  on  the  pace  of  change  across  OECD  and  non-OECD  countries.  With  inflation gradually approaching the official targets in the  U.S. and  Eurozone, the  Federal  Reserve and the  European  Central  Bank began lowering interest rates in 2024. Meanwhile, China has been under persistent deflationary pressure since 2023.\n\nThe Corporation closely monitors market trends and works to mitigate both operating and capital cost impacts in all price environments. Organizational changes implemented over the past several years enabled the Corporation to capture $12.1 billion of structural cost savings versus 2019, including $2.4 billion of savings during 2024, through increased operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-saving measures. The Company sees additional opportunities in areas such as supply chain efficiency, improved maintenance and turnarounds, modernized data management, centralization of activities, and simplified business processes. These savings are key drivers to further reduce our structural costs by $6 billion by 2030, thereby improving the earnings power of the Corporation. ( 1 )\n\nRefer to Frequently Used Terms for definition of structural cost savings. (1)\n\n## Transportation of Kazakhstan Production\n\nThe Corporation holds a 25 percent interest in Tengizchevroil, LLP (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan, and a 16.8 percent working interest in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Oil production from those operations is exported primarily through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which the Corporation holds a 7.5 percent interest. CPC traverses parts of Kazakhstan and Russia to tanker-loading facilities on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. In the event geopolitical issues escalate in the region, including ongoing military conflict, it is possible that the transportation of Kazakhstan oil through the CPC pipeline could be disrupted, curtailed, temporarily suspended, or otherwise restricted. In such a case, the Corporation could experience a loss of cash flows of uncertain duration from its operations in Kazakhstan. For reference, after-tax  earnings related to the Corporation's interests in Kazakhstan in 2024 were approx imately $1.9 billion, and its share of combined oil and gas production was approximately 260 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day.",

      "question": "How did the change in Chevron's total financing interest and debt costs from 2023 ($617M) to 2024 impact its interest coverage ratio, given that the ratio calculation methodology remained consistent across both years?",
      "answer": "Chevron's total financing interest and debt costs decreased from $630 million in 2023 to $617 million in 2024, indicating a slight reduction in debt servicing expenses. While the actual interest coverage ratio for 2024 is not disclosed, the ratio calculation methodology remained consistent between years, referencing income before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense, plus amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. Given the decline in financing costs and assuming stable or improved pre-tax income, Chevron's interest coverage capacity likely improved in 2024, suggesting stronger ability to service debt obligations compared to the prior year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, COP's Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment contributed 12% of consolidated liquids production, with operations in Libya highlighted in the production guidance. By 2024, the Lower 48 segment became the largest contributor at 63% of consolidated liquids production, signaling a strategic shift toward domestic U.S. operations. This change reflects a broader geographic reallocation of production emphasis, likely driven by geopolitical considerations, capital efficiency, and the desire to leverage low-cost unconventional plays in a more stable regulatory environment.",

          "chunk_text": "- Impairments .  We participate in a capital  -intensive industry.  At times, our PP&amp;E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.  As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.  For more information on our impairments, see Note 6 and Note 7 .\n- Effective tax rate .  Our operations are in countries  with different tax rates  and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly  between periods based on the 'mix' of before-tax earnings within our global operations.\n- Fiscal and regulatory environment .  Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments.  These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.  Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Production and Capital\n\n2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion.  The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and $0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.\n\nProduction guidance is 1.8 MMBOED in 2022 including Libya but excluding the impacts from the pending Indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional APLNG shareholding interest.  First quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 MMBOED to 1.79 MMBOED.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\n\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\n\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow,  reflect results from our operations,  including commodity prices and production.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron's (CVX) international downstream earnings were negatively impacted by an unfavorable swing in foreign currency effects of $247 million, contributing to a total earnings decline of $528 million. This reflects a negative relationship between foreign currency effects and international downstream earnings. By 2024, foreign currency effects had shifted dramatically, showing a $520 million gain compared to a $224 million loss in the prior year\u2014a $744 million year-over-year improvement. This significant positive swing likely provided a strong upward adjustment to Chevron\u2019s international downstream earnings in 2024, reversing the prior year's drag. The evolution from a negative impact in 2023 to a strong positive contribution in 2024 indicates a reversal in the financial pressure from currency movements across the two years.",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP's Alaska segment reported earnings of $1,778 million. By 2024, earnings from the Alaska segment decreased to $1,326 million, partly due to higher production and operating expenses, which rose by $90 million driven by increased well work activity ($56 million) and transportation costs ($26 million). Overall, COP's consolidated production and operating expenses increased by $1,058 million in 2024, with Alaska and the Lower 48 segments contributing significantly to this rise. The acquisition of additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit in late 2024 added approximately five MBOED in monthly production for November and December, which likely contributed to the increased operating costs in the segment. This reflects a temporal evolution where strategic asset expansion in Alaska coincided with rising operational costs and declining segment profitability.",

The carrying values were written down to fair value.  The fair values were estimated based on internal discounted cash flow models using the following estimated assumptions: estimated future production, an outlook of future prices from a combination of exchanges (short-term) coupled with pricing service companies and our internal outlook (long-term), future operating costs and capital expenditures, and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants. The range and arithmetic average of significant unobservable inputs used in the Level 3 fair value measurements for significant assets were as follows:",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico and commercial operations. During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "answer": "In 2022, ConocoPhillips disclosed contingent payments related to prior dispositions in its Canada and Lower 48 segments, though the specific structure of these liabilities was not detailed. By 2023, the contingent payments related to the Canada segment were explicitly tied to the Surmont acquisition, with future quarterly payments up to $0.4 billion CAD contingent on WCS crude prices exceeding $52 per barrel. This introduced a clear commodity price sensitivity mechanism absent in the more general contingent obligations mentioned in 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "- Impairments .  We participate in a capital  -intensive industry.  At times, our PP&amp;E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.  As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.  For more information on our impairments, see Note 6 and Note 7 .\n- Effective tax rate .  Our operations are in countries  with different tax rates  and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly  between periods based on the 'mix' of before-tax earnings within our global operations.\n- Fiscal and regulatory environment .  Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments.  These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.  Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Production and Capital\n\n2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion.  The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and $0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.\n\nProduction guidance is 1.8 MMBOED in 2022 including Libya but excluding the impacts from the pending Indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional APLNG shareholding interest.  First quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 MMBOED to 1.79 MMBOED.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\n\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\n\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow,  reflect results from our operations,  including commodity prices and production.",

See Note 3 .\n- A gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020.\n- Lower exploration expenses due to:\n- o Absence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after  -tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset.\n- o Lower dry hole expenses.\n- o Absence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska.\n- o Absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans.\n- Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices.\n- Contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments.\n- An after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a FID bonus associated with our Australia -West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3 .\n- Lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7 .\n\nThese increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:\n\n- Higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes.\n- Higher DD&amp;A expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021.\n- Absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our Australia-West divestiture completed in May 2020.\n- Restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the Concho and Shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.",

      "question": "How did the impact of divestments on natural gas production volumes evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what does this indicate about ExxonMobil's asset portfolio strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, divestments were explicitly cited as a factor reducing natural gas production, contributing to a decrease of 923 million cubic feet per day compared to 2019. By 2023, natural gas production available for sale dropped further to 7,734 million cubic feet per day from 8,295 million cubic feet per day in 2022. This continued decline indicates that divestments remained a key driver in reducing production volumes, aligning with a broader asset portfolio strategy of divesting non-core assets to focus on higher-margin operations.",

        "Hop 1: XOM(2022) \u2192 Divestments: XOM's 2022 disclosures explicitly identify divestments as a material factor reducing natural gas production by 923 million cubic feet per day compared to 2019.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(1) Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels.\n\nListed below are descriptions of ExxonMobil's volumes reconciliation factors which are provided to facilitate understanding of the terms.\n\nEntitlements  -  Net  Interest are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  share  of  production  volumes  caused  by  non-operational  changes  to volume-determining factors. These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CVX's 'All Other' segment reported a net charge of $329 million, indicating a financial burden. By 2024, the segment explicitly included real estate activities as part of its composition, alongside cash management, debt financing, insurance, and technology companies. The continued presence of real estate within the 'All Other' segment in 2024 suggests that it remained a non-core but persistent component of the business, potentially contributing to the segment\u2019s financial volatility. However, without specific 2024 financial details for real estate activities alone, it's unclear whether they improved or worsened the overall performance of 'All Other' from the 2023 baseline of $329M net charge.",

Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and  regional  supply-and-demand  balance  for  refined  products  and  petrochemicals,  and  by  changes  in  the  price  of  crude  oil,  other  refinery  and  petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\n\nOther factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company's shipping operations, which are driven by the industry's demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company's control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe company's most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. The company is also one of the largest renewable fuels producers in the United States.\n\nRefer to the 'Results of Operations' section on page 44 for additional discussion of the company's downstream operations.\n\nAll Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "answer": "The increase in COP's international pension compensation growth rate from 3.17% in 2022 to 3.65% in 2023 directly contributed to a rise in the company's long-term pension liability obligations. In 2022, the international pension benefits obligation was $152 million, and by 2023, it had increased to $219 million \u2014 a 44% increase \u2014 despite a higher discount rate (from 2.33% to 3.65%). This indicates that the upward revision in the rate of compensation increase outpaced the liability-reducing effect of the higher discount rate. As a result, the trend suggests growing benefit cost pressures in future periods due to higher assumed wage growth, which will likely lead to increased net periodic benefit costs on the income statement.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVX reported net charges of $3,107 million, which included foreign currency effects and other operating costs. By 2024, net charges increased by $462 million, partly due to severance charges and higher employee benefit costs, although partially offset by a favorable $587 million swing in foreign currency effects. Severance charges directly contributed to a rise in operating expenses, which in turn reduced income before tax. Specifically, U.S. income before tax dropped by $0.5 billion (from $8.6B to $8.1B), with severance charges cited as a key driver alongside lower downstream margins and upstream realizations. Internationally, income before tax fell by $1.6 billion (from $21.0B to $19.5B), again citing severance charges as a primary contributor, despite the absence of decommissioning charges from prior divestitures acting as a partial offset. This shows how severance-related cost increases in 2024 directly pressured operating performance across both upstream and downstream segments compared to 2022.",

      "answer": "Chevron's net income attributable to noncontrolling interests dropped from $42 million in 2023 to $0 in 2024. This reduction contributed to an increase in the numerator of the interest coverage ratio (income before tax + interest and debt expense + amortization of capitalized interest - net income attributable to noncontrolling interests), improving the company's ability to service its debt. The interest coverage ratio itself, which stood at 49.0 in 2023, likely increased further in 2024 due to the elimination of this deduction, signaling stronger debt servicing capacity.",

      "question": "How did the role of ExxonMobil's Global Reserves and Resources Group evolve between 2023 and 2024 in managing proved reserves, particularly in terms of data integration technologies and internal controls over reserve estimation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, ExxonMobil's proved reserves estimation relied on integrated assessments using geological, engineering, and production data, including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data calibrated with well control information, interpreted via seismic processing, reservoir modeling, and data analysis tools. The Global Reserves and Resources Group oversaw this process, maintaining a central database with strict access controls and conducting annual internal audits to ensure data integrity. In 2024, the Group continued to apply the same rigorous methodologies but emphasized further integration of analog reservoir data to enhance confidence in reserves estimates. The staffing of the Group remained consistent, with an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry and the Group Manager having over 30 years of reservoir engineering experience. The internal controls remained robust, requiring endorsement by the Group for any changes to reserves estimates and final review by senior management. This continuity indicates that while the core responsibilities of the Group remained stable, the emphasis on analog data integration in 2024 reflects a strategic refinement in managing proved reserves estimation under evolving subsurface and market conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "In the preceding reserves information, consolidated subsidiary and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation operates its business with the same view of equity company reserves as it has for reserves from consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from  year  to  year  due  to  the  timing  of  individual  project  start-ups;  operational  outages;  reservoir  performance;  regulatory  changes;  the  impact  of  fiscal  and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; international trade patterns and relations; and other factors described in Item 1A.\n\nThe estimation of proved reserves, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of reservoir and well performance. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in E stablishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2024\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2024 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including high-quality 3-D and 4-D seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn  some  circumstances,  where  appropriate  analog  reservoirs  were  available,  reservoir  parameters  from  these  analogs  were  used  to  increase  the  quality  of  and confidence in the reserves estimates.\n\n## C. Qualifications of Reserves Technical Oversight Group and Internal Controls over Proved Reserves\n\nExxonMobil  has  a  dedicated  G lobal  Reserves  and  Resources  group  that  provides  technical  oversight  and  is  separate  from  the  operating  organization.  Primary responsibilities  of  this  group  include  oversight  of  the  reserves  estimation  process  for  compliance  with  Securities  and  Ex change  Commission  (SEC)  rules  and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates, and the reporting of ExxonMobil's proved reserves. This group also maintains the official company reserves estimates for ExxonMobil's proved reserves of crude oil, natural gas liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil, and natural gas. In addition, the group provides training to personnel involved in the reserves estimation and reporting process within ExxonMobil and its affiliates. The current G lobal Reserves and Resources Manager has more than 30 years of experience in reservoir engineering and reserves assessment, has a degree in Engineering, and serves on the Oil and G as Reserves Committee of the Society of Petroleum Engineers. The group is staffed with individuals that have an average of more than 15 years of technical experience in the petroleum industry, including expertise in the classification and categorization of reserves under SEC guidelines. This group includes individuals who hold degrees in either Engineering or Geology.\n\nThe  Global  Reserves  and  Resources  group  maintains  a  central  database  containing  the  official  company  reserves  estimates.  Appropriate  controls,  including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system's controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long-standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to the reserves estimates in the central database, including additions of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless these changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized geoscience and engineering professionals within the operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and approval by the appropriate level of management within the operating organization before the changes may be made in the central database. Endorsement by the Global Reserves and Resources group for all proved reserves changes is a mandatory component of this review process. After all changes are made, reviews are held with senior management for final endorsement.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "Chevron's ROCE increased from 9.4% in 2022 to 12.1% in 2023. This improvement suggests a stronger ability to generate returns on its capital investments, particularly given that its average capital employed remained relatively stable at around $174 billion across both years. The increase in ROCE was primarily driven by a rise in net income attributable to Chevron, which increased from $15,625 million in 2022 to $20,328 million in 2023. This indicates improved operational performance and capital efficiency over the two-year period.",

        "Hop 1: CVX(2022) \u2192 Average Capital Employed: Chevron reported an average capital employed of $174,175 million in 2022, which is a key input into the ROCE calculation.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "Chevron's ROCE declined from 20.3% in 2022 to 10.1% in 2024. This significant drop was influenced by both lower adjusted net income (from $36,084 million in 2022 to $18,288 million in 2024) and an increase in Average Capital Employed (from $177,445 million to $180,232 million). Despite the relatively modest 1.6% rise in capital employed, the nearly 50% decline in earnings after adjustments was the primary driver of the reduced ROCE, indicating deteriorating efficiency in generating returns from its capital base.",

By 2024, the Lower 48 segment had become the largest contributor, accounting for 74% of consolidated natural gas production. This shift indicates a strategic reallocation of capital and operational focus from international assets, including those in the Europe, Middle East and North Africa region, to the more cost-efficient and high-impact unconventional plays in the U.S., as highlighted in COP's 2022 operating plan which allocated $7.2 billion in capital with a focus on development drilling and low-carbon opportunities.",

At times, our PP&amp;E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.  As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.  For more information on our impairments, see Note 6 and Note 7 .\n- Effective tax rate .  Our operations are in countries  with different tax rates  and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly  between periods based on the 'mix' of before-tax earnings within our global operations.\n- Fiscal and regulatory environment .  Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments.  These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.  Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Production and Capital\n\n2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion.  The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and $0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.\n\nProduction guidance is 1.8 MMBOED in 2022 including Libya but excluding the impacts from the pending Indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional APLNG shareholding interest.  First quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 MMBOED to 1.79 MMBOED.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\n\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\n\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow,  reflect results from our operations,  including commodity prices and production.",

This decline in ROCE was primarily due to a sharp drop in net income after adjustments, which fell from $36,084M in 2022 to $18,288M in 2024.

      "answer": "In 2022, COP disclosed a U.S. Pension Benefits liability of $369M. By 2023, this liability dropped to $185M, a significant reduction. During the same period, the Rate of Compensation Increase assumption used for pension calculations increased from 4.29% in 2022 (based on industry-standard actuarial data) to 5.00% in 2023, as disclosed in COP\u2019s 10-K. Typically, a higher compensation increase assumption would increase pension liabilities, yet COP\u2019s liability decreased. This counterintuitive outcome suggests that other actuarial assumptions\u2014such as the discount rate increase to 5.35% in 2023\u2014had a more dominant effect in reducing the liability than the upward adjustment in the compensation growth assumption.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Chevron's 'All Other' segment reported a loss of $329 million. By 2024, this segment experienced a net charge of $462 million, driven by higher employee benefit costs, severance charges, and lower interest income. These factors were partially offset by favorable foreign currency effects. The 'All Other' segment includes corporate administrative functions, indicating that internal cost pressures increased year-over-year, particularly in personnel and restructuring-related expenses. This suggests a more costly overhead structure in 2024 compared to 2023, with implications for overall cost management strategy.",

Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and  regional  supply-and-demand  balance  for  refined  products  and  petrochemicals,  and  by  changes  in  the  price  of  crude  oil,  other  refinery  and  petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\n\nOther factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company's shipping operations, which are driven by the industry's demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company's control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe company's most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. The company is also one of the largest renewable fuels producers in the United States.\n\nRefer to the 'Results of Operations' section on page 44 for additional discussion of the company's downstream operations.\n\nAll Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "answer": "COP's Alaska segment liquids production contribution dropped from 19% in 2021 to 14% in 2024, reflecting ongoing field decline. This decline in production base, combined with 2023 year-end downward reserve revisions, directly contributed to a $175 million increase in DD&A expenses in 2024. The higher DD&A rates were a result of these reserve revisions and increased production costs, despite the acquisition of additional working interests in late 2024. This illustrates how sustained field decline and reserve adjustments led to higher per-unit depletion costs, even as new wells and assets partially offset production declines.",

      "answer": "COP's DD&A expenses increased from $8,270 million in 2023 to $9,599 million in 2024, a rise of $1,329 million. Within this, the Alaska segment experienced a $175 million increase in DD&A expenses, driven by higher depletion rates due to 2023 year-end downward reserve revisions and increased production costs. This contributed to a decline in Alaska's earnings from $1,778 million in 2023 to $1,326 million in 2024, despite new wells coming online in the Western North Slope and Greater Kuparuk Area. The overall performance reflects how asset-level changes and cost pressures in the Alaska segment fed into broader corporate financial trends.",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP's Lower 48 segment experienced a production decline of 202 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (MBOED), contributing to a reduction in reserves and potentially limiting earnings potential. However, in 2024, the acquisition of Marathon Oil added approximately 334 MBOED in December alone, leading to an overall production increase of 85 MBOED year-over-year. Despite this volume growth, Lower 48 earnings declined from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024, primarily due to lower commodity prices and higher operating costs, including $562 million in increased DD&A and $431 million in higher production expenses. The acquisition-driven production gains were not sufficient to offset these financial pressures, highlighting how the 2023 production decline may have set a weaker baseline that the 2024 rebound could not fully overcome.",

        "Hop 1: COP(2023) \u2192 Production: In 2023, Lower 48 production declined by 202 MBOED, indicating a reduction in operational output.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "In 2023, DD&A was a standard financial metric applied across ConocoPhillips' operations, including the Lower 48 segment. By 2024, DD&A expenses in the Lower 48 segment increased by $562 million, driven by higher production ($250 million), higher depletion rates ($181 million), and the acquisition of Marathon Oil ($139 million). This increase directly contributed to a decline in Lower 48 segment earnings from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024, despite higher production volumes. The acquisition of Marathon Oil added $13.2 billion in provisional fair value of proved oil and gas properties to the Lower 48 segment, which further contributed to higher DD&A rates and long-term asset amortization pressures.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "The Alaska segment's contribution to COP's consolidated liquids production dropped from 19% in 2021 to 15% in 2023, reflecting a 5 MBOED production decline in 2023 compared to 2022. This decline was primarily due to normal field decline, despite new wells coming online at Western North Slope and the Greater Kuparuk Area. In response, COP pursued strategic actions including reaching FID on the Willow project in Alaska in December 2023, aiming to offset the decline through new core pads. Meanwhile, COP's Canadian operations contributed 7% of consolidated liquids production in 2023, indicating a broader strategy to diversify liquids production sources across regions.",

      "question": "How did Chevron's disclosure of Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) in 2024 relate to its 2022 capital base, given that the company reported an average capital employed of $174.2 billion in 2022 and continued to define ROCE using the same methodology in 2024?",
      "answer": "Chevron's 2024 disclosure of ROCE continued to use the same calculation methodology as in 2022, which defines ROCE as adjusted net income divided by average capital employed. In 2022, Chevron reported an average capital employed of $174.2 billion, which served as the denominator for ROCE calculations. The 2024 filing reaffirmed this definition, indicating consistency in how the company measures capital efficiency over time. However, without the actual 2024 ROCE value or updated average capital employed figure for 2024, we cannot assess whether capital efficiency improved or declined compared to 2022. The continued use of the same methodology allows for direct comparability between years, but full analysis requires the 2024 performance metric.",

        "Hop 3: ROCE \u2190 CVX(2024): CVX reaffirmed the same ROCE definition in 2024, maintaining consistency in methodology, though actual ROCE value for 2024 is not disclosed."

However, CVX's overall natural gas proved reserves decreased by 572 BCF in the U.S. in 2024 due to reservoir performance in the DJ Basin, which offset some of the international gains.

By 2024, foreign currency effects had swung to a positive $520 million, contributing favorably to the year-over-year change. This $587 million swing was specifically cited in the 2024 filing as a partial offset to the $462 million increase in net charges, indicating that without this favorable currency movement, the increase in net charges would have been significantly larger.

The volume of reserves sold dropped from 0.2 GOEB in 2023 to 0.1 GOEB in 2024, primarily in the U.S. and Nigeria, respectively.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

This decline aligns with the broader market trend where natural gas prices also fell, as seen in the industry-wide average realizations that decreased from $7.48 per MCF in 2022 to $4.26 per MCF in 2023. However, Chevron's drop in realization was more pronounced than the industry average, which could suggest a shift in their regional sales mix or a change in contract structure that exposed them more directly to spot pricing.

Despite this financial resolution, the Asia Pacific segment contributed only 2% to COP's consolidated natural gas production in 2024. This remained significantly lower than the Lower 48 segment, which dominated with 74% of consolidated natural gas production.

      "answer": "In 2022, COP reported a rate of compensation increase of 3.17% for international pension benefits. By 2024, this rate had increased to 4.05%. This upward trend in the compensation growth assumption suggests that COP anticipates higher future liabilities tied to international pension benefits, which is consistent with the increase in the projected liability amount from $152 million in 2022 to $316 million by the end of 2024. The change in the rate reflects a more aggressive liability growth assumption over time.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Lower 48 Segment contributed 64% of COP's consolidated liquids production, highlighting its central role in the company's output. In 2024, COP acquired Marathon Oil, which added $13.2 billion in recognized proved oil and gas properties to the Lower 48 Segment. Analysts may interpret this acquisition as a strategic move to significantly enhance the segment\u2019s future liquids production capacity. Although the 2024 filing does not provide an updated contribution percentage, the substantial addition of proved properties implies that the Lower 48 Segment\u2019s relative contribution to COP\u2019s total liquids production could increase in subsequent years, assuming successful integration and development of the acquired assets.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "question": "How did Chevron's 2023 impairment sensitivity around natural gas reserves influence its 2024 proved undeveloped reserves, particularly in light of the $8.2 billion invested in oil and gas development and the 58 million BOE decrease tied to lower natural gas prices?",
      "answer": "Chevron's 2023 impairment assessments, which emphasized sensitivity to factors like commodity prices and regulatory changes, directly informed its 2024 reserve management strategy. In 2023, the company noted that downward revisions to natural gas reserves would trigger impairment reviews and that lower prices could significantly affect asset recoverability. By 2024, this sensitivity materialized as lower natural gas prices in North America caused a 58 million BOE decrease in proved reserves. Despite this, Chevron allocated $8.2 billion to oil and gas development, with $5.5 billion directed toward U.S. shale plays like the DJ, Midland, and Delaware basins. This investment led to 316 million BOE in extensions and discoveries in the U.S., including 171 million BOE in the DJ basin. However, the company also transferred 464 million BOE from proved undeveloped to proved developed reserves in the U.S., indicating active development of previously held reserves. The 2023 impairment framework thus shaped the 2024 reserve dynamics, where price sensitivity led to both reductions and strategic development-driven additions.",

        "Hop 1: CVX(2023) \u2192 Natural Gas Reserves: Chevron highlighted in 2023 that downward revisions in natural gas reserves would trigger impairment reviews, with commodity prices being a key sensitivity factor.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

      "answer": "Chevron's interest and debt expense increased from $712 million in 2022 to $775 million in 2023, which contributed to a stronger interest coverage ratio despite rising debt costs. According to the 2023 filing, the interest coverage ratio is calculated as (income before tax + interest and debt expense + amortization of capitalized interest - net income attributable to noncontrolling interests) divided by before-tax interest costs. This methodology shows that even with higher interest expenses, Chevron's improved earnings before tax and stable amortization costs helped maintain a robust ability to service debt obligations as reflected in the 2023 interest coverage ratio calculation.",

      "answer": "In 2023, XOM reported a drop in crude oil realization from $87.25 per barrel in 2022 to $69.85 per barrel, indicating reduced revenue per unit of oil sold. This decrease in realization likely increased the company's sensitivity to crude oil price fluctuations, especially if operational costs remained fixed or declined less rapidly. By 2024, crude oil prices remained stable near the pre-COVID 10-year range, which constrained revenue growth potential. However, XOM managed to achieve $2.4 billion in structural cost savings during the year, helping offset some of the margin pressures caused by the lower realization environment and stable pricing. These savings were part of a broader $12.1 billion cumulative savings since 2019, demonstrating how cost discipline was leveraged to mitigate the impact of sustained lower realizations and stable crude prices.",

          "chunk_text": "## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Recent Business Environment\n\nDuring 2024, the price of crude oil remained near the middle of the pre-COVID 10-year range (2010-2019), as markets remained balanced. Through the first nine months of the year, natural gas prices declined towards the middle of the 10-year range due to strong supply and lower demand. In the fourth quarter, natural gas prices increased on rising demand driven by colder weather in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nRefining margins declined in 2024 from high 2023 levels as increased supply from industry capacity additions outpaced record global demand and remain near the bottom of the 10-year range. Chemical margins improved slightly in 2024 but remained well below the 10-year range driven by over-supply, primarily in Asia.\n\nThe general rate of inflation across major countries peaked in 2022, rising from already elevated levels in 2021, due to additional impacts on energy and other commodities from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Inflation has trended down since 2023 as a result of aggressive monetary tightening by major central banks and slowing  global  economic  growth.  However,  there  has  been  significant  variation  on  the  pace  of  change  across  OECD  and  non-OECD  countries.  With  inflation gradually approaching the official targets in the  U.S. and  Eurozone, the  Federal  Reserve and the  European  Central  Bank began lowering interest rates in 2024. Meanwhile, China has been under persistent deflationary pressure since 2023.\n\nThe Corporation closely monitors market trends and works to mitigate both operating and capital cost impacts in all price environments. Organizational changes implemented over the past several years enabled the Corporation to capture $12.1 billion of structural cost savings versus 2019, including $2.4 billion of savings during 2024, through increased operational efficiencies, workforce reductions, divestment-related reductions, and other cost-saving measures. The Company sees additional opportunities in areas such as supply chain efficiency, improved maintenance and turnarounds, modernized data management, centralization of activities, and simplified business processes. These savings are key drivers to further reduce our structural costs by $6 billion by 2030, thereby improving the earnings power of the Corporation. ( 1 )\n\nRefer to Frequently Used Terms for definition of structural cost savings. (1)\n\n## Transportation of Kazakhstan Production\n\nThe Corporation holds a 25 percent interest in Tengizchevroil, LLP (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev oil fields in Kazakhstan, and a 16.8 percent working interest in the Kashagan field in Kazakhstan. Oil production from those operations is exported primarily through the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), in which the Corporation holds a 7.5 percent interest. CPC traverses parts of Kazakhstan and Russia to tanker-loading facilities on the Russian coast of the Black Sea. In the event geopolitical issues escalate in the region, including ongoing military conflict, it is possible that the transportation of Kazakhstan oil through the CPC pipeline could be disrupted, curtailed, temporarily suspended, or otherwise restricted. In such a case, the Corporation could experience a loss of cash flows of uncertain duration from its operations in Kazakhstan. For reference, after-tax  earnings related to the Corporation's interests in Kazakhstan in 2024 were approx imately $1.9 billion, and its share of combined oil and gas production was approximately 260 thousand oil-equivalent barrels per day.",

      "answer": "In 2022, COP's Asia Pacific segment faced significant impairments, including a $688 million write-down on its APLNG investment, which likely constrained its contribution to consolidated natural gas production. By 2024, the Asia Pacific segment contributed only 2% to COP's consolidated natural gas production, a sign of reduced strategic emphasis in this region. Meanwhile, the Lower 48 segment rose to dominate production, contributing 74% of consolidated natural gas output in 2024. This shift indicates a strategic refocus toward domestic U.S. natural gas assets, where operational control and profitability may be more favorable.",

During that year, the company incurred $37 million in dry hole expenses in EMEAI, specifically tied to the Warka suspended discovery well in the Norwegian Sea. By 2024, despite continued operations in the region, dry hole expenses in EMEAI shifted to $40 million, with $22 million linked to two partner-operated exploration wells in the Alvheim area of the Norwegian sector of the North Sea. This suggests a strategic shift in exploration focus from operated wells in the Norwegian Sea (2023) to partner-operated wells in the North Sea (2024), even as natural gas production from the EMEAI segment remained a consistent contributor to overall production. The change in exploration expense patterns reflects a reallocation of exploration capital and risk-sharing through partnerships, potentially in response to earlier dry hole outcomes.",

      "question": "What was the impact of CVX's $462 million increase in net charges\u2014driven by severance costs\u2014on U.S. and international income before tax in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CVX reported net charges of $2,206 million, which included foreign currency effects of $588 million. In 2024, net charges increased by $462 million, primarily due to higher employee benefit costs and severance charges, as stated in the 2024 10-K filing. Severance charges directly contributed to higher operating expenses, which had a negative impact on income before tax. Specifically, U.S. income before tax decreased from $8.6 billion in 2023 to $8.1 billion in 2024, with severance charges cited as a key factor in the $0.5 billion decline. Similarly, international income before tax dropped from $21.0 billion in 2023 to $19.5 billion in 2024, with severance charges again listed among the contributing factors to the $1.5 billion decline. Thus, the $462 million rise in net charges, driven by severance costs, directly increased operating expenses and reduced income before tax in both U.S. and international segments in 2024.",

The increase of $1.5 billion in international income tax  ex pense between year-over-year periods, from $6.4 billion in 2023 to $7.9 billion in 2024, was primarily driven by the tax impacts of the asset sales in Canada, partially offset by the decrease in income before tax .\n\nRefer also to the discussion of the effective income tax  rate in Note 17 Tax es.",

      "answer": "In the 2022 disclosure, Chevron reported $682 million in 'Other Benefits' obligations for 2027-2031, which included 2027. In the 2023 disclosure, the specific amount for 2027 alone was $147 million, suggesting a more granular or revised projection compared to the earlier multi-year estimate. This shift from a multi-year aggregated figure to a specific annual amount indicates a refinement in how Chevron projects and discloses its long-term benefit liabilities, potentially reflecting updated actuarial assumptions or strategic changes in benefit planning.",

These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "Chevron's Return on Average Capital Employed (ROCE) decreased significantly from 20.3% in 2022 to 11.9% in 2023. This drop occurred despite a relatively high net income after adjustments of $21.8B in 2023, compared to $36.1B in 2022. The average capital employed increased from $177.4B in 2022 to $183.2B in 2023, indicating a larger capital base over which earnings were spread. This suggests that the decline in ROCE was partly driven by a less efficient use of capital in 2023 relative to 2022, as the increase in capital employed outpaced the growth in adjusted net income. The relationship between ROCE and average capital employed highlights a shift in Chevron's capital efficiency profile, with the company generating lower returns per unit of capital invested in 2023.",

The classification of these reserves as 'undeveloped' indicates that significant capital investment would be required to bring them into production, aligning with the SEC's requirement that proved reserves must be economically producible under existing economic conditions. The shift from 2022 to 2024 reflects a broader trend of reserve additions through acquisitions (e.g., Pioneer added 2.3 GOEB) and discoveries, which contributed to a more robust reserve base, including undeveloped reserves that may have previously been classified differently under alternate pricing or development scenarios.",

These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "question": "How did Chevron's 2022 crude oil reserves estimates influence their 2024 investment decisions in proved undeveloped reserves development across shale basins and international projects?",
      "answer": "Chevron's 2022 crude oil reserves estimates, which showed an upstream property, plant, and equipment value of $130.8 billion, directly informed their 2024 capital allocation strategy for proved undeveloped reserves. In 2024, the company invested $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, with $5.5 billion focused on shale development in key U.S. basins like the Midland, Delaware, and DJ basins. This aligns with the 2022 reserve estimation process where proved reserves data was critical for planning future development. The 2024 transfers of 464 million BOE to proved developed reserves in the U.S., particularly in the DJ basin (126 million BOE), Midland and Delaware basins (256 million BOE), and Gulf of America (82 million BOE), demonstrate how earlier reserve estimates guided specific development decisions. The 2024 proved undeveloped reserves in Other Americas (633 million barrels of crude oil) also reflect continued development of international assets first estimated in prior years.",

Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\nThe Impact of Proved Crude Oil and Natural Gas Reserves on Upstream Property, Plant, and Equipment, Net\n\nAs  described  in  Notes  1  and  18  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  the  Company's  upstream  property,  plant  and equipment, net balance was $130.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, and depreciation, depletion and amortization expense was $16.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. Depreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude  oil  and  natural  gas  producing  properties,  except  mineral  interests,  are  expensed  using  the  unit-of-production  method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral  interests  are  recognized  using  the  unit-of-production  method  by  individual  field  as  the  related  proved  reserves  are produced. As disclosed by management, variables impacting the Company's estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs. Reserves are estimated by Company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the Company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) (the Company's earth scientists, engineers and RAC are collectively referred to as 'management's specialists').\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the impact of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves on upstream property, plant, and equipment, net is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management, including the use of management's specialists, when developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes, which in turn led to (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the data, methods and assumptions used by management and its specialists in developing the estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion  on  the  consolidated  financial  statements. These  procedures  included  testing  the  effectiveness  of  controls  relating  to management's estimates of proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. The work of management's specialists was used in performing the procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of the proved crude oil and natural gas reserve volumes. As a basis for  using  this  work,  the  specialists'  qualifications  were  understood  and  the  Company's  relationship  with  the  specialists  was assessed. The procedures performed also included evaluation of the methods and assumptions used by the specialists, tests of the data used by the specialists and an evaluation of the specialists' findings.\n\n.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nSan Francisco, California February 24, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1935.",

          "chunk_text": "In 2024, revisions in the United States were primarily from the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin yielding a decrease of 98 million BOE mainly due to reservoir performance and portfolio optimization. A net decrease of 33 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins was due to reservoir performance.\n\nIn 2024, extensions and discoveries of 316 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the DJ basin of 171 million BOE, the Midland and Delaware basins of 123 million BOE, and deepwater assets in the G ulf of America of 22 million BOE. In Other Americas, 58 million BOE of extensions and discoveries were from shale and tight assets in Argentina.\n\nIn 2024, purchases of 70 million BOE in the United States are primarily from newly identified proved undeveloped well locations associated with the acquisition of PDC.\n\nThe difference in 2024 extensions and discoveries of 161 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 551 million BOE as reflected on pages 112 to 114 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 390 million BOE, is primarily due to proved extensions and discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2024.\n\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2024 include 464 million BOE in the United States, from 256 million BOE in the Midland and Delaware basins, 126 million BOE in the DJ basin, and 82 million BOE in the G ulf of America. Other significant transfers to proved developed were 329 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, and 75 million BOE in Angola, primarily at Angola LNG . A combined 81 million BOE of transfers to proved developed were recorded in Argentina, Canada, Australia, Nigeria, China, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\n\nDuring 2024, the company's investments totaled approximately $8.2 billion in oil and gas producing activities, and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities, to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $5.5 billion primarily related to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins, the G ulf of America and the DJ basin. In Africa, about $0.8 billion was ex pended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria and Angola. An additional $0.5 billion was spent on development activities in Australia. Development activities in other international locations were primarily responsible for about $1.4 billion of ex penditures. The company's equity affiliates investments in oil and gas producing activities to advance development of proved undeveloped reserves in 2024 was $1.3 billion primarily related to development projects for TCO in Kazakhstan.\n\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\n\nAt year-end 2024, the company held approximately 624 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 223 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the G orgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints, reservoir depletion and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 138 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 237 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 197 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more related to TCO. At TCO, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\n\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2024, lower natural gas prices in North America were primarily responsible for the negative impact to the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in a proved reserve decrease of approximately 58 million BOE. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes are discussed in the appropriate reserves sections herein. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 28 percent and 35 percent.",

      "answer": "Chevron's ROCE decreased from 11.9% in 2023 to 10.1% in 2024. This decline was primarily driven by both a drop in Net Income after adjustments (from $21,843 million in 2023 to $18,288 million in 2024) and a slight decrease in Average Capital Employed (from $183,173 million in 2023 to $180,232 million in 2024).

      "answer": "In 2023, XOM reported asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, which contributed to a $2,301 million loss in Identified Items, mainly due to the impairment of idled assets in California. In 2024, the company recorded a gain on the sale of assets of $415 million, which positively contributed to the Identified Items line that year, resulting in a net $216 million gain overall. This shift from a loss to a gain indicates that XOM's divestment strategy evolved from one focused on exiting underperforming or idled assets (which required impairments) to a more opportunistic approach where asset sales generated positive returns. The change in the relationship between Asset Sales and Identified Items\u2014from a negative to a positive financial impact\u2014suggests a strategic pivot in how XOM is managing its portfolio, with 2024 reflecting more favorable asset monetization outcomes.",

      "answer": "In 2023, COP benefited from lower taxes other than income taxes in the Alaska segment due to lower realized crude oil prices, which positively impacted earnings by $1,778 million. Despite this tax relief, COP recorded a $31 million before-tax expense for the Bear-1 dry hole in Alaska during 2023. In 2024, however, COP did not increase exploration activity in Alaska; instead, it focused exploration efforts in the Europe, Middle East, and North Africa segment, where it recorded $40 million in dry hole expenses, compared to $0 in Alaska. This suggests that the 2023 tax benefits in Alaska did not lead to increased regional exploration investment in 2024, possibly due to the prior year's unsuccessful exploration outcome and strategic resource allocation decisions.",

As part of this plan, $274 million in restructuring charges were allocated specifically to the All Other segment.

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "answer": "The increase in COP's interest and debt expense from $933 million in 2023 to $1,031 million in 2024 likely reduced their interest coverage ratio, as this financial metric is calculated using income before tax plus interest and debt expense. A higher interest and debt expense means the denominator in the interest coverage ratio has increased, which would lower the ratio if income before tax remained constant or did not increase proportionally.

      "answer": "In 2022, ExxonMobil's natural gas production was reported at 8.5 billion cubic feet per day, with divestments cited as a partial offset to production growth, reflecting a reactive approach tied to market conditions and operational adjustments. By 2023, divestments were explicitly described as a strategic tool involving commercial arrangements to reduce equity in assets for financial or economic consideration, indicating a more deliberate capital reallocation strategy. This shift shows that divestments in 2023 were more closely tied to ExxonMobil's proactive capital management goals, rather than just offsetting production declines or responding to external factors like demand fluctuations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

      "answer": "In 2022, XOM's natural gas production was reported at 8.5 billion cubic feet per day, with divestments noted as a partial offset to production growth. By 2024, divestments had a more pronounced impact, directly contributing to a $560 million decrease in earnings due to lower base volumes, which were attributed to higher planned maintenance and divestments.

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

      "answer": "In 2022, COP recorded a before-tax impairment of $828 million for the Alaska North Slope Gas Asset, signaling the abandonment of the project and removal from development plans. This decision directly reduced exploration expenses in subsequent years by eliminating ongoing appraisal and development costs, as noted in the 2021 analysis which showed a decline in exploration expenses due to the absence of similar impairments and dry hole costs. By 2024, COP's total exploration expenses across all consolidated operations had dropped to $356 million, a significant decrease from earlier years impacted by such asset write-offs. This reflects a strategic shift toward more economically viable projects and a more disciplined approach to exploration spending.",

This reflects a decreasing trend in the estimated Other Benefits liability, suggesting a continued reduction in future benefit obligations.

      "answer": "In 2022, COP applied an assumed rate of compensation increase of 3.17% for international pension benefits, which increased to 4.05% by 2024. This upward adjustment in the assumed compensation growth rate would generally lead to higher projected benefit obligations, as future pension payouts are typically tied to salary levels at retirement. The increase in this assumption, combined with the rise in international pension obligations from $152 million in 2022 to $316 million in 2024, indicates that COP's actuarial models incorporated a more optimistic view of future salary growth, which directly influenced the valuation of these liabilities. The UPS 2022 filing provides context on how companies in general apply compensation increase rates in pension valuations, showing that this metric is a standard input in actuarial calculations for international pension benefits.",

      "answer": "In 2023, ConocoPhillips reported that development drilling contributed 161 million barrels and technical revisions added 31 million barrels to crude oil reserves in the Lower 48, partially offset by downward revisions due to lower prices and development plan changes. These revisions, along with extensions and discoveries, fed into the company's proved undeveloped reserves, which increased from 2,334 million barrels at the end of 2023 to 2,697 million barrels by the end of 2024. The 2024 increase was driven by revisions (+535 million barrels), purchases (+57 million), and extensions/discoveries (+281 million), indicating that prior-year reserve adjustments significantly contributed to the growth in undeveloped reserves.",

      "answer": "In 2022, XOM's volume growth positively impacted adjusted earnings by $100 million, driven by higher sales and invested assets in Latin America. However, by 2023, despite maintaining focus on volume growth as a strategic lever, the company reported a significant drop in adjusted earnings\u2014from $59.1 billion to $38.6 billion\u2014a $20.5 billion decline. This evolution suggests that other factors, such as foreign currency fluctuations, lower commodity prices, and reduced market demand, had a much stronger negative impact, overwhelming the benefits from volume growth. Thus, while volume growth remained a contributor, its influence was materially diminished in the context of broader financial headwinds in 2023.",

Similarly, emission-reduction roadmaps are dependent on future market factors, such as continued technological progress and policy support, and also represent forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including future energy demand and mix; financial and operating performance; realized price and margins; dividends and shareholder  returns,  including  the  timing  and  amounts  of  share  repurchases;  volume  growth;  project  plans,  timing,  costs,  and capacities;  capital  expenditures,  including  lower-emissions  and  environmental  expenditures;  cost  reductions  and  structural  cost savings; integration benefits; emission intensity and absolute emissions reductions; achievement of ambitions to reach Scope 1 and Scope 2 net-zero from operated assets by 2050, to reduce methane emissions and flaring, or to complete major asset emission reduction  roadmaps;  implementation  and  outcomes  of  carbon  capture  and  storage  projects  and  infrastructure,  renewable  fuel projects,  blue  hydrogen  projects,  and  other  technology  efforts;  the  impact  of  new  technologies  on  society  and  industry;  capital expenditures  and  mix;  investment  returns;  accounting  and  financial  reporting  effects  resulting  from  market  or  regulatory developments and ExxonMobil's responsive actions, including potential impairment charges; and the outcome of litigation and tax contingencies,  could  differ  materially  due  to  a  number  of  factors.  These  include  global  or  regional  changes  in  the  supply  and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market or economic conditions that impact demand, prices and differentials; policy and consumer support for lower-emission products and technologies in different jurisdictions; the impact of company actions to protect the health and safety of employees, vendors, customers, and communities; actions of competitors and commercial counterparties; the ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; the severity, length and ultimate impact of COVID-19 variants and government responses on people and economies; reservoir performance; the outcome  of  exploration  projects  and  timely  completion  of  development  and  construction  projects;  regulatory  actions  targeting public companies in the oil and gas industry; changes in local, national, or international law, taxes, regulation or policies affecting our business, including environmental regulations and timely granting of governmental permits; war, trade agreements and patterns, shipping blockades or harassment, and other political or security disturbances; the pace of regional and global economic recovery from  the  pandemic  and  the  occurrence  and  severity  of  future  outbreaks;  opportunities  for  and  regulatory  approval  of  potential investments or divestments; the actions of competitors; the capture of efficiencies within and between business lines and the ability to  maintain  near-term  cost  reductions  as  ongoing  efficiencies  while  maintaining  future  competitive  positioning;  unforeseen technical or operating difficulties; the development and competitiveness of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies; the results of research programs; the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis; general economic conditions including the occurrence and duration of economic recessions; and other factors discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nEnergy demand models are forward-looking by nature and aim to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply ExxonMobil views  any  particular  scenario  as  likely  to  occur.  In  addition,  energy  demand  scenarios  require  assumptions  on  a  variety  of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For  example,  the  IEA  describes  its  NZE  scenario  as  extremely  challenging,  requiring  unprecedented  innovation,  unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use by ExxonMobil is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of  ExxonMobil's  separate  planning  process,  but  may  be  secondarily  tested  for  robustness  or  resiliency  against  different assumptions, including against various scenarios. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for,  and  production  of,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  manufacture,  trade,  transport  and  sale  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. ExxonMobil's operating segments are Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical. Where  applicable  ExxonMobil  voluntarily  discloses  additional  U.S.,  Non-U.S.  and  regional  splits  to  help  investors  better understand the company's operations.\n\nIn  January 2022, the Corporation announced that effective April 2022 it is streamlining its business structure by combining the Chemical and Downstream businesses. The company will be organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions will consist of Energy Products, Specialty Products and Chemical Products. Low Carbon Solutions will continue to be included in Corporate and Financing. The businesses will  be  supported  by  a  combined  technology  organization,  and  other  centralized  service-delivery  groups,  building  on  the establishment of a worldwide major projects organization in 2019.",

      "answer": "In 2022, XOM noted that liquids production decreased by 60 thousand barrels per day, with divestments cited as a contributing factor alongside entitlements and decline. However, the treatment of divestments was relatively general and grouped with other production-reducing factors. By 2023, XOM provided a more formal and distinct characterization of divestments as a separate category in their production reconciliation, defining them as 'reductions in ExxonMobil\u2019s production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.' This shift indicates that divestments became a more deliberate and strategically framed component of production management in 2023, suggesting a more intentional use of asset sales as a tool to shape the company\u2019s upstream portfolio.",

      "question": "How did COP's reduction in dry hole expenses in 2022 influence their 2023 exploration spending strategy, and what does this reveal about their regional focus shifts following the Concho acquisition?",
      "answer": "In 2022, COP reported significantly lower dry hole expenses compared to 2020, specifically citing the absence of costs from the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia and reduced drilling setbacks in Alaska. This reduction directly contributed to an overall decrease in exploration expenses in 2022. By 2023, COP's exploration spending reallocated resources, with a total of $306 million in exploration expenses, including $268 million attributed to equity affiliates and a notable $51 million in the Asia Pacific/Middle East region. This suggests a strategic pivot toward international opportunities and affiliate partnerships post-Concho acquisition, leveraging cost savings from fewer dry holes to expand exploration in potentially more lucrative areas.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(2022) \u2192 Dry Hole Expenses: COP experienced reduced dry hole expenses in 2022, specifically noting the absence of costs from the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia and reduced drilling setbacks in Alaska.",
        "Hop 2: Dry Hole Expenses \u2192 Exploration Expenses: Lower dry hole expenses contributed to a broader decline in exploration expenses in 2022, as these costs are a component of overall exploration spending.",
        "Hop 3: Exploration Expenses \u2190 COP(2023): In 2023, COP's exploration expenses totaled $306 million, with $268 million attributed to equity affiliates and a regional allocation showing increased focus on Asia Pacific/Middle East at $51 million."

These derivative positions were settled entirely within the first quarter of 2021. See Note 12 .\n\n## Income Statement Analysis\n\nUnless otherwise indicated, all results in Income Statement Analysis are before-tax.\n\nSales and other operating revenues increased 144 percent in 2021, mainly due to higher realized commodity prices and higher sales volumes.\n\nEquity in earnings of affiliates increased  $400 million in 2021, primarily due to higher earnings driven by higher LNG and crude prices, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate related to equity method investments in our Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment .\n\nGain on dispositions decreased $63 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of a $587 million gain related to our 2020 Australia-West divestiture and a $179 million loss associated with the sale of noncore assets in our Other International segment.  The decreases were partially offset by $200 million related to a FID bonus associated with our Australia-West divestiture, gains recognized for contingent payments associated with previous dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments and gains on sales of certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment.\n\nOther income (loss) increased $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to a gain of $1,040 million on our CVE common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million loss on those shares in 2020. See Note 5 .\n\nPurchased commodities increased 125 percent in 2021, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes.\n\nProduction and operating expenses increased $1,350 million in 2021, primarily in line with higher production volumes.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $289 million in 2021, primarily due to transaction and restructuring expenses associated with our Concho acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs.\n\nExploration expenses decreased $1,113 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of 2020 expenses including an $828 million impairment for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset, the early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska, and absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses from 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia.  2021 also saw lower dry hole expenses in Alaska.\n\nImpairments decreased $139 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment in 2021.  For additional information, see Note 7 and Note 13 .\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $880 million in 2021, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher Lower 48 sales volumes.\n\nForeign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased $50 million in 2021 due to the absence of derivative gains and other remeasurements.\n\nSee Note 17-Income Taxes for information regardin g our income tax provision and effective tax rate.",

      "answer": "CVX's Interest Coverage Ratio decreased from 49.0 in 2023 to 36.5 in 2024. This decline was partly due to the increase in Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests, which subtracts from the numerator of the Interest Coverage Ratio. In 2023, this value was $42M, while in 2024 it rose to $88M. As a result, the larger deduction in 2024 reduced the overall subtotal used in the ratio, contributing to the lower Interest Coverage Ratio despite higher interest costs being managed.",

      "answer": "Chevron's interest coverage ratio calculation methodology showed increased specificity in 2024, explicitly including adjustments for interest and debt expense alongside income before tax. In 2023, Chevron reported an income before tax of $7,209 million, which served as the base for assessing debt servicing capability. In 2024, the methodology expanded to clarify that this income figure should be adjusted by adding interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest while subtracting net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, before dividing by before-tax interest costs. This evolution in explanation suggests a more detailed approach to understanding the company's ability to meet interest obligations, incorporating broader financial adjustments in the 2024 filing compared to the simpler reference to income before tax in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Chevron reported a 1.8 TCF increase in natural gas proved reserves in Asia, primarily attributed to strong performance at the Bibiyana and Jalalabad fields in Bangladesh. However, by 2024, while Chevron still held an interest in the Bibiyana field, there was no explicit mention of reserve growth from this region. Instead, the 2024 filing highlighted political unrest in Bangladesh as a risk factor, noting that while operations were not yet impacted, future effects on financial condition and results remained uncertain. This reflects a shift in focus from reserve growth to risk exposure in the region, suggesting Chevron may have adjusted its reserve classification or risk disclosures for Bibiyana to account for geopolitical instability, even though the field remains in active operation.",

Recent political unrest in the country has not impacted the company's operations to date; however, the future impacts, if any, on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nCommodity Prices The following chart shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $81 per barrel for the full-year 2024, compared to $83 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Brent price was $75 per barrel. The WTI price  averaged  $76  per  barrel  for  the  full-year  2024,  compared  to  $78  in  2023. As  of  mid-February  2025,  the  WTI  price  was  $71  per  barrel.  The  majority  of  the company's equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price averaged $2.25 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the full-year 2024, compared to $2.56 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Henry Hub price was $4.42 per MCF. See page 47 for the company's U.S. and international average realizations for each of the past three years.\n\nCrude prices in 2024 were influenced by geopolitical conflict and OPEC+ supply restraint, which was offset by factors such as non-OPEC supply growth and slowing demand growth.\n\nIn  contrast  to  price  movements  in  the  global  market  for  crude  oil,  prices  for  natural  gas  are  also  impacted  by  regional  supply  and  demand  and  infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, lower Henry Hub prices were driven by high storage levels, strong production, and delayed starts to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects.\n\nOutside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company's long-term contract prices for LNG  are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG  offtake from the operated Australian LNG  projects is committed under binding longterm contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market.\n\nProduction The company's worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2024 was 3.3 million barrels per day, 7 percent higher than in 2023 primarily due to the full-year of legacy PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) production and growth in the Permian Basin. About 20 percent of the company's net oil-equivalent production in 2024 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the Republic of Congo.\n\nThe company estimates its net oil-equivalent production in 2025 to increase six to eight percent over 2024, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $70 per barrel and excluding expected asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greaterthan-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; acquisition and divestment of assets; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and  natural  gas  in  various  markets;  weather  conditions  that  may  shut  in  production;  civil  unrest;  changing  geopolitics;  delays  in  completion  of  maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations.

Specifically, Note 23 in the 2024 filing disclosed that $237 million in reclassified components\u2014including amortization of actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs\u2014were included in employee benefit costs. This indicates that the prior year's net charges were indirectly influenced by underlying employee benefit cost trends, which became more explicitly recognized in 2024.

Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\n\nIn fourth quarter 2024, the company announced plans to achieve $2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including expanded use of global capability centers. In relation to these efforts, the company recognized a restructuring charge of $715 million after tax in fourth quarter 2024, with associated cash outflows anticipated over the next two years. The company continues to evaluate incremental cost reduction opportunities and could incur additional restructuring and reorganization charges in future periods. This will have an impact on the company's pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB) plans; however, the impact is not yet estimable and any impacts will be recognized in future periods.\n\nEarnings trends for the company's major business areas are described as follows:\n\nUpstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. These prices are subject to external factors over  which  the  company  has  no  control,  including  product  demand  connected  with  global  economic  conditions,  industry  production  and  inventory  levels, technology  advancements,  production  quotas  or  other  actions  imposed  by  OPEC+  countries,  actions  of  regulators,  weather-related  damage  and  disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company's control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company's production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\n\nThe longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company's ability to efficiently find, acquire and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn April 2024, Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) achieved start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and at year-end 2024, all four pressure boost facility compressors are online and all metering stations have been converted to low pressure. In January 2025, TCO started oil production at its Future G rowth Project, which is ex pected to contribute to higher free cash flow.\n\nChevron has interests in V enezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in V enezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received G eneral License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in V enezuela subject to certain limitations, and the company continues such activities under this G eneral License. The financial results for Chevron's business in V enezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company's results. Crude oil liftings in V enezuela started in first quarter 2023, which have positively impacted the company's results. The company's independent affiliates have continued to maintain safe and reliable operations; however, future impact on results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nChevron maintains an equity interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) which provides a primary export route for Tengiz field production in Kazakhstan. An adverse  event  or  incident  affecting  CPC  operations,  which  CPC  has  ex perienced  from  time  to  time,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Tengiz  field  and  the company's results of operations and financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions and the February 2025 drone attack on the CPC pumping station, remain uncertain.\n\nOther governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or ex port crude in the region around Russia.\n\nChevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar field in Israel. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and various regional adversaries, the company continues to maintain safe and reliable operations while meeting its contractual commitments. The company continues to monitor the ongoing conflict in the region and any future impacts on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.",

      "question": "How did the change in COP's assumed rate of compensation increase from 2022 to 2024 affect the net periodic pension cost for U.S. benefits, given the relationship between compensation assumptions and pension cost drivers?",
      "answer": "COP's assumed rate of compensation increase for U.S. pension benefits was 4.00% in 2022 (COP_10k_2022.pdf) and remained constant in 2024 filings (COP_10k_2024.pdf), despite a decrease in net periodic pension cost from $131M in 2022 to $75M in 2024. The compensation increase assumption directly influences the service cost component of pension expenses, as higher assumed compensation growth leads to higher future benefit obligations. While the compensation assumption remained flat, other factors such as improved returns on plan assets ($-50M in 2022 vs. $-66M in 2024) and amortization of prior service credits contributed to the reduced net periodic cost.",

      "answer": "COP's assumed rate of compensation increase for U.S. pension benefits rose from 4.29% in 2022 (based on prior year assumptions) to 5.00% in 2024, which would typically suggest increasing future pension obligations. However, the company's actual U.S. pension liabilities declined significantly from $369 million in 2022 to $176 million in 2024. This inverse relationship indicates that other factors, such as pension plan asset performance, changes in discount rates (which rose from 3.13% to 5.70%), or benefit plan modifications, had a stronger influence than the increase in assumed compensation growth. This dynamic highlights how actuarial assumptions like compensation increases are just one component in determining pension liabilities, with market-driven assumptions like discount rates playing a dominant role in reported obligations.",
