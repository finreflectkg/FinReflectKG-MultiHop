      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart had $10.6 billion remaining under its repurchase program by the end of January 2022. By fiscal 2023, this figure had increased to $16.5 billion as of January 2024, indicating a significant boost in repurchase capacity. In fiscal 2024, the remaining value had decreased to $12.0 billion as of January 2025. This pattern suggests an initial aggressive capital return strategy in 2023, followed by a more measured approach in 2024.",

In 2023, the definition remained consistent, emphasizing digital initiation and store fulfillment as the core of omni-channel activity. By 2024, the scope expanded to include additional components of the company's ecosystem such as advertising arrangements, fulfillment services, and data insights as part of the omni-channel sales definition. This evolution indicates a strategic shift toward integrating a wider range of digital and service-based offerings into the core omni-channel experience, reflecting Walmart's deepening focus on digital commerce and ecosystem monetization.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's reliance on its current cash position to meet contractual obligations evolve from 2022 through 2024, given the disclosed changes in purchase obligations and capital expenditure commitments across those years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Walmart disclosed $27.9 billion in unrecorded purchase obligations, with $9.3 billion due within one year, and explicitly stated that its current cash position, along with cash flows from operations and access to capital markets, would be sufficient to meet these obligations. In 2023, the company reiterated this position, emphasizing that purchase obligations remained a key component of liquidity planning, though no updated dollar figures were provided. By 2024, Walmart continued to assert that its current cash position and cash flows would be adequate to fund operations and global investments, but the forward-looking statements now included heightened sensitivity to macroeconomic factors like inflation and supply chain disruptions, suggesting a more cautious stance on liquidity risk. This indicates a consistent reliance on cash reserves but with increasing acknowledgment of external pressures over time.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Material Cash Requirements\n\nMaterial cash requirements from operating activities primarily consist of inventory purchases, employee related costs, taxes, interest and other general operating expenses, which we expect to be primarily satisfied by our cash from operations. Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.\n\nAs of January 31, 2022, the Company has $27.9 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $9.3 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.\n\nWe have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2022, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:",

      "question": "How did PEP's approach to brand development spending evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its indefinite-lived brand strategy and macroeconomic challenges such as inflation, geopolitical instability, and the lingering effects of the pandemic?",
      "answer": "PEP consistently expensed brand development costs as incurred across all three years. In 2022, the company tied brand life assessments to factors like market share and macroeconomic conditions, including the impact of the pandemic. By 2023, PEP maintained the same expense policy but began factoring in a high interest rate and inflationary cost environment when evaluating brand fair values. In 2024, the company expanded its indefinite-lived brand criteria to include ongoing support through marketplace spending, while also incorporating volatile geopolitical conditions into its fair value estimates. This shows a strategic evolution toward emphasizing long-term brand support amid increasingly complex macroeconomic pressures.",

In addition, DSD products are placed  on  the  shelf  by  our  employees  with  customer  shelf  space  and  storerooms  limiting  the  quantity  of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.\n\nAs  discussed  in  'Our  Customers'  in  'Item  1.

Total  marketplace  spending  includes  sales  incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\n\nA  number  of  our  sales  incentives,  such  as  bottler  funding  to  independent  bottlers  and  customer  volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for  the  expected  payout,  which  may  occur  after  year  end  once  reconciled  and  settled.

      "answer": "PepsiCo's reported tax rate increased by 0.9 percentage points in 2022, primarily due to adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to the final IRS audit assessment for 2014\u20132016. In 2023, the tax rate increased further by 3.7 percentage points, driven by a prior-year adjustment to reserves for uncertain tax positions following an agreement with the IRS to settle one issue from the 2014\u20132016 audit, as well as the impact of the Juice Transaction. By 2024, the rate decreased slightly by 0.4 percentage points, mainly due to a reduction in the state tax rate. This 3-year progression shows a net increase in the reported tax rate, influenced by ongoing tax position settlements and regulatory outcomes.",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Costco consistently noted that its paid membership growth rate was adversely impacted when warehouse openings occurred in existing markets, as opposed to new markets. In 2022, the company observed that this headwind was 'continuing to decline in significance' relative to total operations, suggesting early signs of stabilization. In 2023, Costco reiterated that membership format is 'integral' to profitability and that growth in the membership base and renewal rates materially influence results. In 2024, the same language persisted, indicating that despite ongoing expansion, the company had not yet fully overcome the negative impact of market cannibalization on membership growth. This 3-year consistency reveals that while Costco's membership model remains strong, its growth faces persistent pressure from internal expansion dynamics, particularly in mature markets.",

However, SKU availability in the core warehouse business remained stable at less than 4,000 active SKUs per warehouse in both 2022 and 2024, indicating a continued focus on streamlined inventory. Online SKUs fluctuated slightly, with 10,000 to 11,000 in 2022, and 9,000 to 10,000 in 2024, suggesting a strategic adjustment in digital offerings.

Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inv entory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believ e our inv entory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur warehouses on average operate on a sev en-day, 70-hour week. Gasoline operations generally hav e extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, we believ e labor costs are lower relativ e to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks abov e the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with v ariations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executiv e member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary stored-v alue card (shop card).\n\nOur strategy is to prov ide our members with a broad range of high-quality merchandise at prices we believ e are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors.

      "question": "How has Costco's strategic emphasis on its food court operations evolved from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its integration within the warehouse model and its role in driving member engagement?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Costco consistently included the food court as part of its warehouse ancillary businesses, highlighting its role in encouraging more frequent member shopping. In 2022, the food court was listed among other ancillary services like gasoline and pharmacy, indicating its foundational role. In 2023, Costco reiterated the food court's presence, reinforcing its alignment with the warehouse model's efficiency and member-focused strategy. By 2024, despite no explicit change in description, the continued inclusion of the food court within warehouse ancillary operations signals sustained strategic importance, especially as Costco emphasized services that drive member satisfaction and repeat visits. The lack of explicit quantitative metrics around food court sales suggests it serves more as a member engagement tool than a primary profit center, remaining stable in its strategic positioning over the three-year period.",

This represents a 4.7% increase from 2022 to 2024. The slight dip in 2023 suggests temporary market or supply chain pressures, but the rebound and stronger growth in 2024 indicate a renewed strategic emphasis on expanding non-food offerings such as electronics, home goods, and seasonal merchandise.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PEP consistently expensed brand development costs as incurred and evaluated indefinite-lived brands based on revenue and cash flow performance, along with the company's intent to support brands through marketplace spending. In 2022, factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic were central to brand valuation assumptions. By 2023, PEP incorporated ongoing geopolitical conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, as well as a high interest rate and inflationary environment, into its fair value estimates. In 2024, the company continued to emphasize macroeconomic conditions, particularly volatile geopolitical situations and sustained inflationary pressures, in both qualitative and quantitative impairment assessments. This shows a consistent framework applied with evolving external risk considerations over time.",

In  fact,  our  commitment  to  freshness  and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed  on  the  shelf  by  our  employees  with  customer  shelf  space  and  storerooms  limiting  the  quantity  of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.\n\nAs  discussed  in  'Our  Customers'  in  'Item  1.  Business,'  we  offer  sales  incentives  and  discounts  through various  programs  to  customers  and  consumers.  Total  marketplace  spending  includes  sales  incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\n\nA  number  of  our  sales  incentives,  such  as  bottler  funding  to  independent  bottlers  and  customer  volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for  the  expected  payout,  which  may  occur  after  year  end  once  reconciled  and  settled.  These  accruals  are based  on  contract  terms  and  our  historical  experience  with  similar  programs  and  require  management judgment  with respect to estimating customer and consumer  participation and performance  levels. Differences  between  estimated  expense  and  actual  incentive  costs  are  normally  insignificant  and  are recognized  in  earnings  in  the  period  such  differences  are  determined.  In  addition,  certain  advertising  and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\n\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nWe sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  We  also  purchase  brands  and  other  intangible  assets  in  acquisitions.  In  a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and  other  intangible  assets,  based  on  estimated  fair  values,  with  any  excess  recorded  as  goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the COVID19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles,  market  share,  consumer  awareness,  brand  history  and  future  expansion  expectations,  amount  and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.\n\nWe believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If  these  indefinite-lived  brand  criteria  are  not  met,  brands  are  amortized  over  their  expected  useful  lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand  history,  future  expansion  expectations  and  regulatory  restrictions,  as  well  as  the  macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.\n\nIn connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories.

      "answer": "PepsiCo's reported tax rate increased by 0.9 percentage points in 2022 due to the net tax impact of adjustments to uncertain tax positions from the IRS audit for 2014\u20132016. In 2023, the tax rate rose further by 3.7 percentage points, primarily due to a prior-year adjustment to reserves for uncertain tax positions following an agreement with the IRS on one issue from the same audit period, as well as the impact of the Juice Transaction. In 2024, the reported tax rate reversed slightly with a 0.4 percentage point decrease, mainly due to a reduction in the state tax rate. This 3-year trajectory reveals a volatile tax position influenced heavily by legacy audit settlements and regulatory adjustments.",

See  Note  1  to  our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\nOther  pension  and  retiree  medical  benefits  income  increased  $405  million,  primarily  reflecting  lower settlement charges in 2021, the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of plan changes approved  in  2020,  as  discussed  in  Note  7  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements,  and  the  impact  of discretionary plan contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.\n\nNet interest expense and other increased $735 million, reflecting a charge of $842 million in connection with our  cash  tender  offers.  See  Note  8  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information.  This impact was partially offset by lower interest rates on average debt balances.\n\nThe reported tax rate increased 0.9 percentage points, primarily reflecting the net tax impact of adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to the final assessment from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nCertain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.

Examples of items for which we may make adjustments include: amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses (non-cash); charges related to restructuring plans; costs associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures  and  other  structural  changes;  gains  associated  with  divestitures;  pension  and  retiree  medicalrelated amounts (including all settlement and curtailment gains and losses); charges or",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's net pension and retiree medical adjustments fluctuated significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the adjustment was $770 million, declined to $389 million in 2023, and then dropped to just $5 million in 2024. This sharp decline indicates a substantial reduction in the volatility or recognition of pension and retiree medical liabilities over the three-year period, suggesting potential stabilization or restructuring of long-term employee benefit obligations, which could signal improved financial predictability for the company.",

In 2024, PEP continued to reference the inflationary cost environment and geopolitical volatility as key assumptions in brand valuations, while also refining its qualitative and quantitative impairment testing methodology for indefinite-lived intangible assets.

In  fact,  our  commitment  to  freshness  and product dating serves to regulate the quantity of product shipped or delivered. In addition, DSD products are placed  on  the  shelf  by  our  employees  with  customer  shelf  space  and  storerooms  limiting  the  quantity  of product. For product delivered through other distribution networks, we monitor customer inventory levels.\n\nAs  discussed  in  'Our  Customers'  in  'Item  1.  Business,'  we  offer  sales  incentives  and  discounts  through various  programs  to  customers  and  consumers.  Total  marketplace  spending  includes  sales  incentives, discounts, advertising and other marketing activities. Sales incentives and discounts are primarily accounted for as a reduction of revenue and include payments to customers for performing activities on our behalf, such as payments for in-store displays, payments to gain distribution of new products, payments for shelf space and discounts to promote lower retail prices. Sales incentives and discounts also include support provided to our independent bottlers through funding of advertising and other marketing activities.\n\nA  number  of  our  sales  incentives,  such  as  bottler  funding  to  independent  bottlers  and  customer  volume rebates, are based on annual targets, and accruals are established during the year, as products are delivered, for  the  expected  payout,  which  may  occur  after  year  end  once  reconciled  and  settled.  These  accruals  are based  on  contract  terms  and  our  historical  experience  with  similar  programs  and  require  management judgment  with respect to estimating customer and consumer  participation and performance  levels. Differences  between  estimated  expense  and  actual  incentive  costs  are  normally  insignificant  and  are recognized  in  earnings  in  the  period  such  differences  are  determined.  In  addition,  certain  advertising  and marketing costs are also based on annual targets and recognized during the year as incurred.\n\nSee Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition and related policies, including total marketplace spending.\n\n## Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n\nWe sell products under a number of brand names, many of which were developed by us. Brand development costs  are  expensed  as  incurred.  We  also  purchase  brands  and  other  intangible  assets  in  acquisitions.  In  a business combination, the consideration is first assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities, including brands and  other  intangible  assets,  based  on  estimated  fair  values,  with  any  excess  recorded  as  goodwill. Determining fair value requires significant estimates and assumptions, including those related to the COVID19 pandemic, based on an evaluation of a number of factors, such as marketplace participants, product life cycles,  market  share,  consumer  awareness,  brand  history  and  future  expansion  expectations,  amount  and timing of future cash flows and the discount rate applied to the cash flows.\n\nWe believe that a brand has an indefinite life if it has a history of strong revenue and cash flow performance and we have the intent and ability to support the brand with marketplace spending for the foreseeable future. If  these  indefinite-lived  brand  criteria  are  not  met,  brands  are  amortized  over  their  expected  useful  lives, which generally range from 20 to 40 years. Determining the expected life of a brand requires management judgment and is based on an evaluation of a number of factors, including market share, consumer awareness, brand  history,  future  expansion  expectations  and  regulatory  restrictions,  as  well  as  the  macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brand is sold.\n\nIn connection with previous acquisitions, we reacquired certain franchise rights which provided the exclusive and perpetual rights to manufacture and/or distribute beverages for sale in specified territories.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PepsiCo's Net Currency Translation Adjustment fluctuated significantly, moving from a loss of $369 million in 2022, to a larger loss of $643 million in 2023, and then to a substantial loss of $1,962 million in 2024. This trajectory reveals increasing foreign exchange volatility exposure, particularly in 2024, which meaningfully reduced Comprehensive Income in that year to $7,548 million, down from $8,923 million in 2023.

See  Note  1  to  our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\nOther  pension  and  retiree  medical  benefits  income  increased  $405  million,  primarily  reflecting  lower settlement charges in 2021, the recognition of fixed income gains on plan assets, the impact of plan changes approved  in  2020,  as  discussed  in  Note  7  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements,  and  the  impact  of discretionary plan contributions, partially offset by a decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets.\n\nNet interest expense and other increased $735 million, reflecting a charge of $842 million in connection with our  cash  tender  offers.  See  Note  8  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  further  information.  This impact was partially offset by lower interest rates on average debt balances.\n\nThe reported tax rate increased 0.9 percentage points, primarily reflecting the net tax impact of adjustments to uncertain tax positions related to the final assessment from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) audit for the tax years 2014 through 2016.\n\n## Non-GAAP Measures\n\nCertain financial measures contained in this Form 10-K adjust for the impact of specified items and are not in accordance  with  U.S.  GAAP.

      "answer": "PepsiCo's net pension and retiree medical adjustments were $389 million in 2022, declined to -$358 million in 2023 (a negative value indicating a loss), and then dropped further to just $5 million in 2024. This represents a sharp downward trend, transitioning from a positive adjustment in 2022 to a significant negative adjustment in 2023, followed by near neutrality in 2024. The volatility suggests that the company experienced a major shift in its pension and retiree medical obligations, likely due to changes in actuarial assumptions, market performance of pension assets, or strategic decisions to address long-term liabilities. The 2023 reversal indicates a material increase in expected future obligations or a decline in asset values, while the 2024 near-zero adjustment suggests either stabilization or a strategic accounting change.",

      "answer": "Altria's net earnings attributable to equity investments increased from $5,838 million in 2022 to $6,284 million in 2023, and further to $6,501 million in 2024. This steady growth indicates a strengthening performance from its equity investments, suggesting improved profitability from these partnerships and a potentially successful long-term investment strategy. The narrowing losses from 'Other Investments' over the years\u2014from $520 million in 2022 to $108 million in 2023 and $47 million in 2024\u2014further support a trend of improved investment outcomes.",

      "question": "How did Altria's target positioning of total compensation packages relative to peer companies evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year progression suggest about its talent retention strategy in the context of declining social acceptance of tobacco?",
      "answer": "Altria consistently targeted total compensation packages above peer companies to counteract talent attraction and retention challenges linked to declining social acceptance of tobacco. In 2022, the company aimed to provide compensation between the 50th and 75th percentiles of peer levels. By 2023, it emphasized targeting compensation 'above peer companies,' with actual compensation potentially exceeding the 75th percentile depending on performance. In 2024, this positioning remained consistent, with no shift in percentile targets, but the company expanded benefits like family creation assistance and student loan support to enhance overall package competitiveness. This evolution suggests a strategic emphasis on strengthening non-salary components to retain talent despite industry stigma.",

Attracting, developing, retaining and deploying the best talent with the skills to make significant progress toward our Vision is a key business priority. Moreover, we recognize the importance of doing business the right way. We believe culture influences employee actions and decision making. This is why we dedicate resources to promoting a vibrant, inclusive workplace; attracting, developing, retaining and deploying talented employees to build a high-performing and diverse talent pipeline; promoting a culture of compliance and integrity; creating a safe workplace; and rewarding and recognizing employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them.\n\n## Oversight and Management\n\nOur Human Resources department is responsible for managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding, compensation and benefits design and implementation, performance management, career management and succession planning and professional and learning development. Our inclusion, diversity and equity efforts are managed by our Corporate Citizenship department. Our Board of Directors ('Board of Directors' or 'Board') and the Compensation and Talent Development Committee provide oversight of human capital matters, including reviewing initiatives and programs related to corporate culture and enterprise-wide talent development.\n\n'Supporting our People and our Communities' is one of our Responsibility Focus Areas, which includes two goals related to developing a high-performing and diverse talent pipeline: (i) enhance the diversity of our organization and leadership teams while building an inclusive and equitable culture; and (ii) build employee capability and well-being to succeed in uncertain and rapidly changing environments.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent. However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent with skills necessary for us to achieve our Vision. We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies with which we compete for talent. Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements - base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits.\n\nWe are committed to pay equity across our companies. Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in 2024, for employees performing the same or similar duties regardless of any differentiating factors, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 98.2% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our employees of color were 98.2% of those of our white employees. If we adjust for differentiating factors that legitimately influence pay, salaries of our female employees were 99.8% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our employees of color were 99.9% of those of our white employees.\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance. We also offer up to 12 weeks paid family leave to bond with a newborn child, the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for a family member who has a serious health condition. Our benefits also include physical, emotional and financial wellness programs and family creation assistance benefits, such as reimbursement of surrogacy, adoption assistance and doula expenses. While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees.\n\nWe are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through a tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees. We also provide eligible employees with a company-funded contribution applied to the employee's qualified higher education student loans to help reduce student loan debt.\n\n## Attracting, Developing, Retaining and Deploying Talent\n\nWe are focused on identifying the most qualified talent and investing in leader and employee development to build a diverse talent pipeline prepared and willing to lead at every level. Additionally, we are dedicated to being an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of personal background or work function. We recognize the critical importance of these efforts toward pursuing our Vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad and diverse spectrum of backgrounds, skills, experiences and cultures.\n\nOur salaried entry-level recruitment efforts focus on building relationships with university students, internship opportunities and partnerships with organizations that support a broad range of students. We complement these recruiting efforts with hiring experienced employees with demonstrated skills and/or leadership capabilities.\n\nTo help our employees succeed in their roles and develop in their careers, we emphasize ongoing training and leadership development opportunities. Building skills that drive innovation and aligning our employees to our Vision is important for our long-term success. The Human Resources department leads our learning and development efforts partnering with learning professionals embedded in functions throughout our operating and services companies. Employees have access to a wide variety of development programs, including new employee onboarding, in-person, virtual and self-guided training programs, technical training, including training to maintain professional certifications, and our educational refund program for continuing education.",

Our inclusion, diversity and equity ('ID&amp;E') programs are managed by our Corporate Citizenship department. Our Board of Directors ('Board of Directors' or 'Board') and the Compensation and Talent Development Committee provide oversight of human capital matters, including reviewing initiatives and programs related to corporate culture and enterprise-wide talent development, including our ID&amp;E initiatives.\n\n## Inclusion, Diversity and Equity\n\nWe recognize the critical importance of ID&amp;E in pursuing our Vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. In 2020, we established the following aspirational Inclusion &amp; Diversity Aiming Points to help guide our efforts:\n\n- Be an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of level, demographic group or work function.\n- Have equal numbers of men and women among our vice president and director-level employees.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are Asian, Black, Hispanic or two or more races to at least 30%.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are LGBTQ+, a person with a disability or a veteran.\n- Have diverse functional leadership teams that reflect the organizations they lead.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, women represented 32% of vice president-level and 41% of director-level roles; Asian, Black, Hispanic or employees of two or more races represented 24% of our vice president-level and 26% of our director-level roles.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent. However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent. We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies for which we compete for talent. Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements - base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits. Our goal is to provide total compensation packages between the 50th and 75th percentiles of total compensation packages paid to employees in comparable positions at our peer companies upon attainment of business and individual goals.\n\nWe are committed to pay equity across our companies. Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in November 2021, adjusting for factors generally considered to be legitimate differentiators of salary, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 99.6% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our non-white employees were 99.9% of those of our white employees.\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance, and up to 12 weeks paid parental and family leave for birth, adoption and foster placement and an additional six weeks paid leave for birth mothers. Our benefits also include mental health and wellness benefits and family creation assistance benefits, such as adoption assistance and coverage for fertility treatments. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for 2020 and 2021, we expanded dependent care coverage to include $5,000 employee reimbursement for remote learning and other dependent care costs. In addition, we offered financial incentives to our employees to encourage vaccination against COVID-19. While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees.\n\nWe are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through an unlimited tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees.",

      "answer": "Altria's reported OCI showed significant volatility from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, reported OCI decreased by $59 million (3.4%) due to higher costs, including acquisition-related costs and the impact of the pandemic, as well as volume/mix effects from a shift between MST and on! shipment volumes. In 2023, reported OCI rebounded with an increase of $90 million (5.5%), driven primarily by higher pricing and lower costs, despite headwinds from lower shipment volume and a higher percentage of on! shipment volume relative to MST. However, in 2024, reported OCI sharply declined by $273 million (15.9%), largely due to a non-cash impairment of the Skoal trademark ($354 million), lower shipment volume, and volume/mix effects, despite continued pricing gains.

Meanwhile, the weighted-average grant date fair value per PSU fluctuated: $46.58 in 2021 (2022 filing), $49.22 in 2023, and $46.87 in 2024, showing a slight decline from 2023 to 2024 but still above the 2022 level.

      "question": "How did the fair value of PMI's equity stakes in IPM India-related entities evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression indicate about PMI's strategic positioning in the South & Southeast Asia region?",
      "answer": "The fair value of PMI's equity stakes in entities related to IPM India increased from $326 million in 2022, to $375 million in 2023, and then sharply rose to $921 million in 2024. This represents a 183% increase from 2022 to 2024, indicating a significant strategic emphasis on the South & Southeast Asia region, particularly through its stake in IPM India and its partnership with Godfrey Phillips India Ltd (GPI). The substantial unrealized pre-tax gains in 2024 ($546 million) versus earlier years ($49 million in 2023 and presumably similar in 2022) also suggest a strong revaluation of these investments, potentially reflecting improved market positioning, operational performance, or long-term growth expectations in the region.",

      "answer": "In 2022, lower cigarette volume (notably in the Czech Republic, France, and Germany) partially offset gains from higher heated tobacco unit (HTU) volume and favorable pricing. In 2023, cigarette volume declines continued to negatively affect net revenues, despite a 4.5% overall revenue increase, with HTU volume growth becoming a stronger offsetting factor. In 2024, the downward pressure from declining cigarette volume persisted, even as net revenues grew 7.9%, driven by favorable pricing and HTU volume gains. The consistent negative impact of cigarette volume across all three years indicates a sustained structural decline in traditional cigarette sales, underscoring PM's increasing reliance on smoke-free products like HTUs to maintain revenue growth.",

Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 7.1%, reflecting a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume and adverse cigarette mix.\n\nThe pricing variance for 2023 and 2024 was negatively impacted by the supplemental tax surcharge on heated tobacco products (\"HTPs\") in G ermany, which went into effect in 2022. On March 14, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") ruled that the G erman fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. On May 15, 2024, following the decision issued by CJEU, the Fiscal Court in Dusseldorf (the \"FCD\") also ruled that the German fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. The FCD admitted an appeal to the Federal Tax Court. On June 19, 2024,  PMI submitted an appeal. The negative impact will continue, at least until the appeal ruling on the legality of the surcharge is concluded.  PMI currently accounts for the surcharge as a reduction in net revenues, with amounts withdrawn before May 15, 2024, currently under a payment suspension. Despite this payment suspension and, in order to avoid the future addition of interest, PMI elected, on January 14, 2025, to pay the amount outstanding of EUR 721 million (approximately $751 million), excluding accrued interest. An unfavorable outcome to the appeal would negatively impact PMI's future cash provided by operating activities for the amounts of unpaid interest. A favorable outcome to the appeal would positively impact future PMI's operating results and future cash provided by operating activities for the amounts paid in January 2025.",

As of December 31, 2024, our smoke-free products were available for sale in 95 markets. With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro ,  the  world's  best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume. Marlboro is complemented in the premium-price category by Parliament . Our other leading international cigarette brands are Chesterfield, L&amp;M , and Philip Morris.

Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025.

          "chunk_text": "Shipments of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro , increased by 2.9% in 2021, and represented approximately 9.5% of the international cigarette market, excluding the PRC, in 2021, 9.5% in 2020, and 10.0% in 2019.\n\nTotal shipment volume of heated tobacco units reached 95.0 billion units in 2021, up from 76.1 billion units in 2020.\n\nWe have a market share of at least 15% in approximately 100 markets, including Algeria, Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, the Czech Republic, Egypt, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Israel, Italy, Japan, Kuwait, Mexico, the Netherlands, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey and Ukraine.\n\n## Distribution &amp; Sales\n\nOur main types of distribution and sales are tailored to the characteristics of each market and are often used simultaneously:\n\n- Direct sales and distribution, where we have set up our own distribution selling directly to the retailers;\n- Distribution through independent distributors that often distribute other fast-moving consumer goods and are responsible for distribution in a particular market;\n- Exclusive zonified distribution, where the distributors are dedicated to us in multicategory products distribution and assigned to exclusive territories within a market;\n- Distribution through national or regional wholesalers that then supply the retail trade;\n- Our own e-commerce infrastructure for product sales to trade partners and to consumers; and\n- Our own brand retail infrastructure for our RRP products and accessories for sales to consumers.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe are subject to highly competitive conditions in all aspects of our business. We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro , L&amp;M , Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield , which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand  umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\n\nThe  competitive  environment  and  our  competitive  position  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  weak  economic  conditions,  erosion  of consumer  confidence,  competitors'  introduction  of  lower-price  products  or  innovative  products,  higher  tobacco  product  taxes,  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products  and  restricts  adult  consumer  access  to  truthful  and  non-misleading  information  about  our  RRPs.  Competitors  in  our  industry include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and  local  tobacco  companies  and,  in  some  instances,  state-owned  tobacco  enterprises,  principally  in Algeria,  Egypt,  the  PRC,  Taiwan, Thailand  and  Vietnam.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative products  through  inappropriate  marketing  campaigns,  messaging  and  inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the  dissemination  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  information  about  our  RRPs,  all  of  which  could  have  a  mutual  adverse  effect  on  our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Procurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2021, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2021, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI's global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe  believe  that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  tobacco  leaf  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production requirements.",

      "question": "How did Philip Morris International's total shipment volume evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's market dynamics and strategic initiatives during this period?",
      "answer": "Philip Morris International's total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, decreased by 1.8% in 2022 to 142.2 billion units, increased by 1.0% in 2023 to 738.2 billion units, and further increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units. This trajectory shows a recovery and growth trend following the decline in 2022, with particular strength in heated tobacco units, which rose from 109.2 billion in 2022 to 125.3 billion in 2023 and 139.7 billion in 2024. The shift reflects the company's strategic focus on smoke-free products, such as IQOS and ZYN, and the integration of Swedish Match, which contributed to stronger performance in 2023 and 2024 despite challenges in traditional cigarette markets like the Philippines in 2022.",

With regard to nicotine pouches, we increased our presence to 37 markets.\n\nOur cigarettes are sold in approximately 170 markets, and in many of these markets they hold the number one or number two market share position. We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands.

Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').

      "question": "How did Procter & Gamble's ESOP debt service requirements interact with its other retiree benefit obligations from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's evolving funding strategy for postretirement benefits?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Procter & Gamble's ESOP debt service requirements were consistently netted against plan assets for other retiree benefits, indicating a structural linkage between the two. In 2022, the company noted adjustments in the self-insured U.S. retiree health care program due to the shift toward fully-insured Medicare Advantage Programs starting in January 2022, which likely affected the valuation of retiree benefit obligations. In 2023, the actuarial gain for other retiree benefits was primarily driven by increases in discount rates and a decrease in assumptions for medical claims costs, suggesting a more favorable outlook for funding. By 2024, the actuarial gain for other retiree benefits was again linked to updated assumptions and an increase in discount rates, with work experience playing a more prominent role. The consistent netting of ESOP debt service against plan assets indicates that the company maintained a stable structural approach to managing these obligations, while the actuarial gains across the three years suggest a generally improving funding environment due to higher discount rates and better-than-expected medical cost trends.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PG](2023) \u2192 ESOP Debt Service Requirements: ESOP debt service requirements were netted against plan assets for other retiree benefits, with actuarial gains in 2023 tied to higher discount rates and reduced medical claim cost assumptions.",
        "Hop 2: [PG](2024) \u2192 ESOP Debt Service Requirements: In 2024, the actuarial gain for other retiree benefits was again linked to updated assumptions and an increase in discount rates, showing continuity in the funding dynamics.",
        "Hop 3: [PG](2022) \u2192 ESOP Debt Service Requirements: In 2022, the company adjusted its U.S. retiree health care program to transition to fully-insured Medicare Advantage Programs, which affected the valuation of retiree benefits and interacted with ESOP debt service requirements."

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, P&G projected that pension payments beyond fiscal year 2025 were not determinable. By fiscal year 2023, the company extended this horizon, stating that payments beyond fiscal year 2027 were not determinable. In fiscal year 2024, the language remained consistent with 2023, maintaining that payments beyond 2027 could not be determined. This indicates that P&G's confidence in forecasting long-term pension obligations has remained limited, despite a two-year extension in the determinable projection window between 2022 and 2023.",

This trajectory shows a significant transformation from a large retiree benefit obligation in 2022 to a more balanced position by 2024, suggesting potential restructuring or adjustments in non-pension retiree benefits between 2022 and 2023 that eliminated the prior service cost, followed by continued positive adjustments in 2024.",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Procter & Gamble reported net amounts recognized in AOCI for pension benefits at $2,076 million. This decreased to $1,974 million in fiscal year 2023 and further declined to $1,398 million in fiscal year 2024. This represents a consistent downward trend in the company's net unrecognized pension gains or losses held in AOCI, suggesting a reduction in pension-related volatility and potentially improved alignment between pension assets and liabilities over the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did Procter & Gamble's pension plan asset values, specifically influenced by currency translation adjustments, evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, and what does this three-year progression indicate about the company's exposure to foreign exchange volatility in its retirement benefit planning?",
      "answer": "From FY2022 to FY2024, P&G's pension plan assets were significantly impacted by currency translation adjustments, showing a volatile pattern: in FY2022, the adjustment was -$1,268 million; in FY2023, it was +$310 million; and in FY2024, it was -$119 million. This indicates fluctuating exposure to foreign exchange risk, with FY2022 showing a sharp decline, followed by partial stabilization in FY2023, and continued negative impact in FY2024. The volatility suggests that currency movements remain a key uncertainty factor in the company's global pension strategy.",

        "Hop 1: PG(2023) \u2192 Plan Asset Translation: Currency translation adjustment was +$310 million in FY2023, indicating a positive impact on pension plan assets.",

        "Hop 3: PG(2022) \u2192 Plan Asset Translation: Currency translation adjustment was -$1,268 million in FY2022, reflecting a major negative impact on plan assets that year."

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mondel\u0113z International's acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments fluctuated significantly, indicating varying levels of M&A integration activity and financial impact. In 2022, the company reported a net cost of $40 million related to these adjustments. By 2023, this figure increased to $246 million, suggesting a more active or complex integration phase. However, in 2024, the costs surged dramatically to $315 million, showing a reversal from the prior year's improvement and signaling potentially new integration challenges or additional M&A activity. This volatile pattern reveals that the company experienced inconsistent integration costs over the three-year period, with a notable spike in 2024 that likely impacted operating income and required deeper financial scrutiny.",

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z International's equity method investment net earnings declined from $385 million in 2022 to $160 million in 2023, and further to $168 million in 2024. This downward trend indicates a weakening contribution from its partially-owned investees over the period, suggesting either underperformance by these entities or a strategic shift by Mondel\u0113z to reduce reliance on equity method investments.",

        "Hop 1: [MDLZ](2022) \u2192 [Equity Method Investment Net Earnings]: $385 million in 2022, indicating a strong contribution from investees.",

      "answer": "MDLZ's allowance for long-term receivables started at $10 million in 2022, increased to $15 million in 2023, and further rose to $16 million in 2024. This steady increase indicates a growing concern about credit risk exposure, particularly for long-term receivables, as the company consistently adjusted its provisioning strategy upward to account for expected credit losses. The trend reflects a cautious approach to credit risk management, with incremental provisions and adjustments for currency impacts across the three-year period.",

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z's acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments fluctuated significantly over the three-year period, indicating shifting integration dynamics. In 2022, the company reported a net cost of $40 million related to these adjustments. By 2023, this figure had increased to $0.14 per diluted EPS, translating to roughly $126 million based on Mondel\u0113z's diluted share count. However, in 2024, the company recorded a substantial reversal of $315 million, suggesting either resolution of prior uncertainties or a strategic shift in managing acquisition-related liabilities. This volatile pattern indicates that while integration efforts were costly and ongoing in 2022 and 2023, 2024 saw a reversal that may reflect improved integration outcomes or favorable adjustments in contingent liabilities.",

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z International's equity method investment net earnings declined from $385 million in 2022 to $160 million in 2023, before slightly recovering to $168 million in 2024. This downward trend indicates a significant reduction in the company's returns from its equity method investments, potentially signaling either strategic divestitures, underperformance in investee companies, or a shift in focus toward wholly-owned operations.",

        "Hop 1: MDLZ(2022) \u2192 Equity Method Investment Net Earnings: $385 million in 2022, showing a relatively strong contribution from joint ventures and associates.",
        "Hop 2: MDLZ(2023) \u2192 Equity Method Investment Net Earnings: Declined sharply to $160 million in 2023, indicating a material drop in earnings from these investments.",
        "Hop 3: MDLZ(2024) \u2192 Equity Method Investment Net Earnings: Slight increase to $168 million in 2024, suggesting stabilization but not a return to prior levels."

      "answer": "MDLZ's allowance for long-term receivables increased from $10 million in 2022 to $15 million in 2023, and further to $16 million in 2024. This steady increase indicates a growing provision for potential credit losses on long-term receivables, suggesting either an expansion in long-term credit sales or a perceived increase in credit risk. In 2022, the allowance was $10 million, showing a relatively conservative stance. By 2023, the allowance had risen to $15 million, driven by a $3 million provision and offset by write-offs of $0. In 2024, the allowance reached $16 million, despite a $2 million reduction in the provision and $5 million in write-offs, indicating that the company maintained a cautious approach to credit risk. The trend suggests a strategic shift toward more extended credit terms with customers, requiring increased reserves to cover potential defaults.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Walmart reported $10.6 billion in remaining share repurchase capacity as of January 31, 2022. By 2023, this figure stood at $16.5 billion as of January 31, 2024, indicating increased authorization or reduced spending. However, in 2024, the available capacity dropped to $12.0 billion as of January 31, 2025, suggesting more aggressive share buybacks during that period. This trend reflects a shifting emphasis in capital allocation, with Walmart initially maintaining significant repurchase capacity in 2023 before accelerating buybacks in 2024.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's reliance on its current cash position to meet material cash obligations evolve from fiscal years 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to its seasonal inventory buildups and capital expenditures?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, Walmart disclosed $27.9 billion in unrecorded purchase obligations, with $9.3 billion due within one year, emphasizing that its cash flows from operations and current cash position would be sufficient to meet these obligations, including seasonal inventory buildups and capital expenditures. In 2023, the company reiterated this confidence, stating that its current cash position, along with cash flows from operations and access to capital markets, would continue to be sufficient to fund seasonal inventory increases and capital investments. By 2024, Walmart continued to assert that its sources of liquidity\u2014including its current cash position\u2014were adequate to fund operations, global expansion, and shareholder returns, despite increasing investments in technology and supply chain infrastructure. This shows a consistent reliance on its cash position to support operational and strategic commitments over the three-year period.",

Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.\n\nAs of January 31, 2022, the Company has $27.9 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $9.3 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.\n\nWe have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2022, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:",

      "question": "How did Procter & Gamble's ESOP debt service requirements interact with its other retiree benefit obligations from 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's evolving approach to postretirement funding strategies?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Procter & Gamble consistently disclosed that ESOP debt service requirements were netted against plan assets for other retiree benefits, indicating a structural linkage between the two. In 2022, the company noted actuarial gains for other retiree benefits were driven by increases in discount rates, partially offset by unfavorable medical claim experience. By 2023, actuarial gains for other retiree benefits were attributed to higher discount rates and lower assumptions for medical claim costs, suggesting a more optimistic outlook on future liabilities. In 2024, the actuarial gains continued to be influenced by updated assumptions and work experience, along with a rise in discount rates, reinforcing a trend of strategic recalibration. This 3-year progression shows P&G actively adjusted assumptions and funding strategies in response to macroeconomic shifts, particularly in discount rate fluctuations and healthcare cost projections, while maintaining the structural integration of ESOP debt service with retiree benefit obligations.",

However, the company maintained that its cash flows were adequate to meet future statutory funding requirements, with the projected payments beyond fiscal years 2025 (2022), 2027 (2023), and 2027 (2024) deemed indeterminable.

(1)\n\nRepresents  future  pension  payments  to  comply  with  local  funding  requirements.  These  future  pension  payments  assume  the  Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2025 are not currently determinable. (2)\n\nPrimarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrangements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-or-pay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with expected usage. This includes  service  contracts  for  information  technology,  human  resources  management  and  facilities  management  activities  that  have  been outsourced. While the amounts listed represent contractual obligations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be  paid  if  the  underlying  contracts  were  canceled  prior  to  maturity.  In  such  cases,  we  generally  are  able  to  negotiate  new  contracts  or cancellation penalties, resulting in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase obligations that are not takeor-pay arrangements. Such contractual purchase obligations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating cash flow trends. We do not believe such purchase obligations will adversely affect our liquidity position. (3)\n\n## SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include  revenue  recognition,  income  taxes,  certain  employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting  policies,  and  others  set  forth  in  Note  1  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are  integral  to  understanding  the  results  of  operations  and financial condition of the Company.\n\nThe  Company  has  discussed  the selection of significant accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product  to  customers.  Those  sales  predominantly  contain  a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single  point  in  time  when  ownership,  risks  and  rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities  and  consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers.  Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale.  Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on  contractual  terms,  sales  volumes  and  historical  utilization and  redemption  rates.    The  actual  amounts  paid  may  be different from such estimates.  These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nOur  annual  tax  rate  is  determined  based  on  our  income, statutory tax rates and  the tax impacts  of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgements  and  assumptions  regarding  the  recoverability  of certain deferred tax balances, primarily net operating loss and other  carryforwards,  and  our  ability  to  uphold  certain  tax positions.\n\nRealization of net operating losses and other carryforwards is dependent  upon  generating  sufficient  taxable  income  in  the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods, which involves business plans, planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more  likely  than  not  that  our  deferred  tax  assets,  net  of valuation allowances, will be realized.\n\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we  may  take  tax  positions  that  management  believes  are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority.

          "chunk_text": "\nRepresents the U.S. federal tax  liability associated with the repatriation provisions of the U.S. Tax  Act. (1)\n\nRepresents future pension payments to comply with local funding requirements. These future pension payments assume the Company continues to meet its future statutory funding requirements. Considering  the current economic environment in which the Company operates, the Company believes its cash flows are adequate to meet the future statutory funding  requirements. The projected payments beyond fiscal year 2027 are not currently determinable. (2)\n\nPrimarily reflects future contractual payments under various take-or-pay arrang ements entered into as part of the normal course of business. Commitments made under take-orpay obligations represent minimum commitments with suppliers and are in line with ex pected usag e. This includes service contracts for information technolog y, human resources management and facilities manag ement activities that have been outsourced. W hile the amounts listed represent contractual oblig ations, we do not believe it is likely that the full contractual amount would be paid if the underlying  contracts were canceled prior to maturity. In such cases, we g enerally are able to neg otiate new contracts or cancellation penalties, resulting  in a reduced payment. The amounts do not include other contractual purchase oblig ations that are not take-or-pay arrang ements. S uch contractual purchase oblig ations are primarily purchase orders at fair value that are part of normal operations and are reflected in historical operating  cash flow trends. W e do not believe such purchase oblig ations will adversely affect our liquidity position. (3)\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, there are certain accounting policies that may require a choice between acceptable accounting methods or may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. These include revenue recognition, income taxes, certain employee benefits and goodwill and intangible assets. We believe these accounting policies, and others set forth in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, should be reviewed as they are integral to understanding the results of operations and financial condition of the Company.\n\nThe Company has discussed the selection of critical accounting policies and the effect of estimates with the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nOur revenue is primarily generated from the sale of finished product to customers. Those sales predominantly contain a single performance obligation and revenue is recognized at a single point in time when ownership, risks and rewards transfer, which can be on the date of shipment or the date of receipt by the customer. Trade promotions, consisting primarily of customer pricing allowances, in-store merchandising funds, advertising and other promotional activities and consumer coupons, are offered through various programs to customers and consumers. Sales are recorded net of trade promotion spending, which is recognized as incurred at the time of the sale. Amounts accrued for trade promotions at the end of a period require estimation, based on contractual terms, sales volumes and historical utilization and redemption rates. The actual amounts paid may be different from such estimates. These differences, which have historically not been significant, are recognized as a change in management estimate in a subsequent period.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax  purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Also inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments and assumptions",

      "question": "How did Procter & Gamble's treatment of Prior Service Cost/Credit - Current Year evolve across its pension and other retiree benefit plans from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year trajectory reveal about the company's long-term benefit obligation management strategy?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Procter & Gamble's Prior Service Cost/Credit - Current Year shifted significantly across its pension and other retiree benefit plans. In 2022, the company reported a Prior Service Credit of $34 million for pension benefits and a Prior Service Cost of $(586) million for other retiree benefits. By 2023, the pension-related Prior Service Credit dropped to $8 million, while the other retiree benefits showed a much smaller Prior Service Cost of $2 million. In 2024, the pension Prior Service Credit increased to $21 million, and the other retiree benefits remained neutral with only a $2 million credit. This trajectory suggests a strategic reduction in long-term retiree benefit liabilities, particularly in non-pension plans, while maintaining a more stable posture in pension-related service costs.",

      "question": "How did Procter & Gamble's funded status for pension benefits evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what role did currency translation and actuarial gains or losses play in shaping this multi-year trend?",
      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's funded status for pension benefits improved over the three-year period from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the funded status was a deficit of $2,435 million, which widened slightly to $2,125 million in 2023 before narrowing significantly to a deficit of $1,498 million in 2024. Currency translation had a volatile impact across the years: in 2022 it reduced plan assets by $1,268 million, in 2023 it added $310 million to plan assets, and in 2024 it reduced plan assets by $119 million. Net actuarial losses also fluctuated: $4,067 million loss in 2022, a $550 million loss in 2023, and a small $11 million loss in 2024. The decreasing magnitude of actuarial losses and the stabilization of currency effects contributed to the improving funded status trajectory.",

        "Hop 1: [PG](2022) \u2192 [Plan Asset Translation]: PG reported a pension benefit funded status deficit of $2,435 million, with currency translation reducing plan assets by $1,268 million and a significant net actuarial loss of $4,067 million.",
        "Hop 2: [PG](2023) \u2192 [Plan Asset Translation]: The funded status deficit increased slightly to $2,125 million, but currency translation contributed positively with a $310 million increase to plan assets, and net actuarial losses decreased to $550 million.",
        "Hop 3: [PG](2024) \u2192 [Plan Asset Translation]: The funded status improved to a $1,498 million deficit, with currency translation reducing assets by $119 million and net actuarial losses shrinking dramatically to just $11 million."

      "question": "How did Altria's approach to total compensation packages evolve from 2022 to 2024 in response to talent attraction challenges linked to declining social acceptance of tobacco, and what quantitative changes in pay equity metrics accompanied this evolution?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Altria consistently emphasized targeting total compensation packages above peer companies to counteract talent attraction and retention challenges due to declining social acceptance of tobacco. In 2022, Altria aimed for compensation between the 50th and 75th percentiles of peer companies, with adjusted pay equity at 99.6% for female and 99.9% for non-white employees. By 2023, Altria maintained the same compensation positioning but reported a slight decline in unadjusted pay equity (97.8% for females and 98.1% for employees of color), though adjusted figures remained stable. In 2024, Altria continued the same compensation strategy and saw slight improvements in unadjusted pay equity (98.2% for females and 98.2% for employees of color), with adjusted figures approaching parity (99.8% and 99.9%, respectively). This progression shows a consistent compensation strategy paired with gradual improvements in pay equity metrics over the three-year period.",

In 2020, we established the following aspirational Inclusion &amp; Diversity Aiming Points to help guide our efforts:\n\n- Be an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of level, demographic group or work function.\n- Have equal numbers of men and women among our vice president and director-level employees.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are Asian, Black, Hispanic or two or more races to at least 30%.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are LGBTQ+, a person with a disability or a veteran.\n- Have diverse functional leadership teams that reflect the organizations they lead.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, women represented 32% of vice president-level and 41% of director-level roles; Asian, Black, Hispanic or employees of two or more races represented 24% of our vice president-level and 26% of our director-level roles.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent. However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent. We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies for which we compete for talent. Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements - base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits. Our goal is to provide total compensation packages between the 50th and 75th percentiles of total compensation packages paid to employees in comparable positions at our peer companies upon attainment of business and individual goals.\n\nWe are committed to pay equity across our companies. Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in November 2021, adjusting for factors generally considered to be legitimate differentiators of salary, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 99.6% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our non-white employees were 99.9% of those of our white employees.\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance, and up to 12 weeks paid parental and family leave for birth, adoption and foster placement and an additional six weeks paid leave for birth mothers. Our benefits also include mental health and wellness benefits and family creation assistance benefits, such as adoption assistance and coverage for fertility treatments. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for 2020 and 2021, we expanded dependent care coverage to include $5,000 employee reimbursement for remote learning and other dependent care costs. In addition, we offered financial incentives to our employees to encourage vaccination against COVID-19. While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees.\n\nWe are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through an unlimited tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees.",

Attracting, developing, retaining and deploying the best talent with the skills to make significant progress toward our Vision is a key business priority. Moreover, we recognize the importance of doing business the right way. We believe culture influences employee actions and decision making. This is why we dedicate resources to promoting a vibrant, inclusive workplace; attracting, developing, retaining and deploying talented employees to build a high-performing and diverse talent pipeline; promoting a culture of compliance and integrity; creating a safe workplace; and rewarding and recognizing employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them.\n\n## Oversight and Management\n\nOur Human Resources department is responsible for managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding, compensation and benefits design and implementation, performance management, career management and succession planning and professional and learning development. Our inclusion, diversity and equity efforts are managed by our Corporate Citizenship department. Our Board of Directors ('Board of Directors' or 'Board') and the Compensation and Talent Development Committee provide oversight of human capital matters, including reviewing initiatives and programs related to corporate culture and enterprise-wide talent development.\n\n'Supporting our People and our Communities' is one of our Responsibility Focus Areas, which includes two goals related to developing a high-performing and diverse talent pipeline: (i) enhance the diversity of our organization and leadership teams while building an inclusive and equitable culture; and (ii) build employee capability and well-being to succeed in uncertain and rapidly changing environments.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent. However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent with skills necessary for us to achieve our Vision. We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies with which we compete for talent. Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements - base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits.\n\nWe are committed to pay equity across our companies. Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in 2024, for employees performing the same or similar duties regardless of any differentiating factors, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 98.2% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our employees of color were 98.2% of those of our white employees. If we adjust for differentiating factors that legitimately influence pay, salaries of our female employees were 99.8% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our employees of color were 99.9% of those of our white employees.\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance. We also offer up to 12 weeks paid family leave to bond with a newborn child, the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for a family member who has a serious health condition. Our benefits also include physical, emotional and financial wellness programs and family creation assistance benefits, such as reimbursement of surrogacy, adoption assistance and doula expenses. While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees.\n\nWe are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through a tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees. We also provide eligible employees with a company-funded contribution applied to the employee's qualified higher education student loans to help reduce student loan debt.\n\n## Attracting, Developing, Retaining and Deploying Talent\n\nWe are focused on identifying the most qualified talent and investing in leader and employee development to build a diverse talent pipeline prepared and willing to lead at every level. Additionally, we are dedicated to being an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of personal background or work function. We recognize the critical importance of these efforts toward pursuing our Vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad and diverse spectrum of backgrounds, skills, experiences and cultures.\n\nOur salaried entry-level recruitment efforts focus on building relationships with university students, internship opportunities and partnerships with organizations that support a broad range of students. We complement these recruiting efforts with hiring experienced employees with demonstrated skills and/or leadership capabilities.\n\nTo help our employees succeed in their roles and develop in their careers, we emphasize ongoing training and leadership development opportunities. Building skills that drive innovation and aligning our employees to our Vision is important for our long-term success. The Human Resources department leads our learning and development efforts partnering with learning professionals embedded in functions throughout our operating and services companies. Employees have access to a wide variety of development programs, including new employee onboarding, in-person, virtual and self-guided training programs, technical training, including training to maintain professional certifications, and our educational refund program for continuing education.",

The fair value of PSUs at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures, is amortized to expense over the performance period. Altria recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to PSUs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 of $6 million, $4 million and $4 million, respectively. The unamortized compensation expense related to PSUs was $12 million at December 31, 2021.\n\n## Note 12.

The total vesting date fair value of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $35 million, $40 million and $29 million, respectively.\n\n- PSUs: We granted an aggregate of 290,980, 255,601 and 215,205 of PSUs during 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The payout of the PSUs is based on the extent to which we achieve certain performance measures over the three-year performance period. Performance measures consist of our adjusted diluted earnings per share compounded annual growth rate and a cash conversion measure. Additionally, the payout resulting from the performance measures is then adjusted up or down by a total shareholder return ('TSR') performance multiplier, which depends on our relative TSR to a predetermined peer group. PSUs are subject to forfeiture if certain employment conditions are not met. At December 31, 2024, we had 750,826 PSUs outstanding, with a weighted-average grant date fair value of $46.87 per PSU. We amortize to expense over the performance period the fair value of PSUs at the date of grant, net of estimated forfeitures. We recorded pre-tax compensation expense related to PSUs for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 of $6 million, $11 million and $9 million, respectively. The unamortized compensation expense related to PSUs was $13 million at December 31, 2024.\n\n## Note 14.

      "question": "How did Altria's (MO) financial exposure to ABI-related special items evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this progression reveal about the company's strategic investment performance and risk management?",
      "answer": "Altria's exposure to ABI-related special items shifted dramatically from a net pre-tax loss of $6,203 million in 2021 (reported in 2022) to a net pre-tax loss of $2,544 million in 2022 (reported in 2023), and further to no ABI-related special items impact in 2024. This indicates a significant deterioration in the value of Altria\u2019s investment in ABI over time, with the largest impairment occurring in 2022, followed by a smaller mark-to-market loss in 2023, and ultimately no ongoing exposure by 2024. This trend suggests that Altria either divested or fully impaired its ABI stake by 2024, reflecting a strategic exit or failure of the investment to meet long-term expectations.",

        "Hop 2: [MO](2023) \u2192 [ABI Special Items]: Records a net pre-tax loss of $2,544 million from ABI in 2022 (disclosed in 2023), primarily due to a non-cash impairment, showing a significant reversal.",
        "Hop 3: [MO](2024) \u2192 [ABI Special Items]: Shows no ABI-related special items impact in 2024, suggesting full impairment or divestiture of the investment."

      "question": "How did Altria's approach to total compensation packages evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of targeted compensation percentiles relative to peer companies and progress toward pay equity for female and employees of color?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Altria consistently targeted total compensation packages between the 50th and 75th percentiles of peer companies to offset talent attraction risks from declining social acceptance of tobacco. In 2022, the company aimed for compensation within that range based on business and individual goals. By 2023, the program emphasized delivering compensation at the 50th to 75th percentiles but allowed for flexibility depending on performance, with actual compensation potentially exceeding the 75th or falling below the 50th percentile. In 2024, the percentile target remained unchanged, but the company introduced student loan repayment assistance as part of benefits. Regarding pay equity, in 2022, female employees earned 99.6% and employees of color earned 99.9% of male and white employees' salaries after adjusting for differentiating factors. In 2023, these figures were 99.6% for women and 99.9% for employees of color. In 2024, the adjusted figures were 99.8% for women and 99.9% for employees of color, showing sustained but slightly fluctuating progress toward pay equity.",

Segment Reporting to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 15').\n- Executive Officers of Altria: The disclosure regarding executive officers is included in Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance Information about Our Executive Officers as of February 15, 2022 of this Form 10-K.\n- Human Capital Resources: We believe our workforce is critical to achieving our Vision. Attracting, developing and retaining the best talent with the skills to make significant progress toward our Vision is a key business priority. Moreover, we recognize the importance of doing business the right way. We believe culture influences employee actions and decision-making. This is why we dedicate resources to promoting a vibrant, inclusive workplace; attracting, developing and retaining talented, diverse employees; promoting a culture of compliance and integrity; creating a safe workplace; and rewarding and recognizing employees for both the results they deliver and, importantly, how they deliver them.\n\n## Oversight and Management\n\nOur Human Resources department is responsible for managing employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, onboarding, compensation and benefits design and implementation, performance management, advancement and succession planning and professional and learning development. Our inclusion, diversity and equity ('ID&amp;E') programs are managed by our Corporate Citizenship department. Our Board of Directors ('Board of Directors' or 'Board') and the Compensation and Talent Development Committee provide oversight of human capital matters, including reviewing initiatives and programs related to corporate culture and enterprise-wide talent development, including our ID&amp;E initiatives.\n\n## Inclusion, Diversity and Equity\n\nWe recognize the critical importance of ID&amp;E in pursuing our Vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad spectrum of backgrounds and cultures. In 2020, we established the following aspirational Inclusion &amp; Diversity Aiming Points to help guide our efforts:\n\n- Be an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of level, demographic group or work function.\n- Have equal numbers of men and women among our vice president and director-level employees.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are Asian, Black, Hispanic or two or more races to at least 30%.\n- Increase our vice president and director-level employees who are LGBTQ+, a person with a disability or a veteran.\n- Have diverse functional leadership teams that reflect the organizations they lead.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, women represented 32% of vice president-level and 41% of director-level roles; Asian, Black, Hispanic or employees of two or more races represented 24% of our vice president-level and 26% of our director-level roles.\n\n## Compensation and Benefits\n\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to help us attract, retain and motivate strong talent. However, we recognize that the decreasing social acceptance of tobacco usage may impact our ability to attract and retain talent. We work to manage this risk by, among other things, targeting total compensation packages to be above peer companies for which we compete for talent. Depending on employee level, total compensation includes different elements - base salary, annual cash incentives, long-term equity and cash incentives and benefits. Our goal is to provide total compensation packages between the 50th and 75th percentiles of total compensation packages paid to employees in comparable positions at our peer companies upon attainment of business and individual goals.\n\nWe are committed to pay equity across our companies. Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in November 2021, adjusting for factors generally considered to be legitimate differentiators of salary, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 99.6% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our non-white employees were 99.9% of those of our white employees.\n\nIn addition to cash and equity compensation, we offer generous employee benefits such as significant company contributions to deferred profit sharing plans, consumer-driven health plan coverage, vacation and holiday pay, disability and life insurance, and up to 12 weeks paid parental and family leave for birth, adoption and foster placement and an additional six weeks paid leave for birth mothers. Our benefits also include mental health and wellness benefits and family creation assistance benefits, such as adoption assistance and coverage for fertility treatments. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, for 2020 and 2021, we expanded dependent care coverage to include $5,000 employee reimbursement for remote learning and other dependent care costs. In addition, we offered financial incentives to our employees to encourage vaccination against COVID-19. While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees.\n\nWe are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through an unlimited tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees.",

Based on the most recent annual analysis we conducted in 2024, for employees performing the same or similar duties regardless of any differentiating factors, such as performance and tenure, salaries of our female employees were 98.2% of those of our male employees, and salaries of our employees of color were 98.2% of those of our white employees.

We also offer up to 12 weeks paid family leave to bond with a newborn child, the placement of a child for adoption or foster care, or to care for a family member who has a serious health condition. Our benefits also include physical, emotional and financial wellness programs and family creation assistance benefits, such as reimbursement of surrogacy, adoption assistance and doula expenses. While there is some variability in employee benefits across our companies, the examples we provide are available to most employees.\n\nWe are also committed to investing in the educational development of our workforce through a tuition refund program for job-related courses or company-related degrees. We also provide eligible employees with a company-funded contribution applied to the employee's qualified higher education student loans to help reduce student loan debt.\n\n## Attracting, Developing, Retaining and Deploying Talent\n\nWe are focused on identifying the most qualified talent and investing in leader and employee development to build a diverse talent pipeline prepared and willing to lead at every level. Additionally, we are dedicated to being an inclusive place to work for all employees, regardless of personal background or work function. We recognize the critical importance of these efforts toward pursuing our Vision and believe in the value of a workforce composed of a broad and diverse spectrum of backgrounds, skills, experiences and cultures.\n\nOur salaried entry-level recruitment efforts focus on building relationships with university students, internship opportunities and partnerships with organizations that support a broad range of students. We complement these recruiting efforts with hiring experienced employees with demonstrated skills and/or leadership capabilities.\n\nTo help our employees succeed in their roles and develop in their careers, we emphasize ongoing training and leadership development opportunities. Building skills that drive innovation and aligning our employees to our Vision is important for our long-term success. The Human Resources department leads our learning and development efforts partnering with learning professionals embedded in functions throughout our operating and services companies. Employees have access to a wide variety of development programs, including new employee onboarding, in-person, virtual and self-guided training programs, technical training, including training to maintain professional certifications, and our educational refund program for continuing education.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Altria's reported OCI declined significantly, decreasing by $59 million in 2022, increasing by $90 million in 2023, and then falling sharply by $273 million in 2024. In 2022, the decline was driven by higher costs, including acquisition-related expenses and volume/mix impacts. In 2023, reported OCI rebounded due to higher pricing and lower costs, despite volume/mix headwinds. However, in 2024, the large drop was primarily due to a non-cash impairment of the Skoal trademark ($354 million), along with lower shipment volume and a higher percentage of on! shipment volume relative to MST. This trajectory reveals a volatile trend in reported OCI, heavily influenced by one-time impairments and shifting product mix.",

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z's acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments shifted significantly across the three years: in 2022, the company incurred $40M in such costs; in 2023, these costs surged to $246M; and by 2024, the company recorded a reversal of $315M. This trajectory indicates that Mondel\u0113z was actively managing integration activities in 2023, likely related to new acquisitions or ongoing integration efforts. The reversal in 2024 suggests that prior accruals or liabilities related to contingent consideration were adjusted downward, possibly due to favorable resolution of earn-out terms or completion of integration milestones. Together, these changes reflect a transition from active integration spending to a more mature phase of post-acquisition management, highlighting improved financial forecasting or successful execution against integration targets.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MDLZ](2023) \u2192 [Acquisition Integration Costs and Contingent Consideration Adjustments]: $246M in costs were recorded, reflecting ongoing integration activities and adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities.",
        "Hop 2: [MDLZ](2024) \u2192 [Acquisition Integration Costs and Contingent Consideration Adjustments]: A reversal of $315M was recorded, indicating a significant downward adjustment in previously estimated contingent consideration or completion of integration-related obligations.",
        "Hop 3: [MDLZ](2022) \u2192 [Acquisition Integration Costs and Contingent Consideration Adjustments]: $40M in costs were incurred, suggesting early-stage integration expenses or smaller-scale M&A activity compared to 2023."

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z International's equity method investment net earnings declined from $385 million in 2022 to $160 million in 2023, before slightly recovering to $168 million in 2024. This downward trend followed by marginal improvement suggests a period of financial pressure on its joint ventures, with limited recovery in later years.",

      "answer": "MDLZ's allowance for long-term receivables increased from $14 million at the end of 2022 to $15 million at the end of 2023, and further to $16 million at the end of 2024. This steady increase suggests a growing concern or provisioning for potential credit losses on long-term receivables over the three-year period, despite relatively stable write-offs at $0 in 2022, $0 in 2023, and $5 million in 2024. The company consistently adjusted its provisions, with a $1 million increase in 2023 and a $2 million reduction in 2024, indicating a cautious approach to managing credit risk in long-term receivables.",

      "question": "How did Walmart's approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be repurchased under its programs evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's long-term capital allocation strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Walmart's approximate dollar value of shares that may yet be repurchased was $10.6 billion as of January 31, 2022, and ended the fiscal year with approximately $12.4 billion remaining. In 2023, the company began the period with $17.8 billion remaining under the repurchase program, indicating a significant increase in authorization. By 2024, the remaining dollar value had settled at $13.1 billion as of November 2024. This trajectory suggests that Walmart initially increased its commitment to share repurchases in 2023, likely signaling confidence in its financial position, but scaled back slightly in 2024, potentially reflecting a rebalancing of capital allocation priorities.",

      "answer": "Walmart consistently asserted across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024 that its current cash position, combined with cash flows from operations and access to capital markets, was sufficient to meet its seasonal inventory financing needs. In 2022, the company disclosed $27.9 billion in unrecorded purchase obligations, with $9.3 billion due within one year, underscoring the scale of commitments tied to inventory procurement. Despite this, Walmart reaffirmed in both 2023 and 2024 that its liquidity position remained adequate to fund seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories, along with other capital and operating requirements such as acquisitions, dividends, and share repurchases. The consistent messaging across all three years suggests a stable liquidity strategy, even as the underlying obligations and macroeconomic conditions may have shifted. This multi-year stance implies confidence in cash flow predictability and financial flexibility to manage inventory cycles without significant disruption.",

Other material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations include short-term borrowings, long-term debt and related interest payments, leases and purchase obligations. See Note 6 and Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt, and leases, respectively.\n\nAs of January 31, 2022, the Company has $27.9 billion of unrecorded purchase obligations outstanding, of which $9.3 billion is due within one year. Purchase obligations include legally binding contracts, such as firm commitments for inventory and utility purchases, as well as commitments to make capital expenditures, software acquisition and license commitments and legally binding service contracts. Contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Contracts that specify the Company will purchase all or a portion of its requirements of a specific product or service from a supplier, but do not include a fixed or minimum quantity, are excluded from the obligations quantified above. Accordingly, purchase orders for inventory are also excluded as purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. Our purchase orders are based on our current inventory needs and are fulfilled by our suppliers within short time periods. We also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon amounts for some obligations.\n\n## Capital Resources\n\nWe believe our cash flows from operations, current cash position, short-term borrowings and access to capital markets will continue to be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements and contractual obligations, which includes funding seasonal buildups in merchandise inventories and funding our capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and share repurchases.\n\nWe have strong commercial paper and long-term debt ratings that have enabled and should continue to enable us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets. As of January 31, 2022, the ratings assigned to our commercial paper and rated series of our outstanding long-term debt were as follows:",

      "question": "How did The Coca-Cola Company's prioritization of business development needs influence its dividend policy and shareholder returns from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about its capital allocation strategy?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, The Coca-Cola Company consistently cited business development needs as a key factor influencing its dividend policy and capital allocation decisions. In 2022, the company noted that dividend payments were subject to factors including business development needs, indicating that growth initiatives could constrain shareholder returns. In 2023, the language shifted slightly, with the company guiding that business development needs would continue to shape decisions, but with a more forward-looking tone suggesting strategic alignment with long-term growth. By 2024, the company reaffirmed this stance, maintaining that dividends remained discretionary and dependent on financial condition, regulatory considerations, and business development priorities. During this period, the number of shareowner accounts decreased from 191,391 in 2022 to 182,362 in 2023 and further to 176,283 in 2024, potentially reflecting consolidation or institutional ownership trends. This consistent emphasis on business development needs across all three years suggests a capital allocation strategy that prioritizes reinvestment for growth over increasing shareholder payouts, even amid stable financial performance.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the 10-year annualized return on U.S. pension plan assets was 9.7%. In 2023, this figure declined to 6.1%, and by 2024, it had partially recovered to 5.5%. This represents a downward trend over the three-year period, with a notable drop in 2023 followed by a modest rebound in 2024. During this time, KO's expected long-term rate of return assumption remained stable at 6.75% in both 2023 and 2024, indicating that the actual 10-year annualized returns underperformed the company's assumed rate for at least two consecutive years.

The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities. Plan obligations are determined by applying projected cash flows to the individual spot rates from the yield curve. The disclosed discount rate is the rate that would produce the same obligation as the applicable yield curve. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected benefit cash flows, or for other non-U.S. plans referenced above, this is measured using the discount rate derived from appropriate indices. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\n\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six -month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80% for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan's year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10 years.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes.

We will consider several alternatives for settling this long-term debt, including the use of cash flows from operating activities, issuance of commercial paper or issuance of other longterm debt. The table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the Company and excludes the noncash portion of debt, including any fair market value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums. 2\n\nWe calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the December 31, 2021 rate for all periods presented. We expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings. 3\n\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. Accrued income taxes include $3,294 million related to the one-time transition tax required by the Tax Reform Act. Liabilities of $1,347 million for unrecognized tax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties were not included in the total above. Currently, the settlement period for the unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. 4\n\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These agreements include long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities. 5\n\nWe expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. 6\n\nRepresents obligations related to our acquisitions of fairlife and BodyArmor.

Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, net periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the table above.\n\nWe expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities. Our pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and tax regulations. The Company expects to contribute $26 million in 2022 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $5,486 million, and the fair value of the plans' assets was $5,383 million.

The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities. Plan obligations are determined by applying projected cash flows to the individual spot rates from the yield curve. The disclosed discount rate is the rate that would produce the same obligation as the applicable yield curve. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected benefit cash flows, or for other non-U.S. plans referenced above, this is measured using the discount rate derived from appropriate indices. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\n\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six -month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80% for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan's year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10 years.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes.

      "answer": "In 2022, lower cigarette volume, especially in the Czech Republic, France, and Germany, partly offset gains from heated tobacco and device volumes, yet net revenues still rose 8.8% (excluding currency and acquisitions), driven by pricing and mix improvements. In 2023, cigarette volume declines again offset some growth, but strong HTU volume and pricing gains led to an 11.2% increase in net revenues (excluding currency and acquisitions). By 2024, despite continued declines in cigarette volume, robust combustible pricing and HTU growth contributed to a 7.1% increase in net revenues (excluding currency and acquisitions), though the German tax surcharge on HTPs began to weigh on pricing variance starting in 2022 and persisted through 2024. This 3-year trajectory shows a consistent shift away from traditional cigarettes, partially offset by strategic pricing and growth in next-generation products.",

Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 7.1%, reflecting a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume and adverse cigarette mix.\n\nThe pricing variance for 2023 and 2024 was negatively impacted by the supplemental tax surcharge on heated tobacco products (\"HTPs\") in G ermany, which went into effect in 2022. On March 14, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") ruled that the G erman fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. On May 15, 2024, following the decision issued by CJEU, the Fiscal Court in Dusseldorf (the \"FCD\") also ruled that the German fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. The FCD admitted an appeal to the Federal Tax Court. On June 19, 2024,  PMI submitted an appeal. The negative impact will continue, at least until the appeal ruling on the legality of the surcharge is concluded.  PMI currently accounts for the surcharge as a reduction in net revenues, with amounts withdrawn before May 15, 2024, currently under a payment suspension. Despite this payment suspension and, in order to avoid the future addition of interest, PMI elected, on January 14, 2025, to pay the amount outstanding of EUR 721 million (approximately $751 million), excluding accrued interest. An unfavorable outcome to the appeal would negatively impact PMI's future cash provided by operating activities for the amounts of unpaid interest. A favorable outcome to the appeal would positively impact future PMI's operating results and future cash provided by operating activities for the amounts paid in January 2025.",

      "question": "How did Philip Morris's heated tobacco unit shipment volumes evolve from 2021 to 2024, and what does this growth trajectory indicate about the company's strategic shift toward smoke-free products and its ability to scale this business segment competitively?",
      "answer": "Philip Morris's heated tobacco unit (HTU) shipment volume grew significantly from 95.0 billion units in 2021 to 125.3 billion units in 2023 and further to 139.7 billion units in 2024, representing a compound growth rate of approximately 13.6% over the three-year period. This consistent increase reflects the company's strategic emphasis on transitioning toward reduced-risk products (RRPs), particularly through its IQOS platform. In 2023, the acquisition and integration of Swedish Match further accelerated this shift by complementing PMI\u2019s smoke-free portfolio with ZYN nicotine pouches and enhancing its market presence in the U.S. and other regions. By 2024, PMI had expanded its smoke-free product availability to 95 markets and nicotine pouch presence to 37 markets, reinforcing its competitive positioning in the global smoke-free category. The sustained growth in HTU shipments indicates that PMI is successfully scaling its smoke-free business, aligning with its long-term ambition to replace traditional combustible products with better alternatives.",

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro , L&amp;M , Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield , which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand  umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\n\nThe  competitive  environment  and  our  competitive  position  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  weak  economic  conditions,  erosion  of consumer  confidence,  competitors'  introduction  of  lower-price  products  or  innovative  products,  higher  tobacco  product  taxes,  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products  and  restricts  adult  consumer  access  to  truthful  and  non-misleading  information  about  our  RRPs.  Competitors  in  our  industry include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and  local  tobacco  companies  and,  in  some  instances,  state-owned  tobacco  enterprises,  principally  in Algeria,  Egypt,  the  PRC,  Taiwan, Thailand  and  Vietnam.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative products  through  inappropriate  marketing  campaigns,  messaging  and  inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the  dissemination  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  information  about  our  RRPs,  all  of  which  could  have  a  mutual  adverse  effect  on  our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Procurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2021, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2021, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI's global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe  believe  that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  tobacco  leaf  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production requirements.",

We have a wide range of premium, mid-price and low-price brands. Our portfolio comprises both international and local brands and is led by Marlboro ,  the  world's  best-selling international cigarette, which accounted for approximately 40% of our total 2024 cigarette shipment volume.

Accordingly, our right, and thus the right of our creditors and stockholders, to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of any subsidiary is subject to the prior rights of creditors of such subsidiary, ex cept to the ex tent that claims of  our  company  itself  as  a  creditor  may  be  recognized. As  a  holding  company,  our  principal  sources  of  funds,  including  funds  to  make  payment  on  our  debt securities, are from the receipt of dividends and repayment of debt from our subsidiaries. Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n\n## Description of Business\n\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023. Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro , increased by 3.7% in 2024.\n\nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry (or total market) and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China.

Our principal wholly owned and majority-owned subsidiaries currently are not limited by long-term debt or other agreements in their ability to pay cash dividends or to make other distributions that are otherwise compliant with law, including governmental capital and foreign currency exchange controls.\n\n## Description of Business\n\nFollowing the combination and the progress in 2023 toward the integration of the Swedish Match business into PMI's existing regional structure, PMI updated in January 2024 its segment reporting by including the former Swedish Match segment results into the four existing geographical segments. Our four geographical segments are as follows:\n\n- Europe Region is headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, and covers all the European Union countries, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and also Ukraine, Moldova and Southeast Europe;\n- South and Southeast Asia, Commonwealth of Independent States, Middle East and Africa Region (\"SSEA, CIS &amp; MEA\") is headquartered in Dubai, United Arab Emirates. It covers South and Southeast Asia, the African continent, the Middle East, Turkey, as well as Israel, Central Asia, Caucasus and Russia;\n- East Asia, Australia, and PMI Duty Free Region (\"EA, AU &amp; PMI DF\") is headquartered in Hong Kong, and includes the consolidation of our international duty free business with East Asia &amp; Australia; and\n- Americas Region is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, and covers the United States, Canada and Latin America.\n\nOur Wellness and Healthcare (\"W&amp;H\") segment, which includes the operating results of our Wellness and Healthcare business, remained unchanged in 2024.\n\nFollowing the sale of V ectura G roup Ltd. on December 31, 2024, we will update our segment reporting by including the remaining Wellness &amp; Healthcare results in the Europe segment. In addition, we will be renaming our 'PMI Duty Free' business to 'PMI G lobal Travel Retail' effective in the first quarter of 2025. As a result of this change, PMI's segment that includes our duty free business will be renamed East Asia, Australia &amp; PMI G lobal Travel Retail ('EA, AU &amp; PMI GTR').  As of the first quarter of 2025, our reporting will reflect these changes.\n\nOur total shipment volume, including cigarettes and heated tobacco units, increased by 2.5% in 2024 to 756.6 billion units, with shipment volume of heated tobacco units reaching 139.7 billion units in 2024, up from 125.3 billion units in 2023. Shipment volume of our principal cigarette brand, Marlboro , increased by 3.7% in 2024.\n\nReferences in this Form 10-K to total international market, defined as worldwide cigarette and heated tobacco unit volume, excluding the United States, total industry (or total market) and market shares, are our estimates for tax-paid products based on data from a number of internal and external sources, and may, in defined instances, exclude China. Past reported periods may be updated to ensure comparability and to incorporate the most current information for industry and market share reporting.",

      "answer": "Altria's 'Accrued Liabilities - Other' fluctuated over the three-year period: $192 million in 2022, $197 million in 2023, and $177 million in 2024. This represents a slight increase from 2022 to 2023, followed by a more notable decrease in 2024. The trend suggests a temporary rise in short-term obligations in 2023, which was subsequently reduced in 2024, potentially indicating improved liability management or operational adjustments.",

      "question": "How did Colgate-Palmolive's use of net selling price increases evolve across its Oral, Personal and Home Care segment and Hill's Pet Nutrition from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's pricing strategy in different product categories?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Colgate-Palmolive increasingly relied on net selling price increases to drive organic sales growth, particularly in Hill's Pet Nutrition and the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment. In 2022, net selling price increases contributed 2.5% to the Oral, Personal and Home Care segment and 5.5% to Hill's Pet Nutrition. By 2023, Hill's saw a significant jump to 11.0% net selling price increases. In 2024, the company maintained elevated pricing in both segments, with 4.4% net selling price increases in Oral, Personal and Home Care and 4.1% in Hill's Pet Nutrition.

This trajectory shows a recovery and strengthening of operational performance, supported by the Global Productivity Initiative, which contributed $85 million in 2024 after $27 million in 2023 and $95 million in 2022.

The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nNet cash provided by operations decreased to $3,325 in 2021 as compared to $3,719 in 2020, primarily due to changes in working capital. The Company's working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (2.7)% in 2021 and (4.4)% in 2020. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales is primarily due to lower accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts payable and higher prepaid expenses. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding shortterm debt).\n\nInvesting activities used $592 of cash in 2021 compared to $779 during 2020. Investing activities in 2020 included the acquisition of hello for cash consideration of $351 as part of the Company's continued strategy to focus on the high growth segments within its Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. This acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash.\n\nCapital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $567, an increase from $410 in 2020. Capital expenditures increased in 2021 primarily due to capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and sustainability projects. Capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be approximately 4.0% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns.\n\nFinancing activities used $2,774 of cash during 2021 compared to $2,919 during 2020. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in net payments on debt, partially offset by higher share repurchases, net in 2021 as compared to 2020.\n\nIn 2020, as a result of the incremental debt related to recent acquisitions, net of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, the Company moderated its share repurchases, net. In addition, due to the initial uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and our intent to preserve cash, the Company discontinued all share repurchases other than those pursuant to equity plans during the second quarter of 2020. The Company resumed its share repurchases, at a moderated level, net in the third quarter of 2020. Share repurchases, net returned to historical levels in 2021.\n\nLong-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $7,206 as of December 31, 2021, as compared to $7,343 as of December 31, 2020, and total debt decreased to $7,245 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to $7,601 as of December 31, 2020. The Company's debt issuances and redemptions support the Company's capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company issued \u20ac500 of eight-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.300% (the 'Sustainability Bond'). The debt issuance was under the Company's shelf registration statement. An amount equal to the net proceeds of the Sustainability Bond will be used to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and existing projects and programs with distinct environmental or social benefits pursuant to the Company's Sustainable Financing Framework.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed prior to maturity all of its outstanding 0.000% notes due 2021 with a principal amount of \u20ac500, originally issued on November 12, 2019. The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings. The redemption price was equal to the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.\n\nIn 1990, the Company's Canadian subsidiary ('CP Canada'), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the 'Canada notes'). During the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75, which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.",

The increase in cash used was primarily due to higher share repurchases, partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\n\nLong-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $7,941 as of December 31, 2024, as compared to $8,239 as of December 31, 2023, and total debt decreased to $7,949 as of December 31, 2024 as compared to $8,549 as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company redeemed at maturity $500 of ten-year Medium-Term Notes with a fixed coupon of 3.25%. The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings.\n\nIn March 2023, the Company issued $500 of three-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.800%, $500 of five-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.600% and $500 of ten-year Senior Notes at a fix ed coupon rate of 4.600%. The Company's debt issuances support the Company's capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,725 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement.\n\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for a five-year term expiring November 2027, which replaced, on substantially similar terms, the Company's $3,000 revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in August 2026. In November 2023, the Company extended the term of the credit facility for an additional year, expiring in November 2028. In November 2024, the Company further extended the term of the credit facility for an additional year, expiring in November 2029. Commitment fees related to the credit facility were not material.\n\nDomestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $936 and $906 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2024 and 2023 were $1,710 and $1,800, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its available lines of credit (under the facilities discussed above).",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's net selling price increases for Hill's Pet Nutrition were 5.5% in 2022, 11.0% in 2023, and 4.1% in 2024. This pattern indicates a significant price increase in 2023, followed by a return to a more moderate pricing strategy in 2024. The 2023 spike likely reflects a deliberate pricing strategy to offset rising raw and packaging material costs, while the 2024 decrease suggests a recalibration to sustain volume growth and manage market demand after a year of aggressive pricing.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's Non-GAAP Net Income Including Noncontrolling Interests increased from $2,891 million in 2022 to $2,655 million in 2023, and then rose to $3,122 million in 2024. This reflects a volatile trend with a dip in 2023 followed by a strong rebound in 2024, suggesting that while the company faced headwinds in 2023, it regained momentum in 2024 after adjusting for restructuring and productivity initiative costs. The 2023 decline was influenced by the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative and acquisition-related charges, while the 2024 improvement indicates successful cost management and operational execution.",

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's GAAP operating profit increased from $2,893 million in 2022 to $3,984 million in 2023, and further to $4,268 million in 2024, representing a 38% increase between 2022 and 2023, and a 7% increase between 2023 and 2024. The 2022 Global Productivity Initiative contributed $95 million in 2022, declined to $27 million in 2023, and increased to $85 million in 2024, indicating a resurgence in realized efficiency gains. Product recall costs were a $25 million headwind in 2023 but were absent in 2024, contributing to margin improvement. This 3-year trend shows a transformation from a challenging base year (2022, which included a goodwill impairment charge of $721 million) to consistent growth and margin expansion, with GAAP operating margin rising from 20.5% in 2023 to 21.2% in 2024, reflecting improved cost management and execution of productivity programs.",

This represents a significant downward trend, indicating improved operational efficiency, particularly through higher accounts payable and accruals and lower inventory in 2023 and 2024.

The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nNet cash provided by operations increased 10% to $4,107 in 2024 as compared to $3,745 in 2023, primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by changes in working capital. The Company's working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (5.2)% in 2024 and (1.4)% in 2023. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales was primarily due to higher accounts payable and accruals. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (ex cluding short-term debt).\n\nInvesting activities used $534 of cash in 2024 compared to $742 during 2023.\n\nCapital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2024 were $561, a decrease from $705 in 2023. Capital expenditures for 2025 are expected to be approximately 3.0% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax  returns.\n\nFinancing activities used $3,389 of cash during the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to $2,793 during 2023. The increase in cash used was primarily due to higher share repurchases, partially offset by higher proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\n\nLong-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $7,941 as of December 31, 2024, as compared to $8,239 as of December 31, 2023, and total debt decreased to $7,949 as of December 31, 2024 as compared to $8,549 as of December 31, 2023. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company redeemed at maturity $500 of ten-year Medium-Term Notes with a fixed coupon of 3.25%. The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings.\n\nIn March 2023, the Company issued $500 of three-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.800%, $500 of five-year Senior Notes at a fixed coupon rate of 4.600% and $500 of ten-year Senior Notes at a fix ed coupon rate of 4.600%. The Company's debt issuances support the Company's capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the Company had access to unused domestic and foreign lines of credit of $3,725 (including under the facility discussed below) and could also issue long-term debt pursuant to an effective shelf registration statement.\n\nIn November 2022, the Company entered into an amended and restated $3,000 five-year revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks for a five-year term expiring November 2027, which replaced, on substantially similar terms, the Company's $3,000 revolving credit facility that was scheduled to expire in August 2026. In November 2023, the Company extended the term of the credit facility for an additional year, expiring in November 2028. In November 2024, the Company further extended the term of the credit facility for an additional year, expiring in November 2029. Commitment fees related to the credit facility were not material.\n\nDomestic and foreign commercial paper outstanding was $936 and $906 as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, respectively. The average daily balances outstanding of commercial paper in 2024 and 2023 were $1,710 and $1,800, respectively. The Company classifies commercial paper as long-term debt when it has the intent and ability to refinance such obligations on a long-term basis, including, if necessary, by utilizing its available lines of credit (under the facilities discussed above).",

The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nNet cash provided by operations decreased to $3,325 in 2021 as compared to $3,719 in 2020, primarily due to changes in working capital. The Company's working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (2.7)% in 2021 and (4.4)% in 2020. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales is primarily due to lower accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts payable and higher prepaid expenses. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding shortterm debt).\n\nInvesting activities used $592 of cash in 2021 compared to $779 during 2020. Investing activities in 2020 included the acquisition of hello for cash consideration of $351 as part of the Company's continued strategy to focus on the high growth segments within its Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. This acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash.\n\nCapital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $567, an increase from $410 in 2020. Capital expenditures increased in 2021 primarily due to capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and sustainability projects. Capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be approximately 4.0% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns.\n\nFinancing activities used $2,774 of cash during 2021 compared to $2,919 during 2020. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in net payments on debt, partially offset by higher share repurchases, net in 2021 as compared to 2020.\n\nIn 2020, as a result of the incremental debt related to recent acquisitions, net of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, the Company moderated its share repurchases, net. In addition, due to the initial uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and our intent to preserve cash, the Company discontinued all share repurchases other than those pursuant to equity plans during the second quarter of 2020. The Company resumed its share repurchases, at a moderated level, net in the third quarter of 2020. Share repurchases, net returned to historical levels in 2021.\n\nLong-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $7,206 as of December 31, 2021, as compared to $7,343 as of December 31, 2020, and total debt decreased to $7,245 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to $7,601 as of December 31, 2020. The Company's debt issuances and redemptions support the Company's capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company issued \u20ac500 of eight-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.300% (the 'Sustainability Bond'). The debt issuance was under the Company's shelf registration statement. An amount equal to the net proceeds of the Sustainability Bond will be used to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and existing projects and programs with distinct environmental or social benefits pursuant to the Company's Sustainable Financing Framework.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed prior to maturity all of its outstanding 0.000% notes due 2021 with a principal amount of \u20ac500, originally issued on November 12, 2019. The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings. The redemption price was equal to the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.\n\nIn 1990, the Company's Canadian subsidiary ('CP Canada'), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the 'Canada notes'). During the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75, which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.",

      "answer": "From FY2022 to FY2024, Target's gift card liability fluctuated, starting at $1,202 million in 2022, decreasing to $1,162 million in 2023, and increasing to $1,209 million in 2024. During this time, the value of gift cards issued but not redeemed declined from $903 million in 2022 to $829 million in 2023, then rose to $878 million in 2024. Meanwhile, the revenue recognized from the beginning liability was $736 million in 2022, increased to $907 million in 2023, and then dropped to $831 million in 2024.

      "question": "How did the prominence and treatment of Target's 'Consideration Received from Vendors' evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of its relative positioning in financial statement disclosures and its potential impact on cost management strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, 'Consideration Received from Vendors' was disclosed in Note 6 of the financial statements, following notes on revenue and cost of sales, indicating a foundational treatment of vendor rebates in the financial reporting structure. In 2023, the disclosure moved earlier in the notes to become Note 5, suggesting increased emphasis on vendor considerations, possibly reflecting strategic supplier negotiations or increased reliance on vendor support amid inflationary pressures. By 2024, the disclosure was further elevated to Note 4, directly following cost of sales, signaling a heightened strategic focus on vendor rebates as a key component of cost management. This progression implies that Target increasingly viewed vendor consideration as a critical lever for maintaining gross margins over the three-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TGT(2022) \u2192 Consideration Received from Vendors: Disclosed in Note 6, following revenue and cost of sales disclosures.",
        "Hop 2: TGT(2023) \u2192 Consideration Received from Vendors: Elevated to Note 5, indicating increased prominence in financial reporting.",
        "Hop 3: TGT(2024) \u2192 Consideration Received from Vendors: Moved to Note 4, immediately after cost of sales, signaling strategic importance."

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Procter & Gamble's ESOP debt service requirements were consistently netted against plan assets for other retiree benefits, reflecting a stable accounting treatment. In 2022, actuarial gains for other retiree benefits were primarily driven by increases in discount rates, partially offset by unfavorable medical claim experience. In 2023, actuarial gains for other retiree benefits were again influenced by higher discount rates, now paired with a decrease in assumptions for medical claims costs. By 2024, the actuarial gains for other retiree benefits were tied to updated plan assumptions based on work experience and an increase in discount rates. This progression shows that P&G adjusted its assumptions over time\u2014particularly around medical cost trends and work experience\u2014while relying on higher discount rates to reduce liabilities, indicating a strategic recalibration of long-term benefit obligations.",

The actuarial gain for other retiree benefits in 2024 was primarily related to updating various assumptions in the plan based work experience and an increase in discount rates. The actuarial gain for pension plans in 2023 was primarily related to increases in discount rates, offset by inflationrelated  pension  benefit  increases.

In these instances, benefit payments are typically paid directly from the Company's cash as they become due.\n\n",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's amortization of prior service cost/credit for Other Retiree Benefits increased from a credit of $107 million in fiscal 2022 to $125 million in fiscal 2023, and remained high at $127 million in fiscal 2024.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, P&G reported net amounts recognized in AOCI for pension benefits at $2,076 million. This figure decreased to $1,974 million in fiscal 2023 and further declined to $1,398 million in fiscal 2024. The consistent reduction in AOCI amounts related to pension benefits indicates that the company may have taken steps to reduce pension liabilities, potentially through asset reallocations, benefit adjustments, or updated actuarial assumptions that reduced projected obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Procter & Gamble's funded status was underfunded by $2,435 million. By 2023, the underfunded position improved to $2,125 million, and in 2024, it further improved to $1,498 million. This consistent improvement in funded status over the three-year period indicates stronger pension asset returns and effective liability management, despite ongoing pension obligations and currency translation impacts.",

        "Hop 1: [PG](2022) \u2192 [Plan Asset Translation]: The funded status was underfunded by $2,435 million, reflecting a significant gap between pension obligations and plan assets.",
        "Hop 2: [PG](2023) \u2192 [Plan Asset Translation]: The underfunded status improved to $2,125 million, showing progress in reducing the pension liability gap.",
        "Hop 3: [PG](2024) \u2192 [Plan Asset Translation]: The funded status further improved to $1,498 million, continuing the positive trend of liability reduction and asset growth."

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, The Coca-Cola Company consistently cited business development needs as a key factor influencing dividend and share repurchase decisions. In 2022, the company reported 191,391 shareowner accounts of record, indicating a relatively broad retail investor base. By 2023, this number decreased slightly to 182,362 accounts, and further declined to 176,283 in 2024, suggesting a shrinking shareholder base despite ongoing share repurchase programs. The company's disclosures in each year emphasized that repurchase activity and dividend policy were directly impacted by its business development needs, implying a strategic trade-off between returning capital to shareholders and reinvesting in growth opportunities. This trend indicates a progressively more conservative capital return strategy as business development needs took precedence over expanding shareholder participation.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities. Plan obligations are determined by applying projected cash flows to the individual spot rates from the yield curve. The disclosed discount rate is the rate that would produce the same obligation as the applicable yield curve. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected benefit cash flows, or for other non-U.S. plans referenced above, this is measured using the discount rate derived from appropriate indices. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\n\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six -month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80% for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan's year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10 years.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the ex pected long-term rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2024 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans was 6.75%. As of December 31, 2024, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was 3.7%, 5.5% and 7.1%, respectively. The annualized return since inception was 9.7%.\n\nThe weighted-average assumptions for health care cost trend rates were as follows:\n\n",

The table above shows expected cash payments to be made by the Company and excludes the noncash portion of debt, including any fair market value adjustments, unamortized discounts and premiums. 2\n\nWe calculated estimated interest payments for our long-term debt based on the applicable rates and payment dates. For our variable-rate debt, we have assumed the December 31, 2021 rate for all periods presented. We expect to fund such interest payments with cash flows from operating activities and/or short-term borrowings. 3\n\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding income taxes. Accrued income taxes include $3,294 million related to the one-time transition tax required by the Tax Reform Act. Liabilities of $1,347 million for unrecognized tax benefits plus accrued interest and penalties were not included in the total above. Currently, the settlement period for the unrecognized tax benefits cannot be determined. In addition, any payments related to unrecognized tax benefits may be partially or fully offset by reductions in payments in other jurisdictions. 4\n\nPurchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms. These agreements include long-term contractual obligations, open purchase orders, accounts payable and certain accrued liabilities. We expect to fund these purchase obligations with cash flows from operating activities. 5\n\nWe expect to fund these marketing obligations with cash flows from operating activities. 6\n\nRepresents obligations related to our acquisitions of fairlife and BodyArmor. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 7\n\nRepresents liabilities and contractual obligations of the Company's bottling operations that are classified as held for sale. 8\n\nThe total accrued liability for pension and other postretirement benefit plans recognized as of December 31, 2021 was $1,497 million. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. This amount is impacted by, among other items, net periodic benefit cost or income, plan funding levels, plan amendments, changes in plan demographics and assumptions, and the investment return on plan assets. Because the accrued liability does not represent expected liquidity needs, we did not include this amount in the table above.\n\nWe expect to make all contributions to our pension trusts with cash flows from operating activities. Our pension plans are generally funded in accordance with local laws and tax regulations. The Company expects to contribute $26 million in 2022 to our pension trusts, all of which will be allocated to our international plans. Refer to Note 13 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We did not include our estimated contributions to our pension trusts in the table above.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. qualified pension plans was $5,486 million, and the fair value of the plans' assets was $5,383 million. The projected benefit obligation of all pension plans other than the U.S. qualified pension plans was $3,094 million, and the fair value of the plans' assets was $3,522 million.

The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities. Plan obligations are determined by applying projected cash flows to the individual spot rates from the yield curve. The disclosed discount rate is the rate that would produce the same obligation as the applicable yield curve. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected benefit cash flows, or for other non-U.S. plans referenced above, this is measured using the discount rate derived from appropriate indices. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\n\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six -month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80% for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan's year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10 years.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the ex pected long-term rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2024 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans was 6.75%. As of December 31, 2024, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was 3.7%, 5.5% and 7.1%, respectively.

          "chunk_text": "\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension and other postretirement benefit plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities. Plan obligations are determined by applying projected cash flows to the individual spot rates from the yield curve. The disclosed discount rate is the rate that would produce the same obligation as the applicable yield curve. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected benefit cash flows, or for other non-U.S. plans referenced above, this is measured using the discount rate derived from appropriate indices. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\n\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six -month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80% for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan's year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10 years.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes. We evaluate the ex pected long-term rate of return assumption on an annual basis. The expected long-term rate of return assumption used in computing 2024 net periodic benefit income for the U.S. pension plans was 6.75%. As of December 31, 2024, the 5-year, 10-year and 15-year annualized return for the U.S. pension plan assets was 3.7%, 5.5% and 7.1%, respectively. The annualized return since inception was 9.7%.\n\nThe weighted-average assumptions for health care cost trend rates were as follows:\n\n",

The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities. Plan obligations are determined by applying projected cash flows to the individual spot rates from the yield curve. The disclosed discount rate is the rate that would produce the same obligation as the applicable yield curve. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost or income for pension and other postretirement benefit plans by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected benefit cash flows, or for other non-U.S. plans referenced above, this is measured using the discount rate derived from appropriate indices. The rate of compensation increase assumption is determined by the Company based upon annual reviews.\n\nThe cash balance interest crediting rate for the U.S. qualified pension plan is based on the yield on six -month U.S. Treasury bills on the last day of September of the previous plan year, plus 150 basis points, with a minimum interest crediting rate of 3.80% for all active employees and certain former employees. The Company assumes that the ultimate interest crediting rate is 140 basis points lower than the plan's year-end discount rate and that the current interest crediting rate will converge with the ultimate interest crediting rate after a period of 10 years.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return assumption for U.S. pension plan assets is based upon the target asset allocation and is determined using forward-looking assumptions in the context of historical returns and volatilities for each asset class, as well as correlations among asset classes.

      "answer": "In 2022, Hill's Pet Nutrition achieved 13.5% organic sales growth, partly driven by net selling price increases of 5.5%. In 2023, the company significantly increased its reliance on pricing, with net selling price increases of 11.0% contributing to 10.5% organic sales growth despite rising input costs and margin pressure. By 2024, the pricing strategy had moderated, with net selling price increases of 4.1% contributing to 4.9% organic sales growth.

Organic sales (Net sales excluding, as applicable, the impact of foreign exchange, acquisitions and divestments), a non-GAAP financial measure as discussed below, increased 4.5% in 2021.\n\nNet sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment were $14,110 in 2021, up 4.0% from 2020, due to net selling price increases of 2.5% and positive foreign exchange of 1.5%, while volume was flat. Organic sales in the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment increased 2.5% in 2021.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was due to an increase in Oral Care organic sales, partially offset by a decrease in Personal Care organic sales. The increase in Oral Care was primarily due to organic sales growth in the toothpaste, manual toothbrush and mouthwash categories. The decrease in Personal Care was primarily due to organic sales declines in the liquid hand soap and bar soap categories.\n\nThe Company's share of the global toothpaste market was 39.4% for full year 2021, down 0.3 share points from full year 2020, and its share of the global manual toothbrush market was 30.9% for full year 2021, up 0.1 share points from full year 2020. Full year 2021 market shares in toothpaste were up in Europe and Africa/Eurasia and down in North America, Latin America and Asia Pacific versus full year 2020. In the manual toothbrush category, full year 2021 market shares were up in Latin America, Europe and Africa/Eurasia and down in North America and Asia Pacific versus full year 2020. For additional information regarding the Company's use of market share data and limitations of such data, see 'Market Share Information' below.\n\nNet sales for Hill's Pet Nutrition were $3,311 in 2021, an increase of 15.0% from 2020, driven by volume growth of 8.0%, net selling price increases of 5.5% and positive foreign exchange of 1.5%. Organic sales for Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 13.5% in 2021.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily due to increases in organic sales in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.",

Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## Net Sales\n\nWorldwide Net sales were $20,101 in 2024, up 3.3% from 2023, driven by volume growth of 3.1% and net selling price increases of 4.4%, partially offset by negative foreign exchange of 4.1%.

      "answer": "Colgate-Palmolive's working capital as a percentage of net sales fluctuated over the three-year period: it was 1.0% in 2022, decreased to -1.4% in 2023, and then dropped further to -5.2% in 2024. This trend indicates a growing negative working capital position, suggesting that the company increasingly financed its operations through trade payables and accruals rather than holding higher levels of current assets. The shift from positive to more negative working capital reflects improved cash flow generation in 2023 and especially in 2024, where higher accounts payable and accruals were leveraged to support operations without a proportional increase in current assets.",

        "Hop 1: [CL](2022) \u2192 Working Capital as Percentage of Net Sales: Working capital was 1.0% in 2022, indicating a positive balance of current assets over current liabilities.",
        "Hop 2: [CL](2023) \u2192 Working Capital as Percentage of Net Sales: Working capital decreased to -1.4% in 2023, showing a shift toward a more negative working capital position, driven by higher accounts payable and accruals and lower inventory.",
        "Hop 3: [CL](2024) \u2192 Working Capital as Percentage of Net Sales: Working capital dropped further to -5.2% in 2024, primarily due to higher accounts payable and accruals, signaling a stronger reliance on trade credit and improved cash flow management."

          "chunk_text": "## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nThe Company expects cash flow from operations and debt issuances will be sufficient to meet foreseeable business operating and recurring cash needs (including for debt service, dividends, capital expenditures, share repurchases and acquisitions). The Company believes its strong cash generation and financial position should continue to allow it broad access to global credit and capital markets.\n\n## Cash Flow\n\nNet cash provided by operations decreased to $3,325 in 2021 as compared to $3,719 in 2020, primarily due to changes in working capital. The Company's working capital as a percentage of Net sales was (2.7)% in 2021 and (4.4)% in 2020. This change in working capital as a percentage of Net sales is primarily due to lower accrued liabilities, partially offset by higher accounts payable and higher prepaid expenses. The Company defines working capital as the difference between current assets (excluding Cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, the latter of which is reported in Other current assets) and current liabilities (excluding shortterm debt).\n\nInvesting activities used $592 of cash in 2021 compared to $779 during 2020. Investing activities in 2020 included the acquisition of hello for cash consideration of $351 as part of the Company's continued strategy to focus on the high growth segments within its Oral Care, Personal Care and Pet Nutrition businesses. This acquisition was financed with a combination of debt and cash.\n\nCapital expenditures in the year ended December 31, 2021 were $567, an increase from $410 in 2020. Capital expenditures increased in 2021 primarily due to capacity expansion of manufacturing facilities and sustainability projects. Capital expenditures for 2022 are expected to be approximately 4.0% of Net sales. The Company continues to focus its capital spending on projects that are expected to yield high aftertax returns.\n\nFinancing activities used $2,774 of cash during 2021 compared to $2,919 during 2020. The decrease in cash used was primarily due to a decrease in net payments on debt, partially offset by higher share repurchases, net in 2021 as compared to 2020.\n\nIn 2020, as a result of the incremental debt related to recent acquisitions, net of proceeds from the exercise of stock options, the Company moderated its share repurchases, net. In addition, due to the initial uncertainties resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and our intent to preserve cash, the Company discontinued all share repurchases other than those pursuant to equity plans during the second quarter of 2020. The Company resumed its share repurchases, at a moderated level, net in the third quarter of 2020. Share repurchases, net returned to historical levels in 2021.\n\nLong-term debt, including the current portion, decreased to $7,206 as of December 31, 2021, as compared to $7,343 as of December 31, 2020, and total debt decreased to $7,245 as of December 31, 2021 as compared to $7,601 as of December 31, 2020. The Company's debt issuances and redemptions support the Company's capital structure objectives of funding its business and growth initiatives while minimizing its risk-adjusted cost of capital.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company issued \u20ac500 of eight-year notes at a fixed coupon rate of 0.300% (the 'Sustainability Bond'). The debt issuance was under the Company's shelf registration statement. An amount equal to the net proceeds of the Sustainability Bond will be used to finance or refinance, in part or in full, new and existing projects and programs with distinct environmental or social benefits pursuant to the Company's Sustainable Financing Framework.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed prior to maturity all of its outstanding 0.000% notes due 2021 with a principal amount of \u20ac500, originally issued on November 12, 2019. The redemption was financed with commercial paper borrowings. The redemption price was equal to the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.\n\nIn 1990, the Company's Canadian subsidiary ('CP Canada'), issued C$145 of Canadian dollar-denominated unsecured unsubordinated 12.85% guaranteed notes due October 4, 2030 (the 'Canada notes'). During the third quarter of 2021, CP Canada redeemed the Canada notes and recorded a loss on the early extinguishment of debt of $75, which is included in Interest (income) expense, net in the Consolidated Statements of Income, representing the difference between the redemption price and the carrying amount of the debt extinguished.",

      "answer": "From fiscal 2022 to 2024, Target's liability from unredeemed gift cards started at $1,202 million in 2022, decreased to $1,162 million in 2023, and then slightly increased to $1,209 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a relatively stable but fluctuating liability base, with a notable drop in 2023 followed by a rebound in 2024. The amount of gift cards issued during the period but not yet redeemed also declined over the three years \u2014 from $903 million in 2022 to $878 million in 2024 \u2014 suggesting a potential moderation in new gift card issuance. Meanwhile, revenue recognized from the beginning liability increased significantly in 2023 ($907 million) compared to 2022 ($736 million) and remained high in 2024 ($831 million), indicating higher redemption activity during these periods. Together, these trends suggest that while gift card issuance may have plateaued, Target experienced stronger redemption activity, which converted deferred liabilities into recognized revenue.",

      "question": "What was the trajectory of Target's consideration received from vendors as a component of cost management from 2022 through 2024, and how did its financial reporting treatment evolve across these years?",
      "answer": "Target consistently disclosed 'Consideration Received from Vendors' in its financial statements across the three years, but the reporting treatment evolved. In 2022, this item was disclosed in Note 6, appearing alongside cost of sales and SG&A in Note 5. By 2023, the consideration received from vendors was detailed in Note 5, immediately following cost of sales (Note 4), suggesting a closer alignment with direct cost reporting. In 2024, the consideration was reported in Note 4, directly adjacent to cost of sales, indicating a more integrated presentation. This evolution reflects a progressively tighter linkage between vendor considerations and core cost of sales over time, potentially signaling improved cost management strategies or enhanced transparency in procurement practices.",

      "answer": "Target's adjusted diluted earnings per share declined significantly from $13.56 in 2022 to $8.94 in 2023, representing a 34% drop, and then slightly decreased further to $8.86 in 2024, a 0.9% decline year-over-year.

      "answer": "From fiscal 2022 to 2024, Target's total retail square footage increased steadily from 243,284 thousand to 248,278 thousand square feet. In 2022, the total was 243,284 thousand square feet, rising to 245,939 thousand in 2023, and reaching 248,278 thousand in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by an increase in the 50,000 to 169,999 sq. ft. category, which expanded from 190,205 thousand square feet in 2022 to 195,050 thousand in 2024, as well as a rebound in the smallest store category (49,999 or less sq. ft.), which grew from 4,008 thousand in 2022 to 4,404 thousand in 2024. The largest store category (170,000+ sq. ft.) remained stable at around 48,824 thousand square feet across the three years.

      "question": "How did Target's disclosures regarding the timing and recognition of 'Consideration Received from Vendors' evolve across its 2022, 2023, and 2024 annual reports, and what does this reveal about the company's approach to vendor financing over the three-year period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Target disclosed 'Consideration Received from Vendors' as Note 6, indicating it was recognized after reporting revenues (Note 4) and cost of sales (Note 5). In 2023, the company moved the disclosure to Note 5, placing it ahead of advertising costs (Note 6) but after cost of sales (Note 4), suggesting a consistent but secondary treatment in the financial reporting sequence. By 2024, 'Consideration Received from Vendors' was disclosed as Note 4, now appearing before advertising costs (Note 5) and directly after cost of sales and SG&A (Note 3), which may signal a relatively more prominent role in the company's financial structure. While no specific dollar amounts are provided in the evidence, the sequential placement across years shows a gradual shift toward earlier recognition in the disclosure order, potentially reflecting a growing emphasis on vendor financing as part of Target's overall financial strategy.",

      "answer": "Target's food and beverage segment revenue increased from $22,918M in 2022 to $23,899M in 2023, representing a growth of $981M. In 2024, the segment revenue slightly declined to $23,828M, a decrease of $71M from 2023.

      "answer": "Across the three years, cigarette volume consistently negatively impacted PM's net revenue growth, with specific declines noted in 2022 (notably in the Czech Republic, France, and Germany), 2023 (partially offsetting HTU volume growth), and 2024 (continuing to offset gains from HTUs). In 2022, the decline in cigarette volume was partially offset by higher HTU and device volumes, especially in Germany and Italy, along with favorable pricing in combustible and heated tobacco products. In 2023, cigarette volume declines again offset some of the gains from HTU volume growth, which was strong enough to still yield an 11.2% underlying net revenue increase. In 2024, despite a 7.1% underlying revenue growth, cigarette volume remained a drag, and the pricing variance was further dampened by the German tax surcharge on HTPs, which PMI absorbed as a reduction in net revenues. This consistent downward pressure from cigarette volume highlights PM's strategic pivot toward HTUs and pricing adjustments to offset traditional product declines.",

Net revenues, excluding currency and acquisitions, increased by 7.1%, reflecting a favorable pricing variance, mainly driven by higher combustible tobacco pricing; and favorable volume/mix, primarily driven by higher HTU volume, partly offset by lower cigarette volume and adverse cigarette mix.\n\nThe pricing variance for 2023 and 2024 was negatively impacted by the supplemental tax surcharge on heated tobacco products (\"HTPs\") in G ermany, which went into effect in 2022. On March 14, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") ruled that the G erman fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. On May 15, 2024, following the decision issued by CJEU, the Fiscal Court in Dusseldorf (the \"FCD\") also ruled that the German fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. The FCD admitted an appeal to the Federal Tax Court. On June 19, 2024,  PMI submitted an appeal. The negative impact will continue, at least until the appeal ruling on the legality of the surcharge is concluded.  PMI currently accounts for the surcharge as a reduction in net revenues, with amounts withdrawn before May 15, 2024, currently under a payment suspension. Despite this payment suspension and, in order to avoid the future addition of interest, PMI elected, on January 14, 2025, to pay the amount outstanding of EUR 721 million (approximately $751 million), excluding accrued interest. An unfavorable outcome to the appeal would negatively impact PMI's future cash provided by operating activities for the amounts of unpaid interest. A favorable outcome to the appeal would positively impact future PMI's operating results and future cash provided by operating activities for the amounts paid in January 2025.",

We compete primarily on the basis of product quality, brand recognition, brand loyalty, taste, R&amp;D, innovation, packaging, customer service, marketing, advertising and retail price and, increasingly, adult smoker willingness to convert to our RRPs. In the combustible product category, we predominantly sell American blend cigarette brands, such as Marlboro , L&amp;M , Parliament, Philip Morris and Chesterfield , which are the most popular across many of our markets. In the RRP product category, we predominantly sell Platform 1 devices and heated tobacco units under the IQOS brand  umbrella. We seek to compete in all profitable retail price categories, although our brand portfolio is weighted towards the premium-price category.\n\nThe  competitive  environment  and  our  competitive  position  can  be  significantly  influenced  by  weak  economic  conditions,  erosion  of consumer  confidence,  competitors'  introduction  of  lower-price  products  or  innovative  products,  higher  tobacco  product  taxes,  higher absolute prices and larger gaps between retail price categories, and product regulation that diminishes the ability to differentiate tobacco products  and  restricts  adult  consumer  access  to  truthful  and  non-misleading  information  about  our  RRPs.  Competitors  in  our  industry include three large international tobacco companies, new market entrants, particularly with respect to innovative products, several regional and  local  tobacco  companies  and,  in  some  instances,  state-owned  tobacco  enterprises,  principally  in Algeria,  Egypt,  the  PRC,  Taiwan, Thailand  and  Vietnam.  Certain  new  market  entrants  in  the  non-combustible  product  category  may  alienate  consumers  from  innovative products  through  inappropriate  marketing  campaigns,  messaging  and  inferior  product  satisfaction,  while  not  relying  on  scientific substantiation based on appropriate R&amp;D protocols and standards. The growing use of digital media could increase the speed and extent of the  dissemination  of  inaccurate  and  misleading  information  about  our  RRPs,  all  of  which  could  have  a  mutual  adverse  effect  on  our profitability and results of operations.\n\n## Procurement and Raw Materials\n\nWe purchase tobacco leaf of various types, grades and styles throughout the world, mostly through independent tobacco suppliers. In 2021, we also contracted directly with farmers in several countries, including Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Italy, Pakistan and Poland. In 2021, direct sourcing from farmers represented approximately 25% of PMI's global leaf requirements. The largest supplies of tobacco leaf are sourced from Argentina, Brazil, China, Italy, Indonesia (mostly for domestic use in kretek products), Malawi, Mozambique, the Philippines, Turkey and the United States.\n\nWe  believe  that  there  is  an  adequate  supply  of  tobacco  leaf  in  the  world  markets  to  satisfy  our  current  and  anticipated  production requirements.",

      "question": "How did Philip Morris International's total shipment volume evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trajectory reveal about the company's strategic shift toward heated tobacco units and its regional market dynamics, particularly in South and Southeast Asia?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Philip Morris International's total shipment volume underwent a notable transformation. In 2022, total shipment volume decreased by 1.8% to 142.2 billion units, primarily driven by declines in the Philippines and Thailand, with the Philippines experiencing a 17.6% drop due to lower total market and reduced market share. In 2023, total shipment volume increased by 1.0% to 738.2 billion units, with heated tobacco units (HTUs) rising to 125.3 billion units, up from 109.2 billion in 2022. By 2024, total shipment volume grew further by 2.5% to 756.6 billion units, with HTUs reaching 139.7 billion units, indicating a sustained strategic pivot toward smoke-free products. This shift was supported by Marlboro's 3.7% shipment growth in 2024, and the integration of Swedish Match in 2023, which bolstered the company's nicotine pouch portfolio. Regionally, the South and Southeast Asia market grew significantly in 2022, with PMI\u2019s market share declining slightly, suggesting a need for strategic adjustments that likely contributed to the broader global reorganization and focus on HTUs in 2023 and 2024.",

      "question": "How did Altria's (PM) 'Accrued Liabilities - Other' evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the 3-year trajectory reveal about the company's short-term obligations management?",
      "answer": "Altria's 'Accrued Liabilities - Other' fluctuated over the three-year period: it was $178 million in 2022, increased to $197 million in 2023, and then slightly declined to $177 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a short-term increase in obligations in 2023, followed by a partial reversal in 2024, suggesting dynamic liability management in response to operational or strategic shifts.",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, Costco consistently noted that its paid membership growth rate was adversely impacted when warehouse openings occurred in existing markets rather than new ones. In 2022, the company highlighted that this negative impact was a continuing factor but declining in significance as warehouse expansion matured. By 2023, this trend persisted, with the company noting that cannibalization effects from existing market openings remained a headwind to membership growth. In 2024, the company reiterated the same concern and added that worldwide renewal rates could also be negatively affected by lower renewal rates in newer markets, compounding the challenge. This 3-year consistency in reporting the same risk factor suggests that warehouse expansion in existing markets remains a structural constraint to membership growth, revealing a potential limit to the scalability of Costco\u2019s membership model without corresponding member acquisition in new geographies.",

Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings  occur  in  existing  markets,  are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  warehouse  operations.  E-commerce  sales  growth  slowed  in  2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this  area,  some  significant  costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry  average  for  much  of  our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&amp;A  expenses,  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International  segment  have  relatively  higher  rates  of  square  footage  growth,  lower  wage  and  benefit  costs  as  a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\n\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal  years  ended  August  28,  2022,  August  29,  2021,  and  August  30,  2020,  respectively.

      "question": "How did Costco's approach to SKU management in its core merchandise categories evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year trend suggest about its inventory strategy?",
      "answer": "Costco maintained a consistent focus on limited SKU offerings in its core warehouse business across all three years, but with subtle shifts in online availability. In 2022, Costco reported carrying less than 4,000 active SKUs per warehouse in its core business, with approximately 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs available online. By 2024, this core warehouse SKU count remained below 4,000, but online SKUs had decreased slightly to 9,000 to 10,000. The 2023 filing emphasized revenue recognition practices across these core categories (foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh foods), indicating continued operational focus on these segments. The stability in core warehouse SKUs demonstrates a consistent strategy of operational efficiency, while the slight reduction in online SKUs from 2022 to 2024 suggests a potential refinement rather than expansion of its e-commerce assortment. This evolution indicates a measured approach to maintaining its warehouse model's efficiency while selectively expanding digital offerings.",

Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary storedvalue card (shop card).\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses.

The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.\n\nOur  other  businesses  sell  products  and  services  that  complement  our  warehouse  operations  (core  and  warehouse ancillary businesses).

      "answer": "Across the three years, Costco's gasoline business \u2014 a key warehouse ancillary service \u2014 saw its contribution to total net sales decline slightly from 14% in 2022 to 12% in both 2023 and 2024. Despite this modest drop, the number of gas stations operated by Costco increased from 668 in 2022 to 719 by the end of 2024, suggesting continued investment in this ancillary service. This trend indicates that while the gasoline business remains a significant part of Costco's warehouse ancillary offerings, its relative revenue contribution has slightly decreased, potentially signaling a strategic shift or a response to external market conditions such as fluctuating fuel prices or member purchasing behavior. The persistence in expanding the number of gas stations implies a strategic intent to use ancillary services to drive foot traffic and member engagement, even if the sales percentage has softened.",

Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary storedvalue card (shop card).\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\n\nIn keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n## Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n\n- Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)\n- Non-Foods (including  major  appliances,  electronics,  health  and  beauty  aids,  hardware,  garden  and  patio, sporting  goods,  tires,  toys  and  seasonal,  office  supplies,  automotive  care,  postage,  tickets,  apparel,  small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n- Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\n\nWarehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\n\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.\n\nOur  other  businesses  sell  products  and  services  that  complement  our  warehouse  operations  (core  and  warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  represented  approximately  7%  of  total  net  sales  in  2022.  This  figure  does  not include  other  services  we  offer  online  in  certain  countries  such  as  business  delivery,  travel,  same-day  grocery,  and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries.

      "answer": "Costco's membership growth rate faced consistent challenges across 2022 to 2024 due to its warehouse expansion strategy, particularly in existing markets. In 2022, the company noted that warehouse openings in existing markets had a negative impact on the paid membership growth rate, as new locations competed with existing ones rather than expanding the overall member base. In 2023, this concern persisted, with the company explicitly stating that membership growth was adversely impacted when warehouses opened in existing markets, and that renewal rates were also affected in newer markets. By 2024, the issue remained unchanged, with the company reiterating that paid membership growth continued to be negatively impacted by warehouse openings in existing markets. This consistent pattern reveals that Costco faces diminishing returns when expanding within existing markets, suggesting that future growth may increasingly depend on international expansion or enhancing value for current members rather than geographic density.",

Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings  occur  in  existing  markets,  are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  warehouse  operations.  E-commerce  sales  growth  slowed  in  2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this  area,  some  significant  costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry  average  for  much  of  our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&amp;A  expenses,  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International  segment  have  relatively  higher  rates  of  square  footage  growth,  lower  wage  and  benefit  costs  as  a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\n\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31. References to 2022, 2021, and 2020 relate to the 52-week fiscal  years  ended  August  28,  2022,  August  29,  2021,  and  August  30,  2020,  respectively.  Certain  percentages presented are calculated using actual results prior to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, references to net income relate to net income attributable to Costco.",
