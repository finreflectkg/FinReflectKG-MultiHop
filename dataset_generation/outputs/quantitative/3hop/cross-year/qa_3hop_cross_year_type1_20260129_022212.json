      "question": "How did the increase in META's Reality Labs segment costs from 2023 to 2024 impact the company's overall cost structure, and what does this suggest about their investment strategy in VR technology?",
      "answer": "In 2023, META's Reality Labs segment reported costs and expenses of $18,016 million, which increased to $19,875 million in 2024, representing a 10% year-over-year growth. This increase in costs for the VR segment was part of a broader trend where META's total costs and expenses rose from $88,151 million in 2023 to $95,121 million in 2024, a 8% increase. The disproportionate growth in Reality Labs costs compared to the overall cost structure suggests that META intensified its investment in VR technology during this period, despite the segment's ongoing operating losses. This aligns with the company's long-term strategic focus on building the metaverse, even at the expense of near-term profitability in this division.",

      "answer": "In 2022, T reported $4,592 in vendor financing payables included within 'Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities,' indicating a significant portion of short-term obligations tied to vendor financing arrangements. By 2023, this figure dropped to $1,975, signaling a strategic reduction in such liabilities. This decrease suggests T may have restructured or paid down vendor-related financing, potentially improving liquidity or shifting toward alternative financing mechanisms. The evolution of this entity chain shows a deliberate move to reduce reliance on vendor financing within short-term liabilities, aligning with broader balance sheet optimization efforts.",

The guarantee obligation at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $371 and $228, respectively, of which $101 and $161 are included in 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities' on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in 'Other noncurrent liabilities.' Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the total amount of our deferred purchase price and guarantee obligation.\n\n## Revolving Receivables Program\n\nWe have a revolving agreement to transfer up to $6,680 of certain receivables (primarily from WarnerMedia) through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. This agreement is subject to renewal on an annual basis and the transfer limit may be expanded or reduced from time to time. As customers pay their balances, we transfer additional receivables into the program, resulting in our gross receivables sold exceeding net cash flow impacts (e.g., collect and reinvest). The transferred receivables are fully guaranteed by our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries, which hold additional receivables in the amount of $3,527 that are pledged as collateral under this agreement. The transfers are recorded at fair value of the proceeds received and obligations assumed less derecognized receivables. The obligation is subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated expected credit losses and interest rates. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these receivables transferred is limited to the amount outstanding.\n\nThe fair value measurement used for the obligation is considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 13).\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of receivables sold:\n\n",

Weak economic conditions in  the  United  States,  in  Europe  or  globally  could  adversely  affect  demand  for  any  of  our  products  and  services  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.  In  particular,  the  success  of  our  theme  parks  and  theatrical  releases  largely  depends  on  consumer  demand  for  out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  make  acquisitions  and  investments  and  may  pursue  other  strategic  initiatives,  such  as  the  proposed  Spin-off.  In  connection  with  such acquisitions  and  strategic  initiatives,  we  may  incur  significant  or  unanticipated  ex penses,  fail  to  realize  anticipated  benefits  and  synergies,  have  difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2023, VZ reorganized its Business segment, consolidating customer groups but retaining Wholesale as a distinct unit. This reorganization maintained Wholesale's focus on providing wireline communications services to carriers. However, in 2024, Wholesale revenues declined, driven by a $117 million drop in traditional voice communication and network connectivity due to technology substitution and reduced core data demand. Despite the structural stability provided by the 2023 reorganization, market forces negatively impacted Wholesale's performance in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AT&T reported $3,085 million in Operations and Support Expenses allocated to Latin America - Mexico, which was part of a broader Latin America segment that included Vrio and other operations. By 2024, this figure decreased to $2,812 million specifically for Latin America - Mexico, indicating a more focused cost structure. Despite lower expenses, the operating loss for Latin America - Mexico widened from $(718) million in 2022 to $(326) million in 2024. This suggests that while AT&T reduced its cost base, the segment still faced challenges in achieving profitability, potentially due to continued market pressures or strategic investments in the region.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GOOGL experienced a $3.5 billion increase in compensation expenses, which significantly contributed to rising costs across its segments, including Google Cloud. This expense pressure was a key factor in the Cloud segment's operating loss, which, although reduced compared to prior years, still represented a major financial drag. By the end of 2023, Google Cloud reported a balance of $7.199 billion, indicating continued investment and growth in the segment despite earlier cost challenges. The evolution from cost-driven operating losses in 2022 to a more stable financial position in 2023 suggests strategic adjustments in cost management and scaling of cloud operations.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney's Linear Networks planned to produce over 270 original programs, most of which were intended for distribution on Linear Networks and DTC platforms. This content strategy was designed to maintain relevance in a competitive landscape where affiliate fees were a key revenue driver. By 2024, the Entertainment segment explicitly described affiliate fees as a core revenue stream, derived from multi-channel video programming distributors (MVPDs) and affiliated ABC stations. The 2024 disclosures also emphasized the international expansion of Linear Networks, including Disney, FX, and Star-branded channels, which likely contributed to a broader and more diversified affiliate fee base. This evolution suggests that the increased investment in original and international content between 2022 and 2024 was strategically aligned with enhancing affiliate fee revenue through expanded distribution and carriage agreements.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

By 2023, the projected benefit obligations for postretirement medical plans showed a multi-year outlook with increasing obligations: $51 million in 2025, rising to $62 million in 2029, and totaling $335 million for 2030\u20132034.

      "answer": "T's Operating Revenues declined from $2,607M in 2022 to an unspecified but clearly lower level by 2024, driven in part by the Business Wireline segment's reduced demand for legacy services and product simplification. This decline was further exacerbated by the absence of cybersecurity revenues, which were spun off into LevelBlue. By 2024, the Business Wireline segment was under significant financial pressure, evidenced by its nonrecurring fair value measurement using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches, indicating impairment risk and strategic reevaluation.

The Media segment's relationship with distribution revenue is driven by fees received from internal segments like Cable Communications, as outlined in the intersegment revenue recognition policies. Despite slight growth in distribution fees, the broader Media revenue contraction suggests that the incremental domestic distribution gains were insufficient to offset declines elsewhere in the Media portfolio.",

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\n\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\n\n",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA's Media segment recognized revenue from intersegment licenses of content from Studios to Media at a point in time, while the associated costs were recognized over the license period, resulting in a timing difference that impacted Adjusted EBITDA through eliminations. This same pattern persisted into 2024, where the Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment continued to pay fees to Media for the rights to distribute television programming, maintaining the same revenue and cost recognition timing mismatch. The consistency in this intersegment structure across both years suggests that the Adjusted EBITDA impact due to these timing differences remained structurally similar, though the specific deferred profit amounts may have varied depending on the volume and timing of licensed content used by Media in each year.",

The costs of these licenses in Media are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition betw een segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period.\n\n(b) Includes the operations of our S ky-branded video services and television netw orks in G ermany; C omcast S pectacor, w hich ow ns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo C enter arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; and Xumo, our consolidated streaming platform joint venture w ith Charter Communications.

      "question": "How did the relationship between AT&T's Operations and Support Expenses and its Business Wireline segment evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in terms of expense allocation and strategic valuation treatment?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T reported $14,217 million in Operations and Support Expenses for the Business Wireline segment, which contributed $20,883 million in revenue. By 2024, these expenses increased to $14,934 million, while Business Wireline revenue rose to $22,538 million. This indicates a continued cost-heavy investment in the segment. Furthermore, in 2024, Business Wireline was explicitly included in nonrecurring fair value measurements using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches, signaling heightened strategic scrutiny. This evolution shows that despite a slight increase in both revenue and expenses, the segment was subjected to deeper valuation analysis, potentially reflecting concerns over its long-term viability or strategic fit.",

      "answer": "In 2023, META's Income from Operations was $46.8 billion, which increased to $69.4 billion in 2024. This growth was primarily driven by the Family of Apps segment, whose Income from Operations rose from $62.9 billion in 2023 to $87.1 billion in 2024. The segment's revenue also increased from $133.0 billion to $162.4 billion during this period, while its total costs and expenses grew from $69.1 billion to $75.3 billion. This indicates that the Family of Apps maintained strong revenue growth and contributed significantly to the overall improvement in META\u2019s profitability, despite rising operational costs.",

      "question": "How did the performance of T's Mobility segment in 2022, which showed 7.8% year-over-year revenue growth, relate to the company's overall operating revenues in 2023, which increased by only 1.4% year-over-year despite significant declines in service revenue growth?",
      "answer": "In 2022, T's Mobility segment showed strong revenue growth of 7.8% year-over-year, reaching $78,254 million, indicating a positive trajectory for one of its core business units. However, by 2023, the company's overall operating revenues only grew by 1.4% year-over-year to $122,428 million, with service revenue growth slowing to just 1.9%. This suggests that while the Mobility segment remained a strong contributor, broader challenges in service revenue growth and potentially flat or declining performance in other segments offset the momentum from Mobility, resulting in a much more muted overall revenue performance in 2023 compared to the prior year.",

        "Hop 1: T(2022) \u2192 Mobility: Mobility segment revenue grew by 7.8% to $78,254 million in 2022, indicating strong performance.",

        "Hop 3: Operating Revenues \u2190 T(2023): In 2023, total operating revenues grew only 1.4% year-over-year to $122,428 million, with service revenue growth at just 1.9%."

      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA's Studios segment experienced reduced content licensing revenue due to the WGA and SAG work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively. This disruption led to lower content availability for internal licensing to the Media segment. In 2024, this translated into reduced programming and production costs at the Media segment, as fewer original productions were available due to the earlier labor disruptions. Despite these cost reductions, the Media segment continued to face declining linear television subscribers and ratings, which the company aimed to offset through growth in Peacock's paid subscribers and advertising revenue. The Studios-to-Media licensing dynamic in 2024 remained impacted by the prior year\u2019s production delays, affecting content availability and thus influencing both segments\u2019 financial performance.",

We expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear television networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in paid subscribers and advertising revenue at Peacock. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to content and marketing at Peacock. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Olympics in the third quarter of 2024 and our acquisition of NBA rights, which begin in 2025.\n\nOur Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content &amp; Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. The Writers G uild and the SAG  work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively, resulted in reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment and reduced programming and production costs at both our Studios and Media segments in 2023.\n\nWe continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which we expect will open in May 2025, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2023, GOOGL's Cost of Revenues increased by 6% year-over-year, driven in part by rising TAC payments to distribution partners such as browser providers and mobile carriers. TAC is explicitly defined in 2024 documentation as a core component of Cost of Revenues, directly tied to ad placements on Google Network properties and search access points. By 2024, this dependency on TAC had a measurable impact on Google Services' operating income, which saw a $25.4 billion increase year-over-year\u2014partially offset by continued growth in both content acquisition costs and TAC.

T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nFluctuations in our  Google  Cloud rev enues hav e been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of rev enues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and  marketing,  and  general  and  administrativ e  functions.  Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

By 2024, the Entertainment segment explicitly called out 'Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)' as a distinct component of Programming and Production Costs, while the Sports segment continued to emphasize 'production costs related to live sports and other sports-related programming.'

      "answer": "In 2023, VZ reorganized its Business segment by consolidating customer groups, merging Global Enterprise and Public Sector into a single unit. This structural change was intended to streamline operations and improve service delivery. However, in 2024, the Business segment's operating revenues declined by $591 million (2.0%) to $29.5 billion, despite the Enterprise and Public Sector group contributing $15,692 million in external operating revenues. This suggests that while the reorganization may have improved alignment, it did not prevent an overall revenue decline in the Business segment, potentially indicating market or competitive pressures.",

        "Hop 1: VZ(2023) \u2192 Business Segment: VZ reorganized the Business segment in Q1 2023, merging four customer groups into three, including the consolidation of Global Enterprise and Public Sector into a single unit.",

Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the V erizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE networks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our V erizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.\n\nCustomers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches.\n\nIn addition to wireless services and equipment for retail customers, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis.\n\nThe Consumer segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $102.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 1.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Consumer segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Verizon Business G roup\n\nOur  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  FWA   broadband,  data,  video  and  advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world.\n\nThe Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $29.5 billion, a decrease of $591 million, or 2.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Business segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nCorporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support our  strategic  initiativ es,  as  well  as  unallocated  corporate  ex penses,  certain  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  related  costs  and  interest  and  financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated or used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. A lthough such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results and therefore are included in the chief operating decision maker's assessment of segment performance.

      "answer": "The increase in tax incentives from $719 million in 2022 to $899 million in 2024 led to a corresponding rise in the reduction of content amortization costs over the life of titles. This contributed to content amortization growing at a slower rate\u2014from $14,026 million in 2022 to $15,301 million in 2024\u2014despite Netflix\u2019s expanding content library. The data suggests that Netflix\u2019s strategy of leveraging tax incentives on qualified production spend helped moderate the financial impact of content amortization, supporting higher-margin growth as operating margins rose from 18% in 2022 to 27% in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NFLX(2023) \u2192 Tax Incentives: Tax incentives in 2023 were $835 million, reducing the cost basis of content assets and lowering amortization.",

      "question": "How did the change in Disney's Postretirement Medical Plan obligations from 2022 to 2023 influence the Net Actuarial Loss position, and what does this reveal about the long-term sustainability of their postretirement benefits strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney reported a Net Actuarial Loss of $93 million related to its Postretirement Medical Plans, which improved from a $13 million actuarial loss in the prior year (2021). By 2023, this position had worsened to a Net Actuarial Loss of $190 million. This deterioration occurred despite a reduction in the projected benefit obligations for Postretirement Medical Plans, which fell from $2,121 million in 2021 to $1,539 million in 2022, and further to an unspecified lower amount in 2023. The worsening Net Actuarial Loss suggests that assumptions or market factors\u2014such as healthcare cost trends or discount rate changes\u2014negatively impacted the funded status of these plans, even as the company reduced its formal obligations. This indicates potential long-term risk in Disney\u2019s postretirement benefits strategy, as increasing actuarial losses could lead to higher future expenses or require additional contributions to maintain plan solvency.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS(2022) \u2192 Postretirement Medical Plans: In 2022, Disney disclosed a projected benefit obligation of $1,539 million for Postretirement Medical Plans, down from $2,121 million in 2021.",
        "Hop 2: Postretirement Medical Plans \u2192 Net Actuarial Loss: The 2022 Net Actuarial Loss for these plans was $93 million, showing an improvement from the previous year.",
        "Hop 3: Net Actuarial Loss \u2190 DIS(2023): By 2023, the Net Actuarial Loss had increased to $190 million, indicating a reversal in the earlier favorable trend."

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Theme Parks segment reported a dramatic recovery, with Adjusted EBITDA increasing from $(0.5) billion in 2021 to $1.3 billion, driven by the reopening of parks post-pandemic and the launch of the Beijing theme park. This turnaround marked a significant shift in the segment's contribution to the company's financial health. By 2024, the company continued to disclose Adjusted EBITDA as the primary performance metric across all segments, including Theme Parks, which now contributed positively to consolidated results. The 2024 disclosures also highlighted that intersegment revenue treatments\u2014such as content licensing and distribution fees\u2014had a deferring impact on EBITDA recognition between segments, further shaping how Theme Parks' improved performance was reflected in the consolidated financial statements. This evolution shows how the segment's recovery not only boosted EBITDA directly but also influenced broader financial reporting dynamics within the company.",

Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, revenue in the Media segment increased 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n- Media segment results include the operations of Peacock, which in 2021 generated revenue of $778 million and operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion, compared to revenue of $118 million and operating costs and expenses of $781 million in 2020. We continued to invest in content and grow our customer base during 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced certain ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n- Studios segment revenue increased 16.2% to $9.4 billion, due to increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue and  home  entertainment  and  other  revenue  as  our  film  and  television  production  operations  returned  to  full  capacity. Studios revenue included licenses of content to our Media and other segments, including the impact of a new licensing agreement  for  content  that  became  exclusively  available  for  streaming  on  Peacock  in  2021,  and  the  impacts  of  initial content licenses associated with the launch of Peacock in 2020, which are eliminated in consolidation.\n- Theme Parks segment revenue increased 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the operation of our theme parks in the current year period compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period and the opening of our theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\n- Revenue increased 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue increased 3.1% due to increases  in  advertising  and  direct-to-consumer  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  content  revenue,  which  were affected by COVID-19 in the prior year period and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period.\n- Adjusted  EBITDA increased  20.8%  to  $2.4  billion.  Excluding  the  impact  of  foreign  currency,  Sky Adjusted  EBITDA increased 10.2% primarily due to increases in revenue and decreases in programming and production expenses, partially offset by increases in direct network costs and other expenses.\n\n## Other\n\n- Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA losses decreased from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year period in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses.\n- Resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021. We repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion in 2021. Raised our dividend by $0.08 to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis in January 2021 and paid $4.5 billion of dividends in 2021.\n- Reduced debt by $8.9 billion in 2021 and ended the year with $94.8 billion of total short-term and long-term debt and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Impacts of COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways, with the most significant effects in 2020, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively.

These incentives directly reduce the cost basis of content assets, which in turn lowers content amortization expenses over the life of the titles.

Business\n\n## ABOUT US\n\nNetflix, Inc. ('Netflix', 'the Company', 'registrant', 'we', or 'us') is one of the world's leading entertainment services with approximately 222 million paid memberships in over 190 countries enjoying TV series, documentaries, feature films and mobile games across a wide variety of genres and languages. Members can engage as much as they want, anytime, anywhere, on any internetconnected screen. Members can play, pause and resume watching, all without commercials. Additionally, we continue to offer our DVD-by-mail service in the United States ('U.S.').\n\nWe are a pioneer in the delivery of streaming entertainment, launching our streaming service in 2007. Since this launch, we have developed an ecosystem for internet-connected screens and have added increasing amounts of content that enable consumers to enjoy entertainment directly on their internet-connected screens. As a result of these efforts, we have experienced growing consumer acceptance of, and interest in, the delivery of streaming entertainment.\n\nOur core strategy is to grow our streaming membership business globally within the parameters of our operating margin target. We are continuously improving our members' experience by expanding our content with a focus on a programming mix of content that delights our members and attracts new members. For example, in 2021 we added mobile games to our service. In addition, we are continuously enhancing our user interface and extending our streaming service to more internet-connected screens. Our members can download a selection of titles for offline viewing.\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe operate as one operating segment. Our revenues are primarily derived from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members. See Note 12, Segment and Geographic Information , in the accompanying notes to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n\n## COMPETITION\n\nThe market for video entertainment is intensely competitive and subject to rapid change. We compete against other entertainment video providers, such as multichannel video programming distributors ('MVPDs'), streaming entertainment providers (including those that provide pirated content), video gaming providers and more broadly against other sources of entertainment that our members could choose in their moments of free time. We also compete against streaming entertainment providers and content producers in obtaining content for our service, both for licensed content and for original content projects.\n\nWhile consumers may maintain simultaneous relationships with multiple entertainment sources, we strive for consumers to choose us in their moments of free time. We have often referred to this choice as our objective of \"winning moments of",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney reported Licensed Programming Rights of $13.4B, which included amortization of intangibles and subscriber-based fees across their entertainment platforms. By 2024, this figure increased to $14.0B, reflecting a $600M rise. This increase in Licensed Programming Rights fed directly into Programming and Production Costs, which also saw a year-over-year increase from $13.96B in 2023 to $14.08B in 2024. The evolution of this chain suggests that higher licensed content investments contributed to the upward trend in overall programming and production expenses, particularly in platforms like Hulu and Disney+.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "question": "How did the growth in Google Cloud's operating income from 2022 to 2024 interact with changes in employee compensation expenses, particularly given the $4.4 billion increase in Cloud operating income driven by headcount-related compensation costs in 2024?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Google Cloud's operating income grew significantly, with a $4.4 billion increase in 2024 alone. This growth was primarily driven by higher revenues, but it was partially offset by rising employee compensation expenses, which were largely attributed to headcount growth. While the 2022 report emphasized Google Cloud as a strategic growth area and part of the company's expanding non-advertising revenue stream, the 2024 results show that this expansion came with increased labor costs. However, in contrast to Google Cloud, Google Services saw a reduction in employee compensation expenses, which contributed to its larger $25.4 billion increase in operating income. This contrast reveals a strategic trade-off: Google prioritized investment in human capital within Cloud to fuel growth, while managing or reducing compensation costs elsewhere.",

While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "In 2022, Google Cloud reported an operating loss of $1.9 billion, with operating expenses significantly impacted by headcount growth, which was also a key driver of increased operating costs at the company level. By 2023, Google Cloud turned profitable with an operating income of $1.7 billion, a $3.6 billion improvement year-over-year. This turnaround was primarily driven by a significant increase in revenues, which outpaced cost growth, including compensation expenses still influenced by headcount expansion. Additionally, cost reductions from changes in the estimated useful lives of servers and network equipment further supported profitability. Despite ongoing headcount-related expenses, Google Cloud's revenue growth and cost optimization measures enabled the segment to transition from a loss-making unit to a profitable one in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney disclosed a DPEP segment balance of $5,550 million, consistent across both fiscal years. However, in 2024, the company explicitly included 'charges for room nights at hotels' as part of its 'significant service revenues' in the consolidated reporting, indicating a more pronounced focus on hotel room nights as a key performance indicator. While the DPEP segment balance did not change, the 2024 disclosures placed greater emphasis on hotel room nights as a distinct revenue stream within the broader DPEP segment, reflecting a potential shift in how Disney is tracking and reporting resort-based performance metrics.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

The fiscal 2023 presentation has been adjusted to conform with the fiscal 2024 presentation. (1)\n\n## 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Walt Disney Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.\n\n## Reporting Period\n\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were fifty-two week years.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2024 presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games",

According to the 2023 filing, amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The significant decline in amortization costs suggests a potential shift in how Disney is valuing or distributing its content across these windows, possibly reflecting a strategic recalibration in content investment or a change in the relative importance of different distribution channels such as theatrical, TV/VOD, or streaming platforms like Disney+ and Hulu.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T's Consumer Wireline segment reported $9,053 million in Operations and Support Expenses, which slightly decreased to $8,946 million in 2024. Despite this marginal reduction, the 2024 10-K filing reveals that the Consumer Wireline segment was subjected to nonrecurring fair value measurements using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches, signaling increased scrutiny of the segment's valuation and potential strategic repositioning. This implies that while cost control remained a focus, the company may be evaluating long-term strategic options for the segment, as evidenced by the fair value assessment alongside the expense tracking.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney reported a Postretirement Medical Plan obligation of $1,539 million with a Net Actuarial Loss of $595 million. By 2024, the Postretirement Medical Plan obligation decreased, and the Net Actuarial Loss was $190 million. This significant reduction in Net Actuarial Loss indicates that the assumptions used to calculate long-term liabilities for postretirement medical benefits became more favorable or stable between 2022 and 2024, reducing the gap between projected and actual outcomes. The connection between the Postretirement Medical Plans and Net Actuarial Loss is evident in how changes in plan obligations directly impact the AOCI, reflecting shifts in liability estimates over time.",

      "answer": "Disney's total contributions decreased from $615 million in 2023 to $591 million in 2024, a reduction of $24 million. This decrease in total contributions was partially attributed to a decline in pension plan contributions, which fell from $316 million in 2023 to $291 million in 2024. Meanwhile, health and welfare plan contributions remained nearly unchanged at $299 million in 2023 and $300 million in 2024. As a result, the proportion of total contributions allocated to health and welfare plans increased slightly, indicating that the company maintained its commitment to these plans even as overall benefit contributions declined. This shift suggests a reallocation of benefit spending toward health and welfare at the expense of pension contributions.",

This indicates that the cost increases, particularly in operations and support expenses ($49.770 billion in 2024) and depreciation and amortization ($8.198 billion in 2024), outpaced the benefits from higher Mobility revenues.

      "answer": "In 2023, VZ reorganized its Business segment by combining Commercial Wireline Customers into the newly formed Enterprise and Public Sector group, which was previously part of Small and Medium Business. This strategic move aimed to better align customer segments and streamline service delivery. By 2024, the Enterprise and Public Sector segment reported $14.2 billion in revenues, accounting for 48% of the Business segment's total revenues. This indicates a successful integration and growth trajectory. Furthermore, the segment expanded its offerings to include a broader portfolio of connectivity, security, and professional services tailored to large businesses and public sector entities, such as private networking, cloud connectivity, and unified communications. These developments suggest that the 2023 reorganization enabled VZ to more effectively target enterprise customers with comprehensive, customized solutions in 2024.",

Customers that activate service on devices purchased under the device payment program generally pay lower service fees as compared to those under our fixed-term service plans, and their device payment plan charge is included on their wireless monthly bill. While we no longer offer Consumer customers fixed-term subsidized service plans for devices, we continue to offer subsidized plans to our Business customers.

      "question": "How did the restructuring of service credits in 2023 affect Mobility's reported operations and support expenses, and how does this compare to the actual expense levels seen in 2024 financial reporting?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T restructured its reporting by removing prior service credits from segment operating expenses, which increased Communications segment operations and support expenses by approximately $2,400 in 2022 and $2,100 in 2021. This recast specifically impacted how Mobility's expenses were presented historically. In 2024 financial reporting, Mobility's operations and support expenses were disclosed at $49,770. The restructuring means that 2023's restated figures are not directly comparable to 2024's reported expenses, as the earlier years absorbed lower expenses due to service credits that were later reclassified to other income in consolidated reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: T(2023) \u2192 Mobility: AT&T restructured its reporting methodology in Q1 2023, removing prior service credits from Mobility's historical operations and support expense reporting, increasing 2022 expenses by $2,400 and 2021 by $2,100.",
        "Hop 2: Mobility \u2192 Operations and Support Expenses: Mobility's operations and support expenses were a key financial metric disclosed in both restated historical reporting and current financial statements.",

      "question": "How did the Latin America segment's contribution to total segment operating revenues change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this imply about its relative strategic importance within T's business portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Latin America segment accounted for approximately 3% of T's total segment operating revenues, contributing around $3,662 million at the start of the year, but this value declined to $836 million by the end of the year due to impairments and currency exchange effects. In 2023, the Latin America segment continued to represent about 3% of total segment operating revenues, indicating a stable proportional contribution. However, T's total segment operating revenues increased from $117,067 million in 2022 to $118,038 million in 2023, meaning the absolute dollar value tied to Latin America likely remained modest despite the overall growth. This suggests that the Latin America segment maintained a minor role in the broader revenue mix during this period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: T(2022) \u2192 Latin America Segment: T reported that the Latin America segment contributed $3,662 million at the beginning of 2022, declining to $836 million by year-end due to impairments and currency exchange effects.",
        "Hop 2: Latin America Segment \u2192 Total Segment Operating Revenues: The Latin America segment consistently accounted for approximately 3% of T's total segment operating revenues in both 2022 and 2023.",

Despite this cost growth, the segment's operating income improved significantly, moving from a loss of $141 million in 2023 to a profit of $40 million in 2024. This turnaround occurred even as AT&T maintained its stake in the region, suggesting that revenue growth (up 7.6% from $3,932 million to $4,232 million) and lower depreciation costs ($724 million to $657 million) helped offset rising operational expenses and contributed to the improved profitability.",

By 2024, this revenue stream faced downward pressure due to increased competition, which constrained pricing power and limited growth potential. The 2024 filings explicitly stated that competition reduced or limited growth in prices for subscription services, including those at linear networks and DTC offerings. This implies that despite efforts to maintain or grow revenue, the Sports Segment's subscription fee income likely stagnated or declined in 2024 compared to 2023, reflecting the broader trend of competitive pressures directly impacting Disney's ability to raise subscription fees.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Increased competitive pressures impact our revenues, increase our costs and impact the profitability of our businesses.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

      "answer": "In 2023, DIS reported operating labor costs of $7,550 million, which increased by 11% to $8,392 million in 2024. This significant rise in labor costs directly affected the Experiences segment, which lists operating labor as one of its significant expenses. Given the segment's reliance on labor for theme park operations, food and beverage services, and entertainment offerings, this cost increase likely contributed to downward pressure on segment profitability unless offset by revenue growth or operational efficiencies. The 2024 segment results would reflect this labor cost burden, influencing overall margin performance.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA expensed repairs and maintenance costs as incurred, which formed a key component of the Theme Parks segment's operating expenses. By 2024, Theme Parks segment costs and expenses increased, driven in part by higher park operations costs, including repairs and maintenance, as well as significant preopening costs for Epic Universe. This reflects a shift from routine maintenance spending in 2022 to a more capital-intensive and operationally costly phase in 2024, as the company prepared for the new park's opening in May 2025.",

We record depreciation using the straight-line method over the asset's estimated useful life.

Capital expenditures for the construction of Universal Beijing Resort are presented separately in our consolidated statement of cash flows.\n\nCable Communications capitalizes the costs associated with the construction of and improvements to our cable transmission and distribution  facilities,  including  scalable  infrastructure  and  line  extensions;  costs  associated  with  acquiring  and  deploying  new customer premise equipment; and costs associated with installation of  our  services,  including  the  customer's  connection  to  our network,  in  accordance  with  the  accounting  guidance  related  to  cable  television  companies.  Costs  capitalized  include  all  direct costs  for  labor  and  materials,  as  well  as  various  indirect  costs.  Costs  incurred  in  connection  with  subsequent  disconnects,  and reconnects of previously deployed customer premise equipment, are expensed as they are incurred.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that  the  carrying  amount  may  not  be  recoverable. The  evaluation  is  based  on  the  cash  flows  generated  by  the  underlying  asset groups, including estimated future operating results, trends or other determinants of fair value. If the total of the expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset group, we would recognize an impairment charge to the extent the carrying amount of the asset group exceeded its estimated fair value. Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of depreciation expense.\n\nCertain  of  our  cable  franchise  agreements  and  lease  agreements  contain  provisions  requiring  us  to  restore  facilities  or  remove property in the event that the franchise or lease agreement is not renewed. We expect to continually renew our cable franchise agreements and therefore cannot reasonably estimate liabilities associated with such agreements. A remote possibility exists that franchise agreements could be terminated unexpectedly, which could result in us incurring significant expense in complying with restoration or removal provisions.

      "answer": "Disney's 2023 10-K filing disclosed operating cash flows for operating leases at $714M, which increased to $876M in 2024. This $162M increase directly contributed to the overall growth in total cash flows, which rose from $770M in 2023 to $933M in 2024.

      "answer": "In 2022, T's Consumer Wireline business contributed $12,749 million in operating revenues and $634 million in operating income within the Communications Segment. By 2023, these figures increased to $13,173 million in revenues (a 3.3% increase) and $651 million in income (a 2.7% increase). This modest growth indicates that while the Consumer Wireline unit maintained stability within the broader Communications Segment, its growth trajectory lagged behind Mobility and trailed off from stronger gains seen in prior years. The segment's overall dominance (accounting for ~97% of total segment revenues in both years) suggests that T continued to lean heavily on its core communications offerings, with Consumer Wireline playing a steady but not rapidly expanding role.",

      "answer": "AT&T's change in accounting treatment for prior service credits, which became effective in Q1 2023, directly impacted the year-over-year comparability of the Mobility segment's operating contribution. In 2022, Mobility had an operating contribution of $22,321 million as disclosed in the 2022 10-K filing. The 2023 filing revealed that AT&T stopped allocating prior service credits to business units, which increased Communications segment expenses (including Mobility) by approximately $2,400 million in 2022 when restated under the new methodology. This accounting change means that while Mobility's operating contribution appeared relatively stable year-over-year in raw figures (increasing only slightly from $22,321M in 2022 to $23,312M in 2023 according to historical reporting patterns), the actual underlying performance may have been different when accounting for this $2.4B expense reallocation that previously benefited the segment under the old reporting structure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney reported $13,432 million in licensed programming rights and advances, which directly influenced the amortization costs in 2023. According to the 2023 filings, amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across the Entertainment segment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. In 2023, the Entertainment segment generated $40,635 million in total revenue, distributed across its three major lines of business: Linear Networks ($7,369 million in affiliate fees and $7,594 million in advertising), Direct-to-Consumer ($16,420 million in subscription fees and $2,645 million in TV/VOD distribution licensing), and Content Sales/Licensing ($3,174 million in theatrical distribution licensing, $931 million in home entertainment, and $2,645 million in TV/VOD distribution licensing). The allocation of amortization costs from 2022 would have factored into how these revenue streams were managed and distributed across the segment's operations in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Communications Segment's Business Wireline operating income was $1,289 million, which dropped to a loss of $88 million in 2024 \u2014 a dramatic 110.8% decrease. This sharp decline directly impacted the total Communications Segment operating income, which fell from $27,801 million in 2023 to $27,095 million in 2024, despite a 1.8% increase in Mobility's operating income. The significant drop in Business Wireline income suggests that T may have strategically reallocated resources toward Mobility, which remained stable and slightly grew, from $25,861 million to $26,314 million. This shift indicates a refocusing on Mobility as a core growth driver, while Business Wireline appears to have been deprioritized or faced structural challenges.",

      "question": "How did the 8% increase in META's total costs and expenses from 2023 to 2024 impact the company's ability to maintain cost efficiency in relation to its revenue growth?",
      "answer": "In 2023, META's total costs and expenses were $88.151 billion, which increased to $95.121 billion in 2024, representing an 8% rise. During the same period, META's total revenue grew from $134.902 billion to $164.501 billion, a 22% increase. While the company experienced significant revenue growth, the 8% increase in costs and expenses outpaced the 7% growth in costs specifically within the Family of Apps segment. This suggests that while META scaled its revenue efficiently, the faster growth in overall costs may have placed pressure on cost efficiency, particularly in the broader company operations beyond the Family of Apps. The operating margin improved from 35% in 2023 to 42% in 2024, indicating that despite rising costs, META was still able to enhance its overall profitability.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Google Cloud was highlighted as a key growth segment contributing to non-advertising revenue, with expectations of continued investment in R&D and infrastructure. By 2024, Google Cloud's operating income had increased by $4.4 billion, partly due to revenue growth, but this was offset by rising employee compensation expenses driven by headcount expansion. Meanwhile, Google Services benefited from a reduction in employee compensation costs, which contributed to its significant operating income growth of $25.4 billion. This indicates a strategic shift where Google prioritized investment in Google Cloud talent while managing compensation costs in the broader Google Services division.",

While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

      "question": "How did the change in Mobility's operating income from 2023 ($25,861M) to 2024 ($23,812M) impact the Communications segment's overall profitability, and what does this suggest about the performance of T's wireless services during this period?",
      "answer": "Mobility's operating income decreased from $25,861M in 2023 to $23,812M in 2024, representing a decline of $2,049M or approximately 7.9%. This drop contributed to a reduction in the Communications segment's total operating income from $27,801M in 2023 to $26,736M in 2024, a decrease of $1,065M or 3.8%. Given that Mobility accounted for the majority of the Communications segment's profitability (over 92% in 2023 and 89% in 2024), this decline indicates weakening performance in T's wireless services, particularly within the Mobility unit.",

        "Hop 2: Communications Segment \u2192 Mobility: Mobility is a core component of the Communications segment, providing nationwide wireless service and equipment, and historically contributing the majority of the segment\u2019s operating income.",

EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting, and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and EBITDA margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney reported $15M in operating cash flows from finance leases, which dropped to $13M in 2023, contributing to a broader downward trend in total cash flows that fell from $799M to $770M. While operating lease cash flows declined more significantly\u2014from $736M to $714M\u2014financing cash flows for finance leases also decreased from $48M to $41M, suggesting a contraction in overall leasing activity. This pattern indicates that the drop in operating cash flows from finance leases was part of a wider reduction in cash inflows, rather than an isolated event, and likely reflects strategic or operational changes in how Disney structured its leasing activities across the two years.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Content Acquisition Costs were explicitly identified as a key expense negatively impacting Google Services operating income alongside TAC and compensation expenses, signaling cost pressures on the segment. By 2024, Google Services revenue had grown from $272.5B to $304.9B, suggesting either a mitigation of those cost pressures or an outperformance in revenue that offset rising expenses. The trajectory implies that despite the earlier cost challenges, Google Services managed to deliver significant revenue growth by 2024, potentially reflecting improved cost efficiency, better content licensing economics, or stronger monetization of YouTube and other content-driven platforms.",

Revenues  related  to  cloud  services  provided  on  a  consumption  basis  are  recognized  when  the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\n\n## Google Other Revenues\n\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n\n- Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;\n- hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;\n- YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n- other products and services.\n\nAs it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net  basis  because  our  performance  obligation  is  to  facilitate  a  transaction  between  app  developers  and  end  users,  for which we earn a service fee.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  may  include  multiple  performance  obligations.  For  such  arrangements,  we  allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred and when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).",

      "answer": "In 2022, NBCUniversal's Studios segment underwent a restructuring, as evidenced by the segment change in the balance table, where $3,672 million was attributed to Studios (chunk_1). This restructuring aligned Studios more closely with the Media and Sky segments, changing the timing of revenue recognition for content licensing from over time (aligned with amortization) to at a point in time when content is delivered and made available for use (chunk_2). By 2024, this change was fully reflected in the Studios segment reporting, where content licensing revenue was recognized upon delivery of content, with a portion of future revenue tied to multiyear agreements that span approximately one-half year to 1 year of annual revenue (chunk_3). This shift in recognition timing reflects a more immediate revenue realization model post-restructuring.",

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\n\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\nWe recognize revenue as the services are provided over the contract period. Substantially all of our customers are initially under contracts, with terms typically ranging  from 2  years  for  small  and  medium-sized  businesses  to  up  to 5  years  for  larger  enterprises.  Customers  with  contracts  may  only  discontinue  service  in accordance with the terms of their contracts. At any given time, the amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing agreements is equal to approximately half of our annual Business Services Connectivity segment revenue, of which the substantial majority will be recognized within 2 years. Customers under contract typically pay on a monthly basis. Installation revenue and sales commissions are generally deferred and recognized over the respective contract terms.\n\n## Media Segment\n\n## Advertising\n\nMedia generates revenue from the sale of advertising on our linear television networks, Peacock and other digital properties.\n\nWe have determined that a contract exists for our advertising sales once all terms and conditions are agreed upon, typically when the number of advertising units is specifically identified and scheduled. Advertisements are generally aired or delivered within one year once all terms and conditions are agreed upon. Revenue is recognized, net of agency commissions, in the period in which advertisements are aired or delivered and payment occurs thereafter, with payment generally required within 30 days.  In some instances, we guarantee audience ratings for the advertisements. To the extent there is a shortfall in contracts where the ratings were guaranteed, a portion of the revenue is deferred until the shortfall is settled, typically by providing additional advertising units generally within one year of the original airing.\n\n## Distribution\n\nMedia generates revenue from the distribution of television programming in the United States and internationally to traditional multichannel video providers, such as our Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segment, and to virtual multichannel video providers that offer streamed linear television networks. This revenue includes amounts under NBC and Telemundo retransmission consent agreements, and we also receive associated fees from NBC-affiliated and Telemundo-affiliated local broadcast television stations. We also receive monthly subscription fees for our Peacock service either directly from customers or from companies who sell Peacock to customers on our behalf. We have determined that we are principal in these arrangements and in the event we do not have transparency into the pricing charged by a company selling Peacock on our behalf, the amount of revenue recognized is limited to the fees receivable from that company pursuant to our arrangement.\n\nMonthly fees received under distribution agreements with multichannel video providers are generally under multiyear agreements with revenue based on the number of subscribers receiving the programming on our television networks and a per subscriber fee, although revenue for certain of our television networks is based on a fix ed fee. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally include payment within 60 days. These arrangements are accounted for as licenses of functional intellectual property and revenue is recognized as programming is provided.\n\n## Studios Segment\n\n## Content Licensing\n\nStudios generates revenue from the worldwide licensing of our owned film and television content to television networks and DTC streaming service providers, as well as through video on demand services provided by multichannel video providers and other service providers. Our agreements generally include fixed pricing and span multiple years. For example, following a film's theatrical release, Studios may license the exhibition rights of a film to different customers over multiple successive distribution windows.\n\nWe recognize revenue when the content is delivered and available for use by the licensee. When the term of an existing agreement is renewed or extended, we recognize revenue when the licensed content becomes available under the renewal or extension. Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although payments are generally collected over the license term. The amount of future revenue to be earned related to fixed pricing under existing third-party agreements at any given time equals approximately one-half year to 1 year of annual Studios content licensing revenue, which is the segment with the largest portion of this future revenue. The majority of this revenue will be recognized within 2 years. This amount may fluctuate from period to period depending on the timing of the releases and the availability of content under existing agreements and may not represent the total revenue expected to be recognized as it does not include revenue from future agreements or from variable pricing or optional purchases under existing agreements.\n\nFor our agreements that include variable pricing, such as pricing based on the number of subscribers to a DTC streaming service sold by our customers, we generally recognize revenue as our customers sell to their subscribers.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did the 10% increase in Reality Labs' operating loss from 2023 to 2024, driven by rising employee compensation and infrastructure costs, impact Meta's overall financial performance and strategic investment priorities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Reality Labs accounted for 20% of Meta's total costs and expenses, with $18.02 billion invested in metaverse-related initiatives such as VR/AR devices and foundational technologies. By 2024, Reality Labs' loss from operations increased by $1.61 billion (10%), primarily due to higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs. This growing financial burden contrasted with the Family of Apps' 39% increase in income from operations, which was partially offset by rising costs across both segments. The increasing losses in Reality Labs underscored Meta's continued strategic commitment to the metaverse despite short-term financial pressures, with the company relying on profits from its core advertising business to fund these long-term investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Corporate and Other segment reported only $5 million in cash paid for intangible assets, indicating minimal investment activity at that level of the company. However, the consolidated financials for 2022 show that CMCSA paid $3,141 million overall for intangible assets, suggesting that the majority of these investments were concentrated within other business segments like Media, Studios, or Theme Parks. In 2023, the company increased its overall investment in intangible assets to $3,298 million, a continuation and slight rise from the prior year. This pattern implies that the strategic focus on acquiring intangible assets remained primarily within specific operating segments rather than being driven by the Corporate and Other segment. The contrast between the segment-level $5 million and the consolidated figures highlights a targeted allocation of capital toward intangible assets within operational units rather than at the corporate level.",

      "question": "How did Disney's treatment of licensed programming rights costs evolve from fiscal 2022 to 2024, and what were the financial implications of the $257 million impairment charge related to these rights recorded in fiscal 2023?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney disclosed that programming and production costs included amortization of licensed programming rights, which were a core component of the Entertainment segment\u2019s expenses. These costs were managed through amortization based on the estimated relative value of distribution windows. In fiscal 2023, Disney recorded a $257 million impairment charge specifically for licensed programming rights, as noted in Note 18 of the 2024 filing, which was excluded from the standard amortization and instead reflected in 'Restructuring and impairment charges'. By fiscal 2024, Disney continued to include licensed programming rights within programming and production costs, but the prior-year impairment suggests a reassessment of the recoverability of these assets. This indicates a shift in strategy or valuation assumptions around content investments, particularly as the $257 million charge in 2023 signaled a material write-down of previously capitalized rights.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS(2022) \u2192 Programming and Production Costs: Disclosed that these costs included amortization of licensed programming rights, particularly under the Studios, General Entertainment, Sports, and International content creation groups.",
        "Hop 2: Programming and Production Costs \u2192 Licensed Programming Rights: The 2024 filing explicitly states that these costs include amortization of licensed programming rights and that impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 2023 and 2024.",
        "Hop 3: Licensed Programming Rights \u2190 DIS(2024): The 2024 filing references a $257 million impairment charge in fiscal 2023 for licensed programming rights, indicating a material change in how these rights were valued or utilized compared to 2022."

      "answer": "T's Mobility segment experienced a decline in operating income from $25,861 million in 2023 to $23,812 million in 2024, while Operations and Support Expenses rose from $49,604 million in 2023 to $49,770 million in 2024. This indicates that despite maintaining relatively flat expenses, the drop in operating income suggests a deterioration in the segment's profitability.

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Sky segment was a key consumer of content licensed from Studios, as noted in the intersegment revenue disclosures, with licensing revenue recognized at a point in time when content was delivered. By 2024, the Studios segment was directly licensing content to Media, indicating a strategic shift toward internal content monetization within the broader Media segment rather than through Sky. This evolution is further contextualized by Sky\u2019s significant segment balance of $29.196 billion in 2021, which suggests it was a major internal customer for Studios' content prior to the shift. The change in licensing structure implies a reorganization of how CMCSA distributes and monetizes internal content, moving away from Sky as a central licensee toward a more direct Studios-to-Media model.",

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\n\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\n\n",

By 2024, the company cited the Consumer Segment as the primary driver of consolidated operating revenue growth, indicating a shift in focus or performance within this segment. This evolution suggests that the Consumer Segment became a stronger contributor to revenue growth compared to other segments, particularly in contrast to the modest 1.4% overall revenue increase in 2023.

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Disney's Linear Networks were central to content distribution, with General Entertainment planning to produce over 270 original programs, most of which were intended for both Linear Networks and DTC platforms. This dual-use model supported Affiliate Fees, which Linear Networks generated by charging MVPDs for access to programming. By 2024, the company had restructured its focus under the Entertainment segment, emphasizing direct-to-consumer platforms like Disney+ and Hulu, while still maintaining a strong Linear Networks presence (including ABC, Disney, Freeform, and FX). Despite this shift, Affiliate Fees remained a core revenue stream, explicitly called out in 2024 as fees charged to MVPDs and ABC-affiliated stations. The evolution in content strategy\u2014balancing linear and streaming distribution\u2014suggests a deliberate effort to sustain Affiliate Fee revenue while adapting to changing viewer consumption habits.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

      "question": "How did the impact of pandemic-related disruptions on CMCSA's Adjusted EBITDA in 2022 flow through to the Corporate and Other segment's cost structure and strategic investments by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Adjusted EBITDA was significantly negatively impacted by pandemic-related disruptions, particularly in the Theme Parks segment, which reported an Adjusted EBITDA of $2,498 million, and in the Studios segment, which reported $1,058 million, both below pre-pandemic levels due to theatrical delays and content licensing disruptions. This financial pressure was disclosed in the Corporate and Other segment, which reported an Adjusted EBITDA loss of $820 million in 2022. By 2024, the Corporate and Other segment included strategic investments and operational overhead for entities like Xumo and Comcast Spectacor, indicating a shift toward digital platforms and sports assets to mitigate future disruptions and diversify revenue streams. This evolution reflects a strategic realignment driven by the financial pressures observed in 2022.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA disclosed that NBCUniversal and Sky had multiyear agreements for broadcast rights of sporting events, which represented the substantial majority of the company's programming and production obligations. Approximately 40% of these cash payments were due after five years, primarily related to long-term sports rights agreements. By 2024, NBCUniversal's guaranteed debt remained stable at $1.6 billion, indicating that despite ongoing commitments to programming rights, the company maintained a consistent level of guaranteed financial exposure through NBCUniversal. This suggests that while programming obligations continued to be a major operational expense, the financial guarantee structure through NBCUniversal did not change significantly, potentially reflecting disciplined capital structure management.",

As of December 31, 2021, our debt has a weighted-average time to maturity of approximately 18 years and a weighted-average interest rate based on the stated coupons and including the effects of our derivative financial  instruments  of  3.44%. We typically fund and expect to continue to be able to fund debt maturities and interest payments with cash flows generated in our operations; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; or proceeds from additional external financing. See Note 6 for additional information on our debt.\n\nWe also have significant contractual obligations associated with our programming and production expenses. NBCUniversal and Sky  have  multiyear  agreements  for  broadcast  rights  of  sporting  events,  such  as  the  Olympics,  the  NFL  and  European  football leagues,  which  represent  the  substantial  majority  of  our  programming  and  production  obligations.  Cable  Communications' programming  expenses  related  to  the  distribution  of  third-party  programmed  channels  are  generally  acquired  under  multiyear distribution  agreements,  with  fees  typically  based  on  the  number  of  customers  that  receive  the  programming  and  the  extent  of distribution. As  a  result,  the  amounts  included  in  the  table  above  under  fixed  or  minimum  guaranteed  commitments  for  these distribution agreements are not material and we expect the total fees to be paid under these arrangements to be significantly higher than  the  amounts  included  above. We  have  funded  and  expect  to  continue  to  be  able  to  fund  our  programming  and  production obligations with the cash generated from our operations. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 40% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, primarily related to multiyear sports rights agreements. See Note 4 for additional information on programming and production costs.\n\nOur other contractual obligations relate primarily to operating leases (see Note 15) and other arrangements recorded in our balance sheet  and/or  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  our  financial  statements,  including  benefit  plan  obligations  (see  Note  11),  liabilities  for uncertain  tax  positions  (see  Note  5),  our  remaining  unfunded  capital  commitment  to  Atairos  (see  Note  8)  and  a  contractual obligation related to an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks (see Note 15).\n\n## Guarantee Structure\n\nOur debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.",

We typically fund and expect to continue to be able to fund debt maturities and interest payments with cash flows generated in our operations; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; or proceeds from additional external financing. See Note 6 for additional information on our debt.\n\nWe also have significant contractual obligations associated with our programming and production expenses. NBCUniversal and Sky  have  multiyear  agreements  for  broadcast  rights  of  sporting  events,  such  as  the  Olympics,  the  NFL  and  European  football leagues,  which  represent  the  substantial  majority  of  our  programming  and  production  obligations.  Cable  Communications' programming  expenses  related  to  the  distribution  of  third-party  programmed  channels  are  generally  acquired  under  multiyear distribution  agreements,  with  fees  typically  based  on  the  number  of  customers  that  receive  the  programming  and  the  extent  of distribution. As  a  result,  the  amounts  included  in  the  table  above  under  fixed  or  minimum  guaranteed  commitments  for  these distribution agreements are not material and we expect the total fees to be paid under these arrangements to be significantly higher than  the  amounts  included  above. We  have  funded  and  expect  to  continue  to  be  able  to  fund  our  programming  and  production obligations with the cash generated from our operations. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 40% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, primarily related to multiyear sports rights agreements. See Note 4 for additional information on programming and production costs.\n\nOur other contractual obligations relate primarily to operating leases (see Note 15) and other arrangements recorded in our balance sheet  and/or  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  our  financial  statements,  including  benefit  plan  obligations  (see  Note  11),  liabilities  for uncertain  tax  positions  (see  Note  5),  our  remaining  unfunded  capital  commitment  to  Atairos  (see  Note  8)  and  a  contractual obligation related to an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks (see Note 15).\n\n## Guarantee Structure\n\nOur debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.",

      "question": "How did Disney's approach to allocating distribution costs between its Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer platforms evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what strategic implications does this have for their content distribution model?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney explicitly listed 'distribution costs' as a distinct operating expense category under Linear Networks, indicating a more siloed cost structure where each platform bore its own distribution expenses. By 2024, the reporting structure showed a more integrated approach, with distribution costs now subsumed under broader operating expenses at the Entertainment segment level, suggesting a shift toward centralized cost management. This change aligns with Disney's 2022 statement about an 'intentionally flexible approach to distribution' that impacts cost allocation, revenue timing, and content mix. The evolution implies a strategic move toward optimizing costs across platforms rather than maintaining rigid platform-specific expense silos, likely to support their growing Direct-to-Consumer initiatives while maintaining their traditional Linear Networks business.",

        "Hop 2: Distribution Costs \u2192 Linear Networks: In 2022, Linear Networks' operating expenses included a clear line item for distribution costs, indicating direct attribution of these expenses to the segment.",
        "Hop 3: Linear Networks \u2190 DIS(2024): By 2024, Linear Networks' cost structure was reported under the broader Entertainment segment, with distribution costs now integrated into general operating expenses rather than listed separately."

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "In 2023, T reported increased wholesale revenues as part of its service revenues, which included growth in subscribers and higher wholesale revenues. However, in 2024, the company disclosed a $30 million decrease in wholesale revenues, including fuel, primarily due to the expiration of a wholesale customer contract at Duke Energy Indiana. Despite this decline, T's Latin America segment operating revenues increased by 7.6% from 2023 to 2024, indicating that the regional growth helped offset the negative impact from the reduction in wholesale revenues. This suggests that while T faced headwinds in its wholesale segment in 2024, its Latin America operations provided a counterbalance through strong year-over-year performance.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA disclosed that distribution costs related to theatrical releases and licensing were not capitalized and were treated as period expenses, with amortization of owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis using the individual film forecast computation method. By 2024, the Entertainment segment's operating expenses explicitly included distribution costs as a core component alongside programming and production costs, with amortization allocated across businesses based on estimated relative value of distribution windows. This indicates a more integrated cost allocation strategy emerged by 2024, where distribution costs became part of the broader expense framework directly shaping segment performance. The shift reflects a strategic realignment in how CMCSA managed content lifecycle costs within the Entertainment segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs  are  based  on  anticipated  release  patterns  and  distribution  strategies,  public  acceptance  and  historical  results  for  similar productions.  Amortization  for  content  predominantly  monetized  with  other  owned  or  licensed  content  is  recorded  based  on estimated  usage.  In  determining  the  method  of  amortization  and  estimated  life  of  an  acquired  film  or  television  library,  we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do  not  capitalize  costs  related  to  the  distribution  of  a  film  in  movie  theaters  or  the  licensing  or  sale  of  a  film  or  television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe may enter  into  cofinancing  arrangements  with  third  parties  to  jointly  finance  or  distribute  certain  of  our  film  productions. Cofinancing  arrangements  can  take  various  forms,  but  in  most  cases  involve  the  grant  of  an  economic  interest  in  a  film  to  an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor's  interest  in  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  film  is  recorded  as  either  a  charge  or  a  benefit,  respectively,  in  programming  and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and  record  an  impairment  charge  to  the  extent  the  unamortized  costs  exceed  the  fair  value.  Owned  content  is  assessed  either individually  or  in  identified  film  groups,  for  content  predominantly  monetized  on  an  individual  basis  or  with  other  content, respectively.  The  substantial  majority  of  our  owned  content  is  evaluated  for  impairment  on  an  individual  title  basis.  Licensed content that  is  not  part  of  a  film  group  is  generally  assessed  in  packages,  channels  or  dayparts. A  daypart  is  an  aggregation  of programs  broadcast  during  a  particular  time  of  day  or  programs  of  a  similar  type.  Licensed  content  is  tested  for  impairment primarily  on  a  channel,  network  or  platform  basis,  with  the  exception  of  our  broadcast  networks  and  owned  local  broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative  value.  Estimated  relative  value  is  generally  based  on  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  nature  of  and  potential  revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment.  When  cash  payments,  including  advanced  payments,  exceed  the  relative  value  of  the  sports  rights  delivered,  we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content.\n\n## Note 5: Income Taxes\n\n## Income Before Income Taxes\n\n",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "question": "How did Disney's shift in content allocation between Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer segments from 2022 to 2024 impact the scale and monetization strategy of their streaming platform?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney's Linear Networks relied heavily on General Entertainment and Sports content, with over 270 original programs planned for both Linear Networks and DTC platforms, including 130 series produced specifically for DTC. By 2024, the Direct-to-Consumer segment had evolved into a core pillar of the Entertainment segment, generating revenue primarily through subscription fees and advertising, with intersegment licensing arrangements reflecting deeper integration between content creators and distribution platforms. The shift was marked by increased reliance on internal content pipelines\u2014such as fees paid to Sports for ESPN on ABC and Disney+\u2014indicating a strategic pivot toward platform-driven monetization and away from traditional affiliate and advertising models. This evolution suggests that the company reallocated high-value content from linear to streaming, aiming to grow subscriber bases and diversify revenue streams.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS(2022) \u2192 Linear Networks: Disney's Linear Networks in 2022 were supported by over 270 original programs, with 130 series produced specifically for DTC platforms, indicating a transitional content strategy.",
        "Hop 2: Linear Networks \u2192 Direct-to-Consumer: The Direct-to-Consumer business in 2022 depended on Linear Networks for rights to air linear feeds and incurred fees, showing a structural interdependence between the two segments.",
        "Hop 3: Direct-to-Consumer \u2190 DIS(2024): By 2024, Direct-to-Consumer was a central revenue driver under the unified Entertainment segment, with explicit intersegment fees paid to Sports for programming, reflecting a more integrated and platform-centric model."

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

The Company's 50% interest in this gain was $56 million (A+E gain) and is included in Restructuring and impairment charges in this table. (4)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenue and segment operating income.\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "In 2023, T's Total Operating Revenues grew by 1.4% to $122.428 billion, providing a relatively stable financial base. In 2024, despite an overall decrease in Operating Revenues, the Consumer Wireline segment saw gains driven by wireless and broadband services, which stood in contrast to declines in Business Wireline. The Consumer Wireline segment was also subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements in 2024, which used discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches to estimate its value. This suggests that while the broader revenue environment weakened, the Consumer Wireline segment remained a growth area that required careful valuation modeling, potentially reflecting optimism about its future performance despite the broader revenue challenges.",

      "question": "How did the decline in T's Mobility segment operating income from $25,861 million in 2023 to $23,812 million in 2024 relate to changes in the company's overall operating performance and strategic positioning within the Mobility segment?",
      "answer": "T's Mobility segment operating income decreased from $25,861 million in 2023 to $23,812 million in 2024, reflecting a $2,049 million drop. This decline occurred alongside a broader trend of reduced operating income for the company, which fell from $23,461 million in 2023 to a loss of $4,587 million in 2024. The Mobility segment remained the largest contributor to T's overall performance, but its shrinking operating income suggests either increased costs, lower revenues, or strategic investments that reduced short-term profitability. The data indicates that while Mobility still generated the highest operating income among segments in 2024, the company's overall financial health deteriorated significantly, potentially due to strategic decisions or external pressures affecting the Mobility segment's profitability.",

        "Hop 1: T(2023) \u2192 Operating Income (Loss): T reported an operating income of $23,461 million in 2023, with the Mobility segment contributing $25,861 million.",
        "Hop 2: Operating Income (Loss) \u2192 Mobility: The Mobility segment was a key profit driver in 2023, but by 2024, its operating income had declined to $23,812 million.",
        "Hop 3: Mobility \u2190 T(2024): In 2024, despite a drop in Mobility's operating income, it remained the strongest segment, while the company as a whole reported an operating loss of $4,587 million."

This decline placed downward pressure on overall revenue streams. According to the 2023 filing, advertising revenue directly impacts the average monthly total revenue per customer relationship, as changes in advertising revenue influence the overall revenue base tied to customer relationships. In response, CMCSA's 2024 filing highlights a strategic focus on rate adjustments, service bundling, and prioritizing higher-margin services to maintain or grow average monthly revenue per customer relationship despite ongoing advertising headwinds.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon reorganized its Business segment by consolidating customer groups, maintaining Wholesale as a distinct unit while merging others like Global Enterprise and Public Sector. This reorganization was part of a broader effort to streamline operations and align customer groups more cohesively. By 2024, the Business segment continued to operate with Wholesale as one of its three core customer groups, indicating that the Wholesale function remained a strategic priority. The segment's performance and resource allocation were evaluated by the CODM using segment operating income, suggesting that the Wholesale group's performance in 2024 was directly influenced by the structural changes made in 2023, with strategic decisions on network technologies, capital expenditures, and geographic expansion being shaped by this reorganization.",

When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

By 2024, while the segment remained a core contributor, internal financial dynamics\u2014specifically the deferral of intersegment profits on content licensing from Studios to Media\u2014impacted the timing of Adjusted EBITDA realization. These deferrals, as noted in the 2024 filing, caused a mismatch between segment-level Adjusted EBITDA and consolidated results, suggesting that Cable Communications' relative contribution to consolidated Adjusted EBITDA may have appeared lower in 2024 despite stable core operations, due to shifts in expense allocation and intersegment revenue timing.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney recognized a prior service cost of $467 million in postretirement medical plans, indicating a liability increase that required future funding. By 2024, Disney responded by investing $95 million in total contributions toward both pension and postretirement medical plans. This suggests that the company adjusted its investment strategy to address the financial obligations stemming from prior service costs, particularly in the postretirement medical segment. The $95 million contribution reflects a direct financial response to the previously recognized liability, showing a temporal evolution from liability recognition to strategic funding action.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products reported $2,680 million in domestic revenue, as disclosed in the 2022 10-K filing. By 2024, domestic revenue had increased to $3,763 million, reflecting a 40% growth over two years. This significant rise indicates a strong recovery in Disney's core entertainment segment, particularly in its domestic operations, which may signal improved market positioning, higher consumer demand, or successful post-pandemic operational adjustments. The growth also suggests that strategic initiatives, such as increased investment in experiential offerings and park expansions, likely contributed to this upward trend.",

      "answer": "In 2022, T disclosed that Corporate and Other included acquisition-related items such as amortization of intangible assets, and specifically noted that prior service credit amortization and retained costs from the Video business were reclassified or retained for comparability purposes. In early 2023, T implemented a policy change where prior service credits were no longer recorded in individual business units or charged to Corporate and Other, but instead were recorded as other income in the consolidated income statement. This reclassification increased Communications segment operating expenses by approximately $2,400 in 2022 and $2,100 in 2021, while correspondingly lowering administrative expenses within Corporate and Other. The evolution shows a strategic shift in how T internally allocates and reports pension-related costs, moving away from segment-level amortization to a consolidated treatment, which affects how acquisition-related items are contextualized within Corporate and Other.",

The services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies. Our reportable segments are organized as follows:\n\nThe Communications segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n\n- Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n- Business Wireline provides advanced IP-based services, as well as traditional voice and data services to business customers.\n- Consumer Wireline provides internet, including broadband fiber, and legacy telephony voice communication services to residential customers.\n\nThe WarnerMedia segment develops, produces and distributes feature films, television, gaming and other content in various physical and digital formats globally. WarnerMedia content is distributed through basic networks, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) or theatrical, TV content and games licensing. Segment results also include Xandr advertising and Otter Media Holdings (Otter Media). We disposed of substantially all Otter Media assets in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft). (See Note 6)\n\nThe Latin America segment provides wireless services and equipment in Mexico, and prior to the November 2021 disposition of Vrio, video services in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nCorporate and Other reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes, and includes:\n\n- Corporate , which consists of: (1) businesses no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, (2) corporate support functions, (3) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, and (4) the reclassification of the amortization of prior service credits, which we continue to report with segment operating expenses, to consolidated 'Other income (expense) - net.' Costs previously allocated to the Video business that were retained after the transaction, net of reimbursements from DIRECTV under transition service agreements, are reported in Corporate following the transaction through 2022, to maintain comparability of our operating segment results, and while operational plans and continued cost reduction initiatives are implemented.\n- Video , which consists of our former U.S. video operations that were contributed to DIRECTV on July 31, 2021 and also includes our share of DIRECTV's earnings as equity in net income of affiliates (see Note 10).\n- Acquisition-related items , which consists of items associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets.\n- Certain significant items , which includes (1) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (2) asset impairments and abandonments, and (3) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated.\n- Eliminations and consolidations , which (1) removes transactions involving dealings between our segments, including channel distribution between WarnerMedia and Video prior to its separation, and (2) includes adjustments for our reporting of the advertising business.",

      "answer": "The 14% decline in Disney's TV/VOD distribution revenue from $2,618 million in 2023 to $2,255 million in 2024 likely constrained the Content Sales/Licensing segment's revenue generation opportunities from film and episodic content in these markets. As the Content Sales/Licensing segment specifically operates by generating revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in TV/VOD markets, a reduction in TV/VOD distribution revenue suggests fewer monetization opportunities through this channel. This decline indicates either reduced volume of content distributed or lower pricing realization, directly affecting the segment's core revenue streams.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

This segment also contributed all of the company's segment operating income, which stood at $27,801 million in 2023. By 2024, the Communications Segment's operating income slightly declined to $27,095 million from $27,801 million in 2023, despite maintaining a dominant share of the company's overall performance. However, the operating income margin for the Communications Segment remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from 23.6% in 2023 to 23.0% in 2024, indicating that the overall efficiency of the segment was largely maintained despite the minimal revenue growth.",

      "answer": "The significant decrease in T's vendor financing payables from $6,147 million in 2022 to $2,833 million in 2023 indicates a strategic shift toward reducing reliance on short-term vendor financing as a source of liquidity. This is further supported by the corresponding drop in the portion included in 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities' from $4,592 million in 2022 to $1,975 million in 2023, suggesting the company may have accelerated payments or renegotiated supplier terms. Given that vendor financing payables are a form of short-term obligation often used to manage cash flow, this reduction implies a more conservative approach to liquidity management in 2023 compared to 2022.",

The guarantee obligation at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $371 and $228, respectively, of which $101 and $161 are included in 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities' on our consolidated balance sheets, with the remainder in 'Other noncurrent liabilities.' Our maximum exposure to loss as a result of selling these equipment installment receivables is limited to the total amount of our deferred purchase price and guarantee obligation.\n\n## Revolving Receivables Program\n\nWe have a revolving agreement to transfer up to $6,680 of certain receivables (primarily from WarnerMedia) through our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries to various financial institutions on a recurring basis in exchange for cash equal to the gross receivables transferred. This agreement is subject to renewal on an annual basis and the transfer limit may be expanded or reduced from time to time. As customers pay their balances, we transfer additional receivables into the program, resulting in our gross receivables sold exceeding net cash flow impacts (e.g., collect and reinvest). The transferred receivables are fully guaranteed by our bankruptcy-remote subsidiaries, which hold additional receivables in the amount of $3,527 that are pledged as collateral under this agreement. The transfers are recorded at fair value of the proceeds received and obligations assumed less derecognized receivables. The obligation is subsequently adjusted for changes in estimated expected credit losses and interest rates. Our maximum exposure to loss related to these receivables transferred is limited to the amount outstanding.\n\nThe fair value measurement used for the obligation is considered Level 3 under the Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure framework (see Note 13).\n\nThe following table sets forth a summary of receivables sold:\n\n",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Disney announced increased investment in its Experiences segment, including expansions of theme parks, cruise ships, and international operations. This led to higher distribution costs in the Experiences segment in 2024, as these investments directly increased infrastructure and operational expenses. However, this increase was partially offset by lower distribution costs in other areas\u2014such as theatrical, home entertainment, and TV/VOD distribution\u2014where costs declined due to fewer major releases and lower marketing spend (e.g., a $487 million decrease in selling, general, and administrative costs, including theatrical marketing). Thus, while the Experiences segment saw rising distribution costs due to strategic investment, the overall company-level distribution cost increase was moderated by cost reductions elsewhere.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Theme Parks segment generated only $2 million in revenue, indicating a very small but growing contribution following the pandemic-related closures and restrictions in 2020 and 2021. This low but improving revenue base, tied directly to guest spending on tickets and in-park purchases, signaled recovery potential. By 2023, CMCSA responded by disclosing major strategic investments, including the development of Universal's Epic Universe in Orlando (scheduled for 2025), a new theme park in Frisco, Texas, and a year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas. These plans reflect a forward-looking strategy to capitalize on the rebound in guest spending and tourism trends, aiming to expand the Theme Parks segment\u2019s role in the company's overall revenue mix.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Consumer Wireline segment was part of the Communications unit that achieved a 23.6% operating income margin, showing strong performance. However, in 2024, overall Communications operating revenues declined by 0.3% ($117,652M in 2024 vs. $118,038M in 2023). This decline occurred despite Consumer Wireline continuing to drive revenue gains because it was outweighed by significant drops in other areas\u2014particularly Business Wireline, which saw reduced demand for legacy services and the absence of cybersecurity revenues after the formation of LevelBlue, as well as lower Mobility equipment revenue. Thus, while Consumer Wireline positively impacted 2024 revenues, its effect was not sufficient to offset broader declines across the Communications segment.",

      "answer": "Despite the Communications Segment maintaining a stable valuation of approximately $91,900 million in 2022 and continuing to account for 97% of total segment operating revenues in 2023, Business Wireline faced specific financial scrutiny as indicated by its inclusion in nonrecurring fair value measurements.

While the 2022 filing notes that higher promotional costs negatively impacted operating income, the multi-year trend suggests these investments may have supported revenue growth in the following years, particularly in Google Search ($175B to $198B) and YouTube ads ($31.5B to $36.1B).

      "question": "How did the growth in META's Apps Segment revenue from $133.0B in 2023 to $162.4B in 2024 influence the year-over-year increase in income from operations, and what does this suggest about the scalability of the segment's profitability?",
      "answer": "The growth in META's Apps Segment revenue from $133.0B in 2023 to $162.4B in 2024 contributed to a significant increase in income from operations, which rose from $62.9B in 2023 to $87.1B in 2024. This represents a 39% year-over-year increase in income from operations, outpacing the 22% revenue growth. This suggests that the Apps Segment experienced improved scalability in profitability, as the increase in income was proportionally higher than the increase in revenue, indicating effective cost management or operational leverage.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Communications Segment reported a Business Wireline operating income of $1,289 million, which sharply declined to a loss of $88 million in 2024, reflecting a deterioration in performance and a negative shift in the segment's profitability. This change was part of a broader trend where Business Wireline revenues fell from $20,883 million in 2023 to $18,819 million in 2024, a drop of 9.9%. The 2024 nonrecurring fair value measurement, which included the Business Wireline reporting unit, signals that T assessed potential impairments using discounted cash flow and market multiple models, suggesting concerns about the long-term value and strategic viability of this business line.",

By 2023, operating cash flows from operating leases decreased to $714 million, while total cash flows also dropped to $770 million.

      "answer": "In 2022, T reported Operating Revenues of $2,607M, which had already been declining from prior years. By 2024, the Business Wireline segment, a key component of the company's revenue structure, saw its segment operating revenues drop to $18,819M in 2024 from $22,538M in 2022, a decline of over $3.7B. More significantly, Business Wireline moved from generating $2,290M in operating income in 2022 to a loss of ($88M) in 2024, indicating a dramatic deterioration in the segment's financial health. This decline in both top-line revenue and bottom-line performance within Business Wireline directly contributed to the broader downward trend in T's overall operating revenues and suggests a strategic or operational shift, as further evidenced by the 2024 disclosure of nonrecurring fair value measurements for the Business Wireline reporting unit, signaling potential impairments or restructuring.",

However, by 2024, the average monthly revenue per paying membership increased by 6% to $17.20, up from $16.28 in 2023, indicating a reversal in the trend.

      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA's Theme Parks Segment, which includes the Consumer Products Business, experienced revenue growth driven by international parks recovering from prior-year pandemic restrictions and the opening of Super Nintendo World at the Hollywood park. Operational costs increased due to higher guest attendance. In 2024, however, revenue from the Theme Parks Segment declined due to lower domestic attendance and foreign currency impacts, while operational costs rose further, notably due to preopening costs for Epic Universe. This indicates a shift where the Consumer Products Business became part of a more cost-intensive and investment-driven theme park strategy in 2024 compared to the recovery-driven growth in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2023) \u2192 Consumer Products Business: CMCSA's 2023 Theme Parks Segment revenue included contributions from the Consumer Products Business, with growth driven by international parks and new attractions like Super Nintendo World.",
        "Hop 2: Consumer Products Business \u2192 Theme Parks Segment: The Consumer Products Business was a revenue component of the Theme Parks Segment, which also included ticket sales and in-park spending, with costs rising due to increased attendance.",

      "question": "How did the allocation of subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service in 2024 reflect changes in Disney's programming and production cost structure compared to 2022, particularly in relation to the Sports segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney disclosed that programming and production costs included subscriber-based fees for programming its Hulu services, which encompassed fees paid to the Sports segment for the right to air ESPN and other sports content on Hulu Live. By 2024, the Entertainment segment specifically detailed that these subscriber-based fees included payments to the Sports segment for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live, indicating a more formalized or emphasized cost allocation. This evolution suggests that Disney\u2019s cost structure for Hulu Live became more explicitly tied to intersegment fees with Sports in 2024, reflecting a potential increase in sports content integration or a strategic shift in how costs were allocated internally.",

          "chunk_text": "## AT&amp;T Inc.\n\n## Dollars in millions ex cept per share amounts\n\nThe weighted average interest rate of our long-term debt portfolio, including credit agreement borrowings and the impact of derivatives, was approximately 4.2% as of December 31, 2024 and as of December 31, 2023. We had $122,116 of total notes and debentures outstanding at December 31, 2024. This also included Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Swiss franc and Australian dollar denominated debt that totaled approximately $30,685.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, we had $5,089 of long-term debt maturing within one year. We had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings or other short-term borrowings on December 31, 2024. The weighted average interest rate on our outstanding short-term borrowings was approximately 6.0% as of December 31, 2023.\n\nDuring 2024, we paid $1,792 of cash under our vendor financing program, compared to $5,742 in 2023. Total vendor financing payables included in our December 31, 2024 consolidated balance sheet were $1,448, with $749 due within one year (in 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities') and the remainder predominantly due within five years (in 'Other noncurrent liabilities').\n\nIn December 2024, our Board of Directors approved a $10,000 share repurchase authorization and terminated the March 2014 authorization, under which approximately 144 million shares were available for repurchase. At December 31, 2024, we had $10,000 remaining from our common stock repurchase authorization approved by the Board of Directors in December 2024.\n\nWe paid dividends on common and preferred shares of $8,208 in 2024, compared with $8,136 in 2023. Dividends on common stock declared by our Board of Directors totaled $1.11 per share in 2024 and in 2023. Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT&amp;T and long-term growth opportunities.\n\nOur 2025 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors, and repurchasing common stock when deemed appropriate. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt and asset sales. The timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends.\n\n## Credit Facilities\n\nThe following summary of our various credit and loan agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to each agreement filed as exhibits to our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a tool in managing our liquidity status. We currently have a $12,000 revolving credit agreement that terminates on November 18, 2029 (Revolving Credit Agreement). No amount was outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2024.\n\nWe also utilize other ex ternal financing sources, which include various credit arrangements supported by government agencies to support network equipment purchases as well as a commercial paper program.\n\nOur Revolving Credit Agreement contains covenants that are customary for an issuer with an investment grade senior debt credit rating as well as a net debt-toEBITDA financial ratio covenant requiring AT&amp;T to maintain, as of the last day of each fiscal quarter, a ratio of not more than 3.75-to-1. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with the covenants for our credit facilities.\n\n## Collateral Arrangements\n\nMost of our counterparty collateral arrangements require cash collateral posting by AT&amp;T only when derivative market values exceed certain thresholds. Under these arrangements, which cover the majority of our $34,884 derivative portfolio, counterparties are still required to post collateral. During 2024, we received $477 of cash collateral, on a net basis. Cash postings under these arrangements vary with changes in credit ratings and netting agreements. (See Note 12)\n\n## Other\n\nOur total capital consists of debt (long-term debt and debt maturing within one year), redeemable noncontrolling interest and stockholders' equity. Our capital structure does not include debt issued by our equity method investments. At December 31, 2024, our debt ratio was 50.7%, compared to 53.5% at December 31, 2023 and 56.1% at December 31, 2022. The debt ratio is affected by the same factors that affect total capital, and reflects our recent debt issuances, repayments and reclassifications related to redemption of noncontrolling interests.",

      "question": "How did the change in CMCSA's Sky segment expenses in 2022, particularly in programming and production costs, influence the Media segment's programming and production costs in 2023, and what were the specific cost shifts related to international sports events between these years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Sky segment saw a decrease in programming and production costs, partially offset by increases in direct network costs and other expenses, as noted in the consolidated costs and expenses section of the 2022 10-K. This decrease was influenced by foreign currency translation and cost management in content production. By 2023, the Media segment's programming and production costs decreased overall, partly due to the absence of major events like the Beijing Olympics, Super Bowl, and FIFA World Cup that had driven up costs in 2022. However, international sports programming costs increased in 2023, reflecting the delayed recognition of expenses for European football matches originally scheduled in Q4 2022 but shifted to the first half of 2023 due to the 2022 FIFA World Cup timing. Thus, the reduction in Sky segment programming costs in 2022 contributed to a base effect that made the 2023 increase in international sports costs more pronounced in comparison.",

      "answer": "In 2022, advertising was a key growth driver for CMCSA's Cable Communications segment, contributing to a 7.1% revenue increase to $64.3 billion, with advertising cited as one of the contributing revenue streams. This reflects the segment's reliance on advertising as part of its broader revenue mix. By 2024, however, the Cable Communications segment no longer held any goodwill, as its $16.2 billion stake was fully reallocated, with a significant portion shifting to Residential Connectivity & Platforms, which saw its goodwill increase to $33.9 billion. This reallocation suggests a strategic refocusing away from advertising toward connectivity and platform services, indicating a transformation in the segment's core value drivers and operational emphasis.",

We also sell advertising on our digital platforms and offer various technology, tools and solutions relating to our advertising business.\n\n## Network and Technology\n\nWe rely on various telecommunications providers to deliver video, broadband, voice and wireless services to our customers.\n\nFor a majority of customers, our DTH video platform is delivered via one-way digital satellite transmission that uses satellites leased from third parties for the distribution of television channels and is augmented by a set-top box with local DVR storage and high-speed,  two-way  broadband  connectivity  enabling  interactive  video  services  such  as  integrated  search  functionality,  on demand,  DVR  and  voice  services.  Our  platform  incorporates  Wi-Fi  connectivity  for  in-home  distribution  that  allows  wireless, multiroom consumption. We have also developed a range of back-end and client software applications that provide customers with access to our content across multiple third-party devices.\n\nUnder the current regulatory regime in the United Kingdom, Ireland and Italy, we are able to access networks owned by third-party telecommunications providers for a fee to provide our broadband, voice, and wireless services in many cases, on regulated terms. We  offer  broadband  and  voice  services  in  the  United  Kingdom  using  a  combination  of  our  own  core  fiber  network  and  BT Openreach's core and 'last mile' network under a wholesale and fee-based arrangement and in Italy primarily using Open Fiber's network. We offer wireless services to customers in the United Kingdom using a combination of an arrangement to access network assets from Telef\u00f3nica and our own mobile core network .\n\nWe continue to focus on technology initiatives to design, develop and deploy next-generation media and content delivery platforms, including Sky Q and NOW, that deliver video content, provide advanced search capabilities, including through a voice-activated remote control, and provide access to and integration of certain other DTC streaming services. These platforms and, more recently, Sky Glass leverage our global technology platform. Sky Glass is a smart television that we launched in the fourth quarter of 2021 in the  United  Kingdom,  with  an  operating  system  that  provides  a  video  service  similar  to  Sky  Q  over  a  broadband  connection, eliminating the need for a satellite dish or set-top box.\n\n## Sources of Supply and Other Operations\n\n## Programming\n\nOur owned television channels and NOW streaming service include content both owned by us and licensed from third parties and NBCUniversal. In some cases, licenses  are  on  an  exclusive  basis. We  have  various  multiyear  contractual  commitments  for  the licensing  of  programming,  primarily  sports  rights  and  exclusive  entertainment  content.  Our  most  significant  sports  rights commitments include  European  football  broadcast  rights  for  Premier  League  games  through  the  2024-25  season  in  the  United Kingdom and Bundesliga games through the 2024-25 season in Germany. We also have broadcast rights to Formula One through 2024 in the United Kingdom and Germany and through 2022 in Italy, English and Wales Cricket Board cricket games through 2024 in the United Kingdom, and Union of European Football Associations Champions League ('UCL') through the 2023-24 season in Italy, as well as non-exclusive broadcast rights to certain Serie A games through the 2023-24 season in Italy.\n\nOur  most  significant  commitments  for  the  licensing  of  film  and  television  entertainment  content  include  exclusive  rights  with HBO, Paramount, Warner  Bros.  and  NBCUniversal.  We  also  produce  and  air  live  news  and  sports  programming  and  produce certain original programming through Sky Studios. We are increasingly creating and investing in original scripted content that is broadcast across all of our territories and sold to other markets. We also are constructing a new studio production facility in Elstree, U.K.\n\nTo offer video services, in addition to our owned channels, we license substantial amounts of programming from third parties. The fees associated with these programming distribution agreements are generally based on the number of customers that are able to watch the programming and the platforms on which the content is provided. We seek to include in distribution agreements the rights to offer such programming through multiple delivery platforms, such as through our on demand services, mobile apps and our NOW streaming service.\n\n## Other\n\nWe purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant amount of customer premise equipment, including set-top boxes, wireless hubs and network equipment to provide our video and broadband services to residential and business customers. We also purchase from a limited number of suppliers a significant number of wireless handsets and tablets that are sold to customers that receive our wireless services.\n\nWe offer direct-to-consumer services to residential and business customers through our customer service teams, customer service centers, websites, telemarketing, and a limited number of retail stores, as well as through advertising via direct mail,",

For more information about our company's operations and the risks facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2021, and all amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Refer to Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, with the exception of the discussion and analysis related to our NBCUniversal segments, which is included below for all periods based on the updated segment structure.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications;  (2)  NBCUniversal  in  three  reportable  business  segments:  Media,  Studios  and  Theme  Parks  (collectively,  the 'NBCUniversal segments'); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment.\n\n## 2021 Developments\n\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:\n\n## Cable Communications\n\n- Revenue increased 7.1% to $64.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2% to $28.1 billion primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and technical and product support expenses.\n- Operating margin increased from 42.1% to 43.7%.",

By 2023, health & welfare contributions dropped to $299 million, while total contributions only decreased to $615 million despite a significant drop in pension plan contributions from $402 million to $316 million.

      "answer": "Disney's postretirement medical plan obligations showed consistent long-term projections from 2023 to 2024, with 2025\u20132034 estimated payouts increasing only slightly from $51M to $52M in 2025 and proportionally through 2034. Despite these long-term obligations, the net actuarial loss (gain) for postretirement medical plans remained unchanged at $(190M) in both years, and the 'Total amounts included in AOCI' from these plans also stayed constant at $(657M). This suggests that Disney's pension valuation assumptions remained stable year-over-year, indicating consistent actuarial modeling and potentially limited near-term financial risk from changes in healthcare cost trends or demographic assumptions affecting postretirement benefits.",

      "question": "How did the decline in Business Wireline revenue from 2022 to 2023 impact the overall Segment Operating Income performance for T, and what does this suggest about the segment's profitability trajectory?",
      "answer": "In 2022, T's Business Wireline segment generated $22,538 million in revenue with a corresponding Segment Operating Income of $2,290 million. By 2023, Business Wireline revenue declined to $20,883 million, and the Segment Operating Income from this segment dropped significantly to $1,289 million\u2014a 43.7% year-over-year decrease. This sharp decline in profitability for Business Wireline contributed to a relatively modest overall increase in T's total Segment Operating Income from $26,736 million in 2022 to $27,801 million in 2023, driven primarily by strong performance in the Mobility segment. The disproportionate drop in Business Wireline's operating income compared to its revenue decline suggests rising costs or margin pressures specific to this segment.",

        "Hop 1: T(2022) \u2192 Business Wireline: In 2022, Business Wireline had $22,538 million in revenue and contributed to the company's segment structure.",

        "Hop 3: Segment Operating Income \u2190 T(2023): In 2023, T's total Segment Operating Income was $27,801 million, with Business Wireline contributing only $1,289 million, compared to $2,290 million the prior year."

      "question": "How did the evolution of T's Mobility segment's contribution to the Communications Segment between 2022 and 2024 impact the overall profitability and margin performance of the Communications Segment during that period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, T's Mobility segment generated $71,056 million in revenue and contributed $22,321 million to the Communications Segment, playing a central role in the segment\u2019s overall performance. By 2024, the Communications Segment's total operating income had increased to $27,095 million from $26,736 million in 2022, indicating a slight rise in profitability. Meanwhile, Mobility's operating income grew from $23,812 million in 2022 to $26,314 million in 2024, with its EBITDA margin improving from 39.1% to 42.8%, reflecting stronger operational efficiency. This upward trajectory in Mobility's performance likely supported the broader Communications Segment\u2019s margin expansion from 22.8% to 23.0% in operating income and from 37.1% to 39.5% in EBITDA margin, demonstrating how Mobility\u2019s enhanced profitability positively influenced the overall segment.",

In  addition,  uses  of  cash  from  operating  activities include hardware inventory costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.\n\nNet cash provided by operating activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to the net effect of an increase in cash received from revenues and cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expenses, and changes in operating assets and liabilities.\n\n## Cash Used in Investing Activities\n\nCash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of our investments in marketable and non-marketable  securities.  Cash  used  in  investing  activities  consists  primarily  of  purchases  of  marketable  and  nonmarketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.\n\nNet cash used in investing activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to a decrease in maturities and sales of marketable securities, an increase in purchases of property and equipment, offset by a decrease in purchases of nonmarketable securities.\n\n## Cash Used in Financing Activities\n\nCash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from the sale of  interest  in  consolidated  entities.  Cash  used  in  financing  activities  consists  primarily  of  repurchases  of  common  and capital stock, net payments related to stock-based award activities, and repayments of debt.\n\nNet cash used in financing activities increased from 2020 to 2021 primarily due to repayment of debt and an increase in cash payments for repurchases of common and capital stock.\n\n## Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements\n\nWe  expect  existing  cash,  cash  equivalents,  short-term  marketable  securities,  cash  flows  from  operations  and financing  activities  to  continue  to  be  sufficient  to  fund  our  operating  activities  and  cash  commitments  for  investing  and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nFluctuations in our  Google  Cloud rev enues hav e been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of rev enues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and  marketing,  and  general  and  administrativ e  functions.  Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

      "question": "How did the contribution of the Sky segment to CMCSA's international Adjusted EBITDA change between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about the profitability of CMCSA's international operations over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Sky segment contributed $3,099 million in Adjusted EBITDA, which represented approximately 35.6% of CMCSA\u2019s total international Adjusted EBITDA of $8,711 million. In 2023, the reporting structure changed, and Sky was no longer presented as a standalone segment. Instead, international Adjusted EBITDA was reported under 'Residential Connectivity & Platforms' at $26,088 million in constant currency. While the exact contribution of Sky in 2023 cannot be isolated due to this change in reporting, the overall international Adjusted EBITDA margin decreased from 36.0% (constant currency) in 2022 to 35.2% in 2023, suggesting a slight decline in profitability. This indicates that while Sky remained a significant component of international operations, its relative impact may have diminished or its performance may have softened in 2023 compared to 2022.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Sky: CMCSA disclosed Sky's Adjusted EBITDA as $3,099 million in 2022, contributing to international operations.",

        "Hop 3: Adjusted EBITDA \u2190 CMCSA(2023): In 2023, international Adjusted EBITDA was reported under a consolidated segment, obscuring Sky\u2019s individual contribution but showing a lower overall margin."

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Theme Parks segment reported only $2 million in revenue, significantly lower than other segments like Studios ($3,186 million) and Media ($2,330 million), indicating limited operations or reporting at that time. This segment's revenue was primarily tied to guest spending, including ticket sales and in-park spending, as noted in the 2022 report. By 2024, the Theme Parks segment had expanded its operations, generating revenue from guest spending across Universal theme parks in Orlando, Hollywood, Osaka, and Beijing, with additional income from consumer products and licensing agreements. The 2024 report detailed that ticket revenue was recognized upon usage, while annual passes were recognized over the usage period, and in-park spending was recognized at the point of sale. This evolution suggests a significant operational recovery and expansion since 2022, likely driven by increased guest attendance and spending following the easing of pandemic restrictions.",

Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results and therefore are included in the chief operating decision maker's assessment of segment performance.

      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T's Latin America - Mexico segment reported an operating loss of $141M, while 'Certain significant items' costs were relatively modest at $1,162M. By 2024, the Latin America - Mexico segment's operating loss had more than doubled to $326M, and 'Certain significant items' costs surged to $28,031M. This shift suggests that AT&T allocated significantly more financial resources to corporate restructuring initiatives in 2024, even as its international operations in Latin America experienced deteriorating performance. The data indicates a strategic prioritization of internal restructuring over stabilizing underperforming international segments.",

These obligations directly impacted Prior Service Costs, which stood at $467 million in 2023. In 2024, the Prior Service Costs remained unchanged at $467 million despite the growing obligation schedule, suggesting that the company did not adjust its healthcare liability assumptions in line with the increased projected medical plan costs, potentially signaling a strategic decision or an actuarial assumption carryover.",

      "answer": "The Business Wireline segment revenues for T declined from $25,116 million in 2022 to $20,883 million in 2023, representing a drop of $4,233 million or 16.8%. This decline had a direct negative impact on the overall Segment Operating Revenues, which saw only marginal growth from $117,067 million in 2022 to $118,038 million in 2023 (an increase of just $971 million or 0.8%). The significant drop in Business Wireline revenues highlights a structural shift in T's revenue composition, with the segment's contribution to total operating revenues falling from 21.4% in 2022 to 17.7% in 2023. This suggests a weakening position in the business wireline market, which more than offset growth in other segments like Mobility and Consumer Wireline.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney+ reported an operating loss of $4,015 million, driven by higher marketing costs and increased technology and distribution spending associated with market expansion. This is evidenced by a $1,325 million increase in selling, general, and administrative costs, largely attributed to Disney+ marketing, and a $44 million rise in depreciation and amortization from technology investments. By 2024, despite continued emphasis on the Direct-to-Consumer segment as a core part of the Entertainment segment's strategy, the persistent operating losses suggest that while Disney maintained or even expanded its investment in marketing and technology, it had not yet achieved profitability in this segment. The sustained investment in growth initiatives like Disney+ indicates a strategic prioritization of market penetration over short-term profitability.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "In 2022, Sky represented $19.2B in revenue and $3.1B in Adjusted EBITDA for CMCSA, making it a significant contributor to the company's financial performance. By 2024, Sky was no longer reported as a standalone segment and was instead included within 'Corporate and Other' alongside other entities like Comcast Spectacor and Xumo. This change in reporting suggests a strategic shift where Sky may have transitioned from a distinct operational focus to a more integrated component of CMCSA's broader portfolio. The absence of explicit Sky segment reporting in 2024 could indicate either a reduced strategic emphasis on Sky as a separate business unit or a repositioning of its operations under a consolidated corporate structure. This evolution reflects a potential reallocation of capital and management attention away from Sky as a standalone entity, possibly signaling a shift in CMCSA's international expansion or streaming platform strategies.",

Our segment results presented below follow our internal management reporting. In addition to segment operating contribution, we also evaluate segment performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. EBITDA is defined as segment operating contribution, excluding equity in net income (loss) of affiliates and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that management uses to evaluate operating performance. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating contribution nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by total revenues.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, T's Mobility segment reported $78,254 million in Segment Operating Revenues, representing a 7.8% increase from the previous year. In 2023, Segment Operating Revenues for Mobility rose to $83,982 million, though the growth rate slowed to 2.7% compared to 2022. This change occurred alongside a recasting of segment operating expenses in 2023, which increased Communications segment operations and support expenses by approximately $2,400 million in 2022. The recasting, which involved removing prior service credits from historical reporting, likely affected the comparability of Mobility's operating performance across years.

      "question": "Despite Business Wireline transitioning from a profitable segment in 2022 to a loss-making unit by 2024, how did the Communications Segment manage to increase its operating income margin from 22.8% in 2022 to 23.0% in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Communications Segment had an operating income margin of 22.8%, with Business Wireline contributing $3,990 million in operating income. By 2024, Business Wireline had turned into a loss of $88 million, down from $2,290 million in operating income in 2022. However, this decline was offset by strong performance in other segments: Mobility increased its operating income from $23,812 million in 2022 to $26,314 million in 2024, and Consumer Wireline improved its operating income from $634 million to $869 million. These improvements, particularly in the higher-margin Mobility segment, enabled the overall Communications Segment to achieve a slight margin expansion to 23.0% in 2024 despite Business Wireline's deterioration.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: T(2022) \u2192 Business Wireline: Business Wireline was a key contributor to the Communications Segment with $25,116 million in service revenue and $3,990 million in operating income in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Business Wireline \u2192 Communications Segment: Business Wireline is a sub-segment of the broader Communications Segment, and its performance directly influences the overall segment's financial metrics.",
        "Hop 3: Communications Segment \u2190 T(2024): By 2024, Business Wireline had become a loss-making unit with an operating income of -$88 million, yet the Communications Segment margin increased to 23.0% from 22.8% in 2022 due to gains in other segments."

      "answer": "AT&T's operating income margin slightly declined from 23.6% in 2023 to 23.0% in 2024, despite a notable turnaround in the Latin America segment\u2014from an operating loss of $141 million (operating income margin: -3.6%) in 2023 to a small profit of $40 million (operating income margin: 0.9%) in 2024.

      "question": "How has Disney's monetization of Linear Networks content evolved between 2022 and 2024, particularly with respect to internal licensing fees paid by the Direct-to-Consumer segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney's Linear Networks generated revenue primarily from affiliate fees and advertising, and the Direct-to-Consumer segment paid fees to Linear Networks for the right to air linear network feeds and other services. By 2024, this relationship had evolved: the Entertainment segment (which includes Linear Networks) began including an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, reflecting royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues tied to IP created by the Entertainment segment. This suggests a more structured and potentially expanded internal licensing framework by 2024, indicating a strategic shift in how Disney monetizes its Linear Networks content internally, especially through the Direct-to-Consumer segment.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

(4)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenue and segment operating income.\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "In 2023, VZ reorganized its Business segment by consolidating customer groups, resulting in the creation of 'Business Markets and Other' as a distinct unit combining previously separate customer segments. This restructuring was reflected in 2024, where the Business segment was formally organized around three primary customer groups: Enterprise and Public Sector, Business Markets and Other, and Wholesale. The continued presence of Business Markets and Other in 2024 indicates a strategic emphasis on better aligning customer segments to improve operational efficiency and segment performance, as evidenced by the CODM's focus on segment operating income for resource allocation and strategic decisions.",

The CODM  uses segment operating income to allocate resources (including employees, financial or capital resources) and to assess performance during the monthly and quarterly financial strategic review process. When assessing segment performance and how to allocate resources, the CODM  focuses on evaluating whether revenues generated are sufficient to cover variable and fixed costs with an appropriate return on investment. Key decisions considered by the CODM  using segment operating income include prioritization and timing of changes to network technologies, allocation of capital expenditures based on the Company's priorities, geographic expansion of wireline and wireless networks, establishment of key financial and operational targets, pricing decisions, branding matters and people management.\n\nOur segments and their principal activities consist of the following:",

In 2023, the Entertainment segment explicitly stated that amortization of capitalized production costs was included in its operating expenses, specifically under programming and production costs, and was allocated across its business lines (Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer, and Content Sales/Licensing) based on the estimated relative value of distribution windows. The 2023 financial data shows that the Entertainment segment generated $40.6 billion in total revenue, with $2.6 billion from TV/VOD distribution licensing, $3.2 billion from theatrical distribution, and $16.4 billion from subscription fees.

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney's business was significantly dependent on its Theme Parks segment, which included major domestic and international operations. By 2024, while Disney did not own Tokyo Disney Resort, it maintained a financial relationship through a licensing arrangement with Oriental Land Co., receiving royalties on resort revenues. The opening of the Tokyo DisneySea Fantasy Springs Hotel in June 2024 expanded the resort's capacity and likely increased royalty inflows, highlighting a strategic evolution where Disney shifted toward leveraging brand licensing and partnerships in international markets rather than direct ownership or majority stakes.",

However, in 2024, despite gains in Mobility service revenue and Consumer Wireline, the Business Wireline unit experienced declines due to lower demand for legacy services, product simplification, and the absence of cybersecurity revenues following the LevelBlue joint venture.

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

By 2024, the Consumer Segment's total Operating Revenues rose to $103.5 billion, contributing significantly to the consolidated operating revenues of $134.578 billion. The improvement in the Consumer Segment, particularly from Wireless service revenue growth, directly supported the overall increase in consolidated revenues, despite declines in the Business segment.

Our segment results presented below follow our internal management reporting. In addition to segment operating contribution, we also evaluate segment performance based on EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. EBITDA is defined as segment operating contribution, excluding equity in net income (loss) of affiliates and depreciation and amortization. We believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it is part of our internal management reporting and planning processes and it is an important metric that management uses to evaluate operating performance. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating contribution nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by total revenues.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney's Direct-to-Consumer segment incurred distribution costs that included fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air linear network feeds and other services, as well as general platform-related distribution expenses. By 2023, there was a strategic shift toward integrating more sports content into the DTC offerings, which led to specific fees paid to the Sports segment for programming ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+. This marked a change from general platform fees in 2022 to targeted sports content licensing fees in 2023, reflecting a deeper integration of sports programming into Disney\u2019s streaming services.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

      "answer": "The decline in Business Wireline segment revenue from $25,116 million in 2022 to $22,538 million in 2024 contributed to the deterioration in Operating Income, which went from a $2,290 million profit in 2022 to an $88 million loss in 2024. This was driven by both the drop in revenue and the continued high operating expenses, including depreciation and amortization, which increased from $5,314 million in 2022 to $5,555 million in 2024, exacerbating the loss despite a reduction in Operations and Support expenses.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in T's vendor financing payables from $6,147 million in 2022 to $2,833 million in 2023 impact the 'Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities' line item on the balance sheet, and what does this shift indicate about the company's short-term liability management strategy?",
      "answer": "The reduction in T's vendor financing payables from $6,147 million in 2022 to $2,833 million in 2023 was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the portion of those payables classified under 'Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities,' which fell from $4,592 million to $1,975 million. This indicates a strategic shift in how T is managing its short-term liabilities, potentially signaling improved liquidity or a deliberate reduction in reliance on vendor financing. The broader 'Accounts Payable and Accrued Liabilities' line item on the balance sheet also declined from $42,644 million in 2022 to $35,852 million in 2023, aligning with this trend and suggesting a more aggressive approach to reducing near-term obligations.",

We had $169,147 of total notes and debentures outstanding at December 31, 2021, which included Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso, Australian dollar, and Swiss franc denominated debt that totaled approximately $41,249.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $24,630 of debt maturing within one year, consisting of $6,586 of commercial paper borrowings, $10,100 of credit agreement borrowings, and $7,944 of long-term debt issuances.\n\nDuring 2021, we paid $4,596 of cash under our vendor financing program, compared to $2,966 in 2020. Total vendor financing payables included in our December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet were approximately $5,000, with $3,950 due within one year (in 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities') and the remainder predominantly due within five years (in 'Other noncurrent liabilities').\n\nAt December 31, 2021, we had approximately 178 million shares remaining from our share repurchase authorizations approved by the Board of Directors in 2014.\n\nWe paid dividends on common shares and preferred shares of $15,068 in 2021, compared with $14,956 in 2020.\n\nDividends on common stock declared by our Board of Directors totaled $2.08 per share in both 2021 and 2020. Our dividend policy considers the expectations and requirements of stockholders, capital funding requirements of AT&amp;T and long-term growth opportunities. On February 1, 2022, we announced that our Board of Directors approved an expected annual dividend level of $1.11 per share, or approximately $8,000 per year, following the close of the WarnerMedia/Discovery transaction.\n\nOur 2022 financing activities will focus on managing our debt level and paying dividends, subject to approval by our Board of Directors. We plan to fund our financing uses of cash through a combination of cash from operations, issuance of debt, and asset sales. The timing and mix of any debt issuance and/or refinancing will be guided by credit market conditions and interest rate trends.",

      "question": "How has CMCSA's long-term debt financing strategy enabled its continued investment in multiyear sports programming rights between 2022 and 2024?",
      "answer": "CMCSA maintained a stable long-term debt structure between 2022 and 2024, with a weighted-average time to maturity of approximately 18 years in 2022 and 16 years in 2024, allowing the company to fund significant multiyear programming commitments. In 2022, NBCUniversal (a CMCSA subsidiary) had $1.6 billion in debt subject to cross-guarantees, contributing to the company's overall debt of $94.8 billion, which supported its major contractual obligations including programming and production expenses. These expenses were largely driven by NBCUniversal\u2019s multiyear agreements for sports rights such as the Olympics, NFL, and European football leagues. By 2024, CMCSA continued this strategy, holding approximately 37% of cash payments for programming and production obligations due after five years, primarily related to new and ongoing sports rights agreements including the NBA and English Premier League. The consistent long-term debt profile enabled CMCSA to maintain and expand its sports programming commitments across the period.",

As of December 31, 2021, our debt has a weighted-average time to maturity of approximately 18 years and a weighted-average interest rate based on the stated coupons and including the effects of our derivative financial  instruments  of  3.44%. We typically fund and expect to continue to be able to fund debt maturities and interest payments with cash flows generated in our operations; existing cash, cash equivalents and investments; or proceeds from additional external financing. See Note 6 for additional information on our debt.\n\nWe also have significant contractual obligations associated with our programming and production expenses. NBCUniversal and Sky  have  multiyear  agreements  for  broadcast  rights  of  sporting  events,  such  as  the  Olympics,  the  NFL  and  European  football leagues,  which  represent  the  substantial  majority  of  our  programming  and  production  obligations.  Cable  Communications' programming  expenses  related  to  the  distribution  of  third-party  programmed  channels  are  generally  acquired  under  multiyear distribution  agreements,  with  fees  typically  based  on  the  number  of  customers  that  receive  the  programming  and  the  extent  of distribution. As  a  result,  the  amounts  included  in  the  table  above  under  fixed  or  minimum  guaranteed  commitments  for  these distribution agreements are not material and we expect the total fees to be paid under these arrangements to be significantly higher than  the  amounts  included  above. We  have  funded  and  expect  to  continue  to  be  able  to  fund  our  programming  and  production obligations with the cash generated from our operations. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 40% of cash payments related to our programming and production obligations are due after five years, primarily related to multiyear sports rights agreements. See Note 4 for additional information on programming and production costs.\n\nOur other contractual obligations relate primarily to operating leases (see Note 15) and other arrangements recorded in our balance sheet  and/or  disclosed  in  the  notes  to  our  financial  statements,  including  benefit  plan  obligations  (see  Note  11),  liabilities  for uncertain  tax  positions  (see  Note  5),  our  remaining  unfunded  capital  commitment  to  Atairos  (see  Note  8)  and  a  contractual obligation related to an interest held by a third party in the revenue of certain theme parks (see Note 15).\n\n## Guarantee Structure\n\nOur debt is primarily issued at Comcast, although we also have debt at certain of our subsidiaries as a result of acquisitions and other issuances. A substantial amount of this debt is subject to guarantees by Comcast and by certain subsidiaries that we have put in place to simplify our capital structure. We believe this guarantee structure provides liquidity benefits to debt investors and helps to simplify credit analysis with respect to relative value considerations of guaranteed subsidiary debt.",

      "answer": "In 2023, T's Consumer Wireline segment was identified as part of the Communications segment, which accounted for 97% of total segment operating revenues and all segment operating income. The Consumer Wireline segment reported an EBITDA of $4,120 million in 2023. By 2024, the EBITDA margin of the Communications segment increased from 38.3% to 39.5%, with the Consumer Wireline segment contributing $4,530 million in EBITDA. This indicates that the Consumer Wireline segment maintained a stable strategic role in driving EBITDA growth within the Communications segment, despite broader market challenges. The increase in EBITDA margin suggests that the segment's operational efficiency improved or remained resilient year-over-year.",

      "question": "How did CMCSA's cash paid for intangible assets evolve from 2022 to 2024, and how does Sky's $741 million investment in 2022 reflect the company's strategic focus during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA paid a total of $3,141 million in cash for intangible assets, with $741 million of that amount attributed to the Sky segment. By 2024, the company's total cash paid for intangible assets increased to $2,949 million. Sky's significant investment in intangible assets in 2022 highlights its strategic importance within CMCSA's broader portfolio, particularly in enhancing content and technology capabilities. Despite a slight decline in total payments by 2024, Sky's earlier contribution underscores a continued emphasis on strengthening intangible assets to support long-term growth and competitiveness in the media and entertainment sector.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Sky: CMCSA reported Sky's $741 million cash payment for intangible assets in 2022, indicating Sky's strategic role in the company's investment activities.",
        "Hop 2: Sky \u2192 Cash Paid for Intangible Assets: Sky's $741 million payment in 2022 was a substantial portion of CMCSA's overall $3,141 million in intangible asset purchases that year.",
        "Hop 3: Cash Paid for Intangible Assets \u2190 CMCSA(2024): In 2024, CMCSA's total cash paid for intangible assets decreased slightly to $2,949 million, showing continued but slightly reduced investment activity compared to 2022."

      "answer": "In 2024, a reduction in employee compensation expenses contributed to Google Services' $25.4 billion increase in operating income, despite rising content acquisition costs and TAC. This contrasts with 2023, where Google Services had a segment balance of $21,118 million, reflecting a growing cost base that included employee compensation and other operational expenses. The 2024 operating income growth shows a strategic shift where cost containment, particularly in compensation, supported profitability even as other costs increased. This indicates a deliberate focus on optimizing human capital costs to enhance segment performance.",

      "question": "How did the impact of tax incentives on content amortization for NFLX change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the evolution of their content investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, tax incentives reduced content amortization on produced content by approximately $835 million, compared to $719 million in 2022, indicating a growing benefit from qualified production spend. In 2024, NFLX continued to capitalize on tax incentives by reducing the cost basis of content assets, which in turn lowered amortization expenses over the life of the titles. This suggests that NFLX increased its eligible production spend in 2023, leading to a higher amortization reduction in the following year, reflecting a strategic emphasis on original content production supported by favorable tax incentives.",

        "Hop 1: NFLX(2023) \u2192 Tax Incentives: NFLX received $835M in amortization reduction from tax incentives in 2023, up from $719M in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Tax Incentives \u2192 Content Assets: Tax incentives directly reduce the cost basis of content assets, lowering amortization over time.",
        "Hop 3: Content Assets \u2190 NFLX(2024): NFLX continued to evaluate and amortize content assets based on earlier tax incentive impacts, showing a sustained strategic focus on content monetization through group-level optimization."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Critical Accounting E stimates\n\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods. The Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") has defined a company's critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company's financial condition and results of operations, and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments. Based on this definition, we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\n## Content\n\nWe acquire, license and produce content, including original programming, in order to offer our members unlimited viewing of video entertainment. The content licenses are for a fix ed fee and specific windows of availability. Payment terms for certain content licenses and the production of content require more upfront cash payments relative to the amortization expense. Payments for content, including additions to content assets and the changes in related liabilities, are classified within \"Net cash provided by operating activities\" on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n\nWe recognize content assets (licensed and produced) as \"Content assets, net\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For licensed content, we capitalize the fee per title and record a corresponding liability at the gross amount of the liability when the license period begins, the cost of the title is known and the title is accepted and available for streaming. For produced content, we capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs, direct costs and production overhead.\n\nBased on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns, we amortize the content assets (licensed and produced) in 'Cost of revenues' on the Consolidated Statements of Operations over the shorter of each title's contractual window of availability or estimated period of use or ten years, beginning with the month of first availability. The amortization is on an accelerated basis, as we typically ex pect more upfront viewing, and film amortization is more accelerated than TV series amortization. On average, over 90% of a licensed or produced content asset is expected to be amortized within four years after its month of first availability. We review factors that impact the amortization of the content assets on a regular basis. Our estimates related to these factors require considerable management judgment.\n\nIn the normal course of business, we, or a third-party producing content on our behalf, may qualify for tax incentives through eligible spend on productions. The accounting for tax incentives is dependent on the particular type of incentive, including the nature of the benefit and the location the incentive is earned. In general, tax  incentives are realized as cash receipts and may be received prior to or after a title launches on our service. Upon a title's launch, any amounts we are eligible for through qualified production spend but have not received, are recognized in 'Other current assets' or 'Other non-current assets' on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables. Tax incentives are generally accounted for as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets (presented in 'Content assets, net') and reduce content amortization over the life of the title (as presented in 'Cost of revenues') on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n\nOur business model is subscription based as opposed to a model generating revenues at a specific title level. Content assets (licensed and produced) are predominantly monetized as a group and therefore are reviewed at a group level when an event or change in circumstances indicates a change in the expected usefulness of the content or that the fair value may be less than unamortized cost. To date, we have not identified any such event or changes in circumstances. If such changes are identified in the future, these aggregated content assets will be stated at the lower of unamortized cost or fair value. In addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, or are ex pected to be, abandoned are written off.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe record a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax  assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not they will not be realized.\n\nAlthough we believe our assumptions, judgments and estimates are reasonable, changes in tax laws or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of any tax audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax  assets, in full or in part, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including our past operating results, our forecast of future earnings and future tax able income, and prudent and feasible tax  planning strategies. The assumptions utilized in determining future tax able income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying business. Actual operating results in future years could differ from our current assumptions, judgments and estimates.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, T's Consumer Wireline segment showed steady improvement, with operating income increasing from $634 million in 2022 to $869 million in 2024, a 37% increase. Over the same period, the Consumer Wireline operating income margin improved from 5.0% in 2022 to 6.4% in 2024. This improvement in the Consumer Wireline segment's profitability directly contributed to the overall Communications Segment maintaining a relatively stable operating income margin (23.0% in 2024 vs. 22.8% in 2022), despite declining performance in the Business Wireline segment which saw its margin drop from 10.2% in 2022 to (0.5)% in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon reorganized the customer groups within the Business segment, which included the Business Markets and Other unit. By 2024, this group saw an increase in revenue driven by a $486 million rise in Wireless service revenue, attributed to pricing actions and growth in the FWA subscriber base. However, this growth was partially offset by a $89 million decline linked to the shutdown of the BlueJeans business offering and reduced traditional voice communication revenues.

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Cable Communications segment reported $23,266 million in Adjusted EBITDA, which was significantly lower than the $34,258 million total Adjusted EBITDA for the company, indicating a decline in its relative contribution. This financial performance likely contributed to the decision to reallocate goodwill in 2023, as evidenced by the complete removal of goodwill from the Cable Communications segment and a substantial increase in the Residential Connectivity & Platforms segment, which received $34.5 billion in goodwill by the end of 2023. The shift reflects a strategic refocusing toward high-growth residential connectivity, aligning with market trends and internal performance assessments.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA's Studios segment experienced reduced content licensing revenue due to the Writers Guild and SAG work stoppages from May to September and July to November, respectively. This led to lower programming and production costs in both the Studios and Media segments. By 2024, the Media segment continued to integrate Studios content, particularly for Peacock, which impacted the total Content & Experiences business. Despite the earlier disruptions, CMCSA planned to offset linear TV declines by growing Peacock subscribers and advertising revenue, while also incurring significant content and marketing costs for streaming expansion.",

We expect that the number of subscribers and audience ratings at our linear television networks will continue to decline as a result of the competitive environment and shifting video consumption patterns, which we aim to mitigate over time by continued growth in paid subscribers and advertising revenue at Peacock. We expect to continue to incur significant costs related to content and marketing at Peacock. Revenue and programming expenses are also impacted by the timing of certain sporting events, including the Olympics in the third quarter of 2024 and our acquisition of NBA rights, which begin in 2025.\n\nOur Studios segment generates revenue primarily from third parties and from licensing content to our Media segment. While results of operations for our Studios segment are not impacted, results for our total Content &amp; Experiences business may be impacted as the Studios segment licenses content to the Media segment, including for Peacock, rather than licensing the content to third parties. The Writers G uild and the SAG  work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively, resulted in reduced content licensing revenue at our Studios segment and reduced programming and production costs at both our Studios and Media segments in 2023.\n\nWe continue to invest significantly in existing and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, including Epic Universe in Orlando, which we expect will open in May 2025, as well as in new destinations and experiences, which we believe will have a positive impact on attendance and guest spending at our theme parks.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How did the shift in META's reliance on third-party data signals for ad targeting in 2024 impact the performance and monetization potential of the Family of Apps segment compared to 2023, especially in light of regulatory and platform-driven restrictions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, META's Family of Apps segment accounted for the vast majority of its revenue generation, primarily through advertising, with 80% of total costs and expenses recognized in this segment. However, in 2024, regulatory developments such as the GDPR, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, along with platform changes from Apple and Google, restricted META's ability to use third-party data signals for ad targeting and measurement. These changes led to a decline in the relevance and effectiveness of ads, which directly and negatively impacted advertising revenue. META introduced new models, such as the 'subscription for no ads' offering in Europe and options for less personalized ads, but these were less effective and resulted in reduced advertiser budgets, particularly in response to iOS changes from 2021 onwards.",

        "Hop 1: META(2023) \u2192 Family of Apps: In 2023, 80% of total costs and expenses were recognized in the Family of Apps segment, which generated substantially all of META\u2019s revenue through advertising.",
        "Hop 2: Family of Apps \u2192 Advertising Revenue: The Family of Apps (including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger) was the primary vehicle for generating advertising revenue through targeted ad placements.",

For example, legislative and regulatory developments, such as the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and U.S. state privacy laws, including the CCPA, have impacted, and we expect will continue to impact, our ability to use such signals in our ad products. In particular, we have seen increases in the number of users opting to control certain types of ad targeting in Europe following product changes implemented in connection with our GDPR and ePrivacy Directive compliance, and we have introduced product changes that limit data signal use for certain users in California following adoption of the CCPA. Other U.S. state privacy laws, such as the Texas Data Privacy and Security Act, the Colorado Privacy Act, and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act, are introducing additional rights for users and could result in restrictions  on  our  use  of  signals  from  third-party  apps  and  websites  through  certain  browser-  and  device-based  universal  opt-out  mechanisms.  Judicial  and regulatory guidance, decisions, or enforcement actions, or new legislation in these or other jurisdictions may require us to make additional changes to our products in the future that further reduce our ability to use these signals, which has occurred in the past. For example, in response to regulatory developments in Europe, we announced plans to change the legal basis for behavioral advertising on Facebook and Instagram in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland from \"legitimate interests\" to \"consent,\" and in November 2023 we began offering users in the region a \"subscription for no ads\" alternative. We are engaging with regulators on our consent model, including regarding compliance with requirements under the GDPR, DMA, and EU consumer laws. For example, in March 2024, the European Commission opened formal proceedings regarding the compliance of our \"subscription for no ads\" model with requirements under the DMA, and it issued preliminary findings in July 2024. In addition, the European Data Protection Board has published an opinion on the operation of such models under GDPR and European consumer protection organizations have raised concerns regarding our compliance with consumer protection laws. In response to these developments, in November 2024, we began offering users in the European Union, European Economic Area, and Switzerland who elect to continue using our services free-of-charge, supported by ads, an option to see less personalized ads, which are expected to be less relevant and effective than our premium ad offerings.\n\nIn addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such as Apple and G oogle, have implemented product changes and/or announced future plans to limit the ability of websites and application developers to collect and use these signals to target and measure advertising. For example, in 2021, Apple made certain changes to its products and data use policies in connection with changes to its iOS operating system that reduce our and other iOS developers' ability to target and measure advertising, which has negatively impacted, and we expect will continue to negatively impact, the size of the budgets marketers are willing to commit to us and other advertising platforms. In addition, we have implemented, and may continue to implement, product changes that give users the ability to limit our use of such data signals to improve ads and other experiences on our products and services, including changes implemented in connection with the GDPR, ePrivacy Directive, DMA, and other regulatory frameworks.\n\nThese developments have limited our ability to target and measure the effectiveness of ads on our platform and negatively impacted our advertising revenue. For example, our advertising revenue has been negatively impacted by marketer reaction to targeting and measurement challenges associated with iOS changes beginning in 2021.  If we are unable to mitigate these developments as they take further effect in the future, our targeting and measurement capabilities will be materially and adversely affected, which would in turn significantly impact our advertising revenue.\n\nOur user growth, engagement, and monetization on mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control.\n\nThe substantial majority of our revenue is generated from advertising on mobile devices. There is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue to feature our products, or that mobile device users will continue to use our products rather than competing products. We are dependent on the interoperability of our products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that we do not control, such as the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Changes, bugs, or technical issues in such systems, or changes in our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, or mobile carriers, or in the content or application of their terms of service or policies (which they have made in the past and continue to seek to implement) that degrade our products' functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to update or distribute our products, give preferential treatment to",

      "question": "How did the reclassification of the Studios segment within CMCSA's structure between 2022 and 2023 affect the timing and recognition of intersegment content licensing revenue, and what impact did this have on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA reporting?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Studios segment operated under NBCUniversal and licensed content to Media and Sky, with revenue recognized at a point in time when content was delivered, while costs were recognized over the license period. By 2023, Studios became a standalone segment under the new Content & Experiences business, maintaining intercompany licensing relationships. This change resulted in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as profits from internal licenses were deferred in consolidated results and recognized over time as content was used. This shift altered the revenue recognition timing between segments, affecting consolidated financial reporting despite consistent licensing practices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Studios: In 2022, Studios operated as part of NBCUniversal and licensed content to Media and Sky, with revenue recognized at a point in time upon delivery.",
        "Hop 2: Studios \u2192 Media: Intersegment content licensing revenue from Studios to Media and Sky was recognized when content was delivered, while cost recognition in Media occurred over the license period, creating timing differences.",
        "Hop 3: Media \u2190 CMCSA(2023): In 2023, Studios became a standalone segment under Content & Experiences, maintaining licensing relationships with Media, but now resulting in deferred profit recognition in consolidated Adjusted EBITDA."

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\n\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the impact of the 2022 delays in theatrical releases on CMCSA's Studios segment affect content licensing revenue in 2023, and how did this influence the programming and production costs within the Media segment during the same year?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Studios segment experienced delays in theatrical releases due to limited movie theater operations caused by the ongoing effects of the pandemic, which negatively impacted near-to-medium-term results. These delays led to a shift in subsequent content licensing windows, reducing the availability of new content for licensing. By 2023, this translated into reduced content licensing revenue for the Studios segment, as noted in the 2023 10-K filing, which was directly tied to the Writers Guild of America and SAG work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively. These labor disruptions paused productions and further reduced content licensing revenue. As a result, the Media segment also experienced reduced programming and production costs, as the Studios segment licensed less content to it (including for Peacock) compared to licensing to third parties. This shows a cascading effect from theatrical delays in 2022 to licensing revenue reductions in 2023, which in turn influenced internal content spending within the Media segment.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

In 2023, its operating revenues increased by 3.3% to $13,173 million, and its contribution to segment operating income rose slightly to $651 million\u2014an increase of 2.7%. While Consumer Wireline showed modest growth, Business Wireline declined sharply, falling from $2,290 million to $1,289 million in operating income (a 43.7% drop). Despite this, the Communications segment operating income increased from $26,736 million in 2022 to $27,801 million in 2023, primarily driven by strong performance in Mobility, which grew its operating income by 8.6%.

      "answer": "In 2022, T experienced a 17.3% decline in operating revenues compared to 2021, reflecting overall financial pressure. However, within the Consumer Wireline segment, revenues steadily increased by 3.1% in 2024 compared to 2023, which was accompanied by a significant 33.5% year-over-year growth in segment operating income. This suggests that despite broader revenue declines in earlier years, the Consumer Wireline segment became more profitable in the later period. The 2024 financials also included nonrecurring fair value measurements for the Consumer Wireline reporting unit, indicating potential strategic evaluation or impairment concerns, even as the segment showed improved profitability. This evolution highlights a shift in performance and financial treatment of the Consumer Wireline segment over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Cable Communications segment reported $25,270 million in Adjusted EBITDA, which was significantly impacted by the pandemic, including capacity restrictions and delays in sports broadcasting. By 2024, the company reallocated its goodwill stakes, reducing the Cable Communications segment's goodwill from $16.2 billion in 2022 to $0 by 2024, while increasing goodwill in Residential Connectivity & Platforms from $0 to $33.9 billion. This strategic shift suggests a refocusing of resources toward residential connectivity and away from traditional cable services, likely in response to the financial pressures observed in 2022.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Adjusted EBITDA: The company's Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted by the pandemic, particularly in the Cable Communications segment, which reported $25,270 million in Adjusted EBITDA.",
        "Hop 2: Adjusted EBITDA \u2192 Cable Communications: The Cable Communications segment was a major contributor to Adjusted EBITDA, and its performance was directly linked to the company's overall financial health.",
        "Hop 3: Cable Communications \u2190 CMCSA(2024): By 2024, CMCSA had completely reallocated its goodwill from the Cable Communications segment to other areas, such as Residential Connectivity & Platforms, reducing Cable Communications' goodwill from $16.2 billion in 2022 to $0 by 2024."

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney explicitly listed 'Participations and Residual Expenses' as a distinct line item under the Entertainment segment\u2019s operating expenses, indicating a direct recognition of content-related liabilities tied to talent and rights holders. By 2024, this specific line item was no longer explicitly mentioned in the Entertainment segment\u2019s cost breakdown, suggesting a potential reclassification or consolidation into broader categories such as programming and production costs. This evolution implies a shift in financial reporting strategy, possibly streamlining or integrating these liabilities into other cost structures, which could affect transparency for analysts tracking content-related obligations year-over-year.",

        "Hop 1: DIS(2023) \u2192 Participations and Residual Expenses: In 2023, Disney disclosed 'Participations and Residual Expenses' as a distinct line item under the Entertainment segment's operating expenses, directly tying it to content production liabilities.",

      "answer": "The 39% increase in Family of Apps segment operating income from $62.871 billion in 2023 to $87.109 billion in 2024 demonstrates the positive financial impact of the 2022 restructuring initiatives.

This is evidenced by the segment's operating margin increasing from 47% in 2023 to 54% in 2024, showing that the workforce reduction helped reduce costs while maintaining strong revenue growth of 22%.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon made a discretionary contribution of $200 million to its qualified pension plan, which was an increase from $0 in 2022. This contribution was part of a liability-driven pension strategy aimed at better aligning assets with liabilities to reduce underfunding risk. Despite this, by 2024, the projected benefit obligations for the qualified pension plan resulted in an unfunded liability of $1.1 billion, as the fair value of pension plan assets ($6.8 billion) remained below the total defined benefit pension obligation ($7.9 billion). This indicates that while short-term contributions were increased, the long-term pension obligations continued to grow, highlighting the persistent funding gap that requires ongoing strategic management.",

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly , in all material respects, the financial position of V erizon at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company A ccounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), V erizon's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 12, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of V erizon's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on V erizon's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCA OB and are required to be independent with respect to V erizon in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCA OB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures  included  examining,  on  a  test  basis,  evidence  regarding  the  amounts  and  disclosures  in  the  financial  statements.  Our  audits  also  included evaluating  the  accounting  principles  used  and  significant  estimates  made  by  management,  as  well  as  evaluating  the  overall  presentation  of  the  financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Valuation of Employee Benefit Obligations\n\nDescription of the M atter\n\nThe  Company  sponsors  several  pension  plans  and  other  post-employment  benefit  plans. A t  December  31,  2024,  the Company's aggregate defined benefit pension obligation was $7.9 billion and exceeded the fair value of pension plan assets of $6.8 billion, resulting in an unfunded defined benefit pension obligation of $1.1 billion. A lso, at December 31, 2024, the other postretirement benefits obligation was approximately $10.5 billion. A s explained in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements, the Company updates the estimates used to measure employee benefit obligations and plan assets in the fourth quarter and upon a remeasurement event to reflect the actual return on plan assets and updated actuarial assumptions.\n\nAuditing the employee benefit obligations was complex due to the highly judgmental nature of the actuarial assumption relating to the discount rates used in the measurement process. This assumption had a significant effect on the projected benefit obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2023, T reported an Operating Income of $23,461 million, with the Corporate and Other segment contributing a loss of $4,199 million, including $1,162 million in 'Certain significant items' expenses. By 2024, Operating Income dropped to $-4,587 million (a loss), driven in part by a sharp increase in 'Certain significant items' expenses to $28,031 million within the Corporate and Other segment, which saw its total loss widen to $30,997 million. This indicates that the deterioration in Operating Income from a profit to a loss was strongly influenced by the worsening performance in the Corporate and Other segment, particularly due to these significant items.",

      "question": "How did the recovery of CMCSA's Theme Parks segment Adjusted EBITDA from a $0.5 billion loss in 2022 to a $1.3 billion gain in 2023 reflect changes in the operational performance and capacity utilization of the parks, especially considering the lingering impacts of pandemic-related restrictions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Theme Parks segment was still negatively impacted by the lingering effects of the pandemic, including capacity restrictions and temporary closures, which contributed to a $0.5 billion loss in Adjusted EBITDA. By 2023, the segment rebounded significantly, achieving a $1.3 billion gain in Adjusted EBITDA. This improvement was driven by the full resumption of operations across all parks, including Universal Beijing Resort, which opened in September 2021 and operated with increased capacity in 2023. The parks also benefited from seasonal attendance peaks and the opening of new attractions, which boosted revenue and offset previous losses. This reflects a clear temporal evolution from pandemic-induced operational constraints in 2022 to a return to more normalized and profitable operations in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Adjusted EBITDA: The company's Adjusted EBITDA was negatively impacted due to pandemic-related capacity restrictions and closures in the Theme Parks segment, resulting in a $0.5 billion loss.",
        "Hop 2: Adjusted EBITDA \u2192 Theme Parks Segment: The Theme Parks segment was a major contributor to the Adjusted EBITDA loss in 2022 due to operational disruptions from the pandemic.",
        "Hop 3: Theme Parks Segment \u2190 CMCSA(2023): In 2023, the Theme Parks segment rebounded, contributing $1.3 billion to Adjusted EBITDA, driven by improved attendance, seasonal demand, and full operational recovery."

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, revenue in the Media segment increased 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n- Media segment results include the operations of Peacock, which in 2021 generated revenue of $778 million and operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion, compared to revenue of $118 million and operating costs and expenses of $781 million in 2020. We continued to invest in content and grow our customer base during 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced certain ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n- Studios segment revenue increased 16.2% to $9.4 billion, due to increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue and  home  entertainment  and  other  revenue  as  our  film  and  television  production  operations  returned  to  full  capacity. Studios revenue included licenses of content to our Media and other segments, including the impact of a new licensing agreement  for  content  that  became  exclusively  available  for  streaming  on  Peacock  in  2021,  and  the  impacts  of  initial content licenses associated with the launch of Peacock in 2020, which are eliminated in consolidation.\n- Theme Parks segment revenue increased 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the operation of our theme parks in the current year period compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period and the opening of our theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\n- Revenue increased 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue increased 3.1% due to increases  in  advertising  and  direct-to-consumer  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  content  revenue,  which  were affected by COVID-19 in the prior year period and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period.\n- Adjusted  EBITDA increased  20.8%  to  $2.4  billion.  Excluding  the  impact  of  foreign  currency,  Sky Adjusted  EBITDA increased 10.2% primarily due to increases in revenue and decreases in programming and production expenses, partially offset by increases in direct network costs and other expenses.\n\n## Other\n\n- Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA losses decreased from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year period in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses.\n- Resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021. We repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion in 2021. Raised our dividend by $0.08 to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis in January 2021 and paid $4.5 billion of dividends in 2021.\n- Reduced debt by $8.9 billion in 2021 and ended the year with $94.8 billion of total short-term and long-term debt and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Impacts of COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways, with the most significant effects in 2020, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such\n\n## Sky",

      "question": "How did the change in intersegment content licensing revenue from 2022 to 2024 affect the financial relationship between CMCSA's Studios segment and the Media segment, particularly in terms of revenue recognition timing and internal licensing agreements?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Studios segment generated approximately 42% of its content licensing revenue from internal transactions, primarily with the Media segment, and this included the impact of a new licensing agreement for exclusive Peacock streaming content from Q1 2021. Revenue from these intersegment licenses was recognized at a point in time, while the associated costs were recognized over the license period, creating timing differences in Adjusted EBITDA. By 2024, the Studios segment continued to license content to the Media segment, maintaining the same revenue recognition policy, but with no mention of new exclusive streaming agreements like in 2021, suggesting a more stable or mature licensing structure. This evolution indicates a shift from a growth phase in content exclusivity (2022) to a more consolidated phase (2024), where the Studios segment's internal licensing relationship with Media became more routine and less driven by new platform launches.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NFLX's content amortization process was described as complex and subjective, relying heavily on estimates of future viewing patterns derived from historical and forecasted data. Any deviation from these estimates could significantly affect the timing and pattern of amortization. By 2024, this amortization directly impacted the cost of revenues, increasing it by $1,104 million compared to the prior year. This significant rise in cost of revenues reflects a strategic decision by NFLX to invest more heavily in content, which in turn required greater amortization. The 2024 financial disclosures confirm this increased cost burden, aligning with the earlier described sensitivity of amortization to actual viewing trends. This reveals that NFLX's content investment strategy intensified in 2024, and the company likely revised its amortization assumptions in response to actual and projected viewing behavior.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

      "question": "How did the increase in tax incentives from $835 million in 2023 to $899 million in 2024 impact Netflix's content amortization strategy, given the role of viewing pattern estimates in amortization timing?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Netflix amortized content based on estimated viewing patterns, which are inherently subjective and subject to change based on actual viewing behavior. By 2024, tax incentives earned on qualified production spend reduced the cost basis of content assets by $899 million, compared to $835 million in 2023. These tax incentives directly lowered the amount of content amortization over the life of each title. The increase in tax incentives year-over-year suggests a more pronounced reduction in amortization expense, which, when combined with updated viewing pattern estimates, indicates Netflix refined its amortization strategy to reflect both improved fiscal incentives and evolving consumption trends.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complex and subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ from these estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                 | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. We also tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing them to current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result from changes in the assumptions. |\n| We have served as the Company's auditor since 2012.

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Media segment recognized distribution revenue from intercompany transactions with Cable Communications for fees related to the sale of cable network programming and retransmission consent agreements. These transactions were reported as if the segments were stand-alone businesses under GAAP, with revenue generally allocated based on relative value, and were later eliminated in consolidation. By 2023, CMCSA restructured its segment reporting, placing Media under the broader Content & Experiences business and emphasizing intercompany profit consistency in transactions with Connectivity & Platforms. This shift, combined with the updated revenue recognition policies for content licensing (where revenue is recognized at a point in time while costs are amortized over the license period), created a timing mismatch that impacted Adjusted EBITDA. Specifically, the deferral of profits in consolidation due to this timing difference affected the reported financial performance of the Media segment. The evolution of these practices reflects a more integrated strategic approach to content monetization and platform delivery, aligning with CMCSA\u2019s broader restructuring around two core business pillars.",

Our  home  service  group  performs  various  tasks,  including  installations,  servicing  and  upgrades  of customer premise equipment. Customers can use self-service help and support and perform self-installations for certain services.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe compete with a broad range of companies engaged in media, entertainment and communications services in Europe. For video services,  we  compete  with  cable  operators,  providers  of  both  paid-for  and  free-to-air  programming,  other  satellite  television providers, digital terrestrial television providers, content aggregators, home entertainment products companies, and other suppliers and providers of sports, entertainment, news and information that deliver DTC and other OTT streaming services. For broadband and wireless services, we compete with service providers making use of new fiber-optic networks, telecommunications providers, other  internet  service  providers  and  companies  developing  new  technologies  and  devices.  Our  competitive  position  may  be negatively impacted by an increase in the capacity of, or developments in, the means of delivery competitors use to provide their services as well as lowered prices, product innovations, new technologies or different value creation approaches. We also compete with organizations that are publicly funded, in whole or in part, to fulfill a public service broadcasting mandate.\n\nOur owned channels compete for the acquisition of content and for on-air and creative talent with other television networks and with DTC streaming and other OTT service providers. The market for content is very competitive, particularly for sports rights, where the cost for such content is significant.\n\nWe compete for the  sale  of  advertising  with  other  television  networks  and  stations,  digital  platforms,  and  all  other  advertising platforms. Similar to the competitive environment in our Media segment, the willingness of advertisers to purchase advertising from  us  may  be  adversely  affected  by  declines  in  television  viewership  and  the  increasing  number  of  entertainment  choices available.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nOur other business interests consist primarily of the operations of Comcast Spectacor, which owns the Philadelphia Flyers and the Wells Fargo Center arena in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and other business initiatives, including Sky Glass and XClass TV, which launched in the fourth quarter of 2021. Sky Glass and XClass TV are smart televisions with operating systems that leverage our global technology platforms similar to Sky Q, X1 and Flex. We sell Sky Glass televisions in Europe, with the United Kingdom as the first market, to consumers that also subscribe to Sky's video services. XClass TVs are manufactured and sold by third parties and operate on our XClass TV operating system.\n\n## Seasonality and Cyclicality\n\nEach of our businesses is typically subject to seasonal and cyclical variations. Cable Communications' results are impacted by the seasonal nature of residential customers receiving our services in college and vacation markets. This generally results in fewer net customer relationship additions in the second quarter of each year.\n\nRevenue  and  operating  costs  and  expenses  (comprised  of  total  costs  and  expenses,  excluding  depreciation  and  amortization expense) in our Media segment are cyclical as a result of our periodic broadcasts of major sporting events, such as the Olympic Games and the Super Bowl. In particular, advertising revenue increases due to increased demand for advertising time for these events and distribution revenue increases in the period of broadcasts of the Olympic Games. Operating costs and expenses also increase as a result of our production costs for these broadcasts and the amortization of the related rights fees.\n\nRevenue in Cable Communications, Media and Sky is also subject to cyclical advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. Advertising revenue in the United States is generally higher in the second and fourth quarters of each year and in even-numbered years due to increases in advertising in the spring and in the period leading up to and including the holiday season, and advertising related  to  candidates  running  for  political  office  and  issue-oriented  advertising,  respectively.  Revenue  in  Media  also  fluctuates depending on the timing of when our programming is aired, which typically results in additional advertising revenue in the second and fourth quarters of each year. Advertising revenue in Sky typically has seasonally higher audience levels in winter months and increased competition in the summer during major sporting events where public service broadcasters lease the rights, such as the Olympic Games and the FIFA World Cup . TM\n\nRevenue in Studios fluctuates due to the timing, nature and number of films released in movie theaters, on DVDs, and through various other distribution platforms, including viewing on demand, DTC platforms or OTT service providers. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods. As a result, revenue tends to be seasonal, with increases experienced each year during the summer months and around the holiday season. We incur",

Our segments generally report transactions with one another as if they were stand-alone businesses in accordance with GAAP, and these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period. Under the previous segment structure, revenue for licenses of content between our previous NBCUniversal segments was recognized over time to correspond with the amortization of the costs of licensed content over the license period.\n\nA summary of revenue for each of our segments resulting from transactions with other segments and eliminated in consolidation is presented in the table below.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the shift in Disney's (2022 vs. 2024) advertising revenue relate to the role of Linear Networks in generating revenue across the Entertainment segment, and what does this suggest about the evolving importance of traditional advertising in their business model?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Disney reported $13,044 million in advertising revenue, a figure directly tied to its traditional revenue streams like Linear Networks, which in 2024 were explicitly stated to generate revenue primarily from affiliate fees and advertising. By 2024, the continued emphasis on Linear Networks as a core revenue driver within the Entertainment segment suggests that traditional advertising remains a significant component of Disney's business model, despite the industry shift toward direct-to-consumer platforms. This indicates a stable strategic reliance on advertising through Linear Networks, even as the company diversifies into subscription-based models.",

      "question": "How did the evolution of intersegment revenue recognition timing between Cable Communications and Media segments from 2022 to 2024 impact CMCSA's Adjusted EBITDA deferral patterns, particularly with the expanded role of Studios content licensing in Media operations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Cable Communications had significant intersegment transactions with Media, including distribution revenue for programming fees and advertising revenue, with Studios licensing content to Media and Sky at a point in time while Media recognized costs over the license period, creating Adjusted EBITDA deferrals in eliminations. By 2024, Media's intersegment relationships expanded to include distribution revenue from Residential Connectivity & Platforms for programming rights and Studios content licensing remained point-in-time recognition, while Media continued to recognize costs over time, further complicating Adjusted EBITDA timing differences. The addition of new operational components like Xumo (streaming platform JV with Charter) and Sky Germany services in 2024 introduced additional intersegment complexity that likely amplified these deferral patterns.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's intersegment licensing model between Sky and Studios was characterized by revenue recognition at a point in time for content licenses, while costs were amortized over the license period, creating timing differences in Adjusted EBITDA (as seen in the 2022 10-K on page 91). Following the 2023 reorganization into the Content & Experiences business units, the Studios segment became a distinct reporting entity within this structure (2023 10-K, page 72). While the licensing relationship between Sky and Studios remained intact, the reorganization introduced updated segment disclosures that would affect how these intercompany transactions were reported starting in 2024, as the company prepares to adopt new FASB segment disclosure rules. The shift from a legacy NBCUniversal structure to a more segmented Content & Experiences framework suggests greater transparency but also potential changes in how intersegment profits are allocated and deferred.",

      "question": "How did Disney's cost allocation methodology for content creation across distribution platforms change from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to the transition from the DMED segment to the unified Entertainment segment structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022 (DMED segment), Disney allocated programming and production costs across its three distribution platforms (Linear Networks, Direct-to-Consumer, and Content Sales/Licensing) based on the 'estimated relative value of the distribution windows,' with initial marketing costs generally recognized in the platform of initial exploitation (chunk 1). By 2024, under the consolidated Entertainment segment, this methodology remained conceptually similar but became more specific about intersegment royalty allocations (e.g., royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment) and detailed cost components like fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+ (chunk 3). This evolution reflects a more transparent approach to accounting for internal content distribution economics, particularly regarding Disney+'s relationship with traditional networks and sports programming (chunk 2). The change in disclosure matters financially because it provides better visibility into how content investments generate returns across different platforms, which affects capital allocation decisions and segment profitability assessments.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

(3)\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges in the prior year include the impact of a content license agreement termination with A+E, which generated a gain at A+E. The Company's 50% interest in this gain was $56 million (A+E gain) and is included in Restructuring and impairment charges in this table. (4)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenue and segment operating income.\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "In 2022, Netflix experienced a 7% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership, which positively contributed to streaming revenue growth. However, in 2023, this trend reversed with a 1% decrease in average monthly revenue per paying membership, primarily due to changes in plan mix and higher membership growth in lower-revenue regions. This decrease partially offset the 8% growth in average paying memberships, resulting in a more modest overall streaming revenue increase of 7% year-over-year.

          "chunk_text": "\nConsolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 19% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, due to the 11% growth in average paying memberships and a 7% increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership. The increase in average monthly revenue per paying membership resulted from our price changes and favorable fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. Paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 50% as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Our service continues to grow globally, with over 90% of the paid net membership additions for the year ended December 31, 2021 coming from outside the United States and Canada (UCAN) region.\n\nThe increase in operating margin is due primarily to content amortization growing at a slower rate as compared to the 19% increase in revenues in part as a result of delays in content releases due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThe full extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict. See Item 1A: \"Risk Factors\" section set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details. While most of our productions have resumed, certain of our productions continue to experience disruption, as do the productions of our third-party content suppliers. Other partners have similarly had their operations disrupted, including those partners that we use for our operations as well as development, production and post-production of content. Production disruptions and new health and safety protocols and requirements can result in additional costs including additional pay to cast and crew and use of PPE and testing. We will continue to actively monitor the issues raised by the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners and stockholders.  It is not clear what the potential effects any such alterations or modifications may have on our business, including the effects on our members, suppliers or vendors, or on our financial results.\n\n## Streaming Revenues\n\nWe derive revenues from monthly membership fees for services related to streaming content to our members.

      "answer": "In 2022, Google Services' operating income growth was partially offset by increases in TAC, content acquisition costs, and other expenses, despite strong revenue growth. By 2024, TAC remained a key constraint on operating income growth, with the company noting that the increase in operating income was again partially offset by increases in both TAC and content acquisition costs. This indicates that while Google Services continued to scale, TAC remained a consistent cost pressure point, shaping the trajectory of profitability improvements over the two-year period.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The investments  that  we  are  making  across  Google  Services,  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that  are  useful  to  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content providers. Our investments in Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital  and,  in  pursuing  new  strategies,  we  may  incur  unanticipated  liabilities. These  endeavors  may  involve  significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  diversion  of  resources  and  management  attention  from  current  operations  and,  with respect  to  Other  Bets,  the  use  of  alternative  investment,  governance,  or  compensation  structures  that  may  fail  to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\n\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in  product  price  and  performance  characteristics,  and  price  and  feature  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\n\nWithin  Google  Cloud,  we  devote  significant  resources  to  develop  and  deploy  our  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.\n\nWithin  Other  Bets,  we  are  investing  significantly  in  the  areas  of  health,  life  sciences,  and  transportation,  among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\n\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\n\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition. Changes  in  device  mix,  geographic  mix,  ongoing  product  and  policy  changes,  product  mix,  and  property  mix  and  an increasing  competition  for  advertising  may  also  affect  our  advertising  revenue  growth  rate.  We  may  also  experience  a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other factors.\n\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such  as  the  continued  expansion  of  our  business  into  new  fields,  including  products  and  services  such  as  hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increased costs for many aspects of our business. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible  we  may  not  be  able  to  protect  some  of  these  innovations.  Moreover,  we  may  not  have  adequate  patent  or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.",

      "answer": "In 2022, compensation expenses increased significantly, with a $3.5 billion rise attributed to an 11% increase in headcount, which directly affected operating performance across segments. Specifically, for Google Cloud, the 2022 filing stated that the decrease in operating loss from 2020 to 2021 was partially offset by higher compensation expenses. By 2024, Google Cloud reported revenue of $43,229 million, up from $33,088 million in 2023. This growth suggests that despite the rising compensation costs in 2022, Google Cloud managed to scale its operations and improve revenue performance by 2024, potentially benefiting from the increased investment in talent.",

By 2024, this timing mismatch persisted, as disclosed in the segment reporting, where profits (or losses) on intersegment content licenses were deferred in consolidated results and recognized gradually as content was used.

Our  Annual  Reports  on  Form  10-K,  Quarterly  Reports  on  Form  10-Q,  Current  Reports  on  Form  8-K  and  any amendments to such reports filed with or furnished to the SEC under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'), are available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.comcastcorporation.com  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable  after  such  reports  are  electronically  filed  with  the  SEC.  The information posted on our websites is not incorporated into our SEC filings.\n\n## Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThe SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called 'forward-looking statements' by words such as 'may,' 'will,' 'should,' 'expects,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'potential,' or 'continue,' or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed in 'Risk Factors' and in other reports we file with the SEC.\n\nAdditionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and, particularly in view of new technologies, the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any of such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n\n## Item 1A: Risk Factors\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. In  particular,  COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations. For example, as a result of COVID-19, we have at times temporarily closed our theme parks or operated them with capacity restrictions. The creation and  availability  of  our  film  and  television  programming  globally  also  have  been  disrupted  as  a  result  of  COVID-19,  such  as postponements or cancellations of sporting events, theatrical closures and suspensions of entertainment content production.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our businesses also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect  day-to-day  life,  travel  protocols  and  the  length  of  time  that  such  measures  remain  in  place,  global  economic  conditions, current and new variants and vaccination rates and efficacy. It is difficult to predict the extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected.\n\nCOVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below.\n\n## Our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.\n\nAll  of  our  businesses  operate  in  intensely  competitive,  consumer-driven,  rapidly  changing  environments  and  compete  with  a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services as well as entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.",

Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, revenue in the Media segment increased 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n- Media segment results include the operations of Peacock, which in 2021 generated revenue of $778 million and operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion, compared to revenue of $118 million and operating costs and expenses of $781 million in 2020. We continued to invest in content and grow our customer base during 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced certain ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n- Studios segment revenue increased 16.2% to $9.4 billion, due to increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue and  home  entertainment  and  other  revenue  as  our  film  and  television  production  operations  returned  to  full  capacity. Studios revenue included licenses of content to our Media and other segments, including the impact of a new licensing agreement  for  content  that  became  exclusively  available  for  streaming  on  Peacock  in  2021,  and  the  impacts  of  initial content licenses associated with the launch of Peacock in 2020, which are eliminated in consolidation.\n- Theme Parks segment revenue increased 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the operation of our theme parks in the current year period compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period and the opening of our theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\n- Revenue increased 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue increased 3.1% due to increases  in  advertising  and  direct-to-consumer  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  content  revenue,  which  were affected by COVID-19 in the prior year period and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period.\n- Adjusted  EBITDA increased  20.8%  to  $2.4  billion.  Excluding  the  impact  of  foreign  currency,  Sky Adjusted  EBITDA increased 10.2% primarily due to increases in revenue and decreases in programming and production expenses, partially offset by increases in direct network costs and other expenses.\n\n## Other\n\n- Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA losses decreased from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year period in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses.\n- Resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021. We repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion in 2021. Raised our dividend by $0.08 to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis in January 2021 and paid $4.5 billion of dividends in 2021.\n- Reduced debt by $8.9 billion in 2021 and ended the year with $94.8 billion of total short-term and long-term debt and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Impacts of COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways, with the most significant effects in 2020, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively.

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Cable Communications segment faced increasing programming expenses, which were identified as a major risk factor that could adversely affect results of operations. By 2024, this financial pressure was reflected in the restructuring of goodwill, with Cable Communications' goodwill declining from $16.2 billion in 2022 to $0 by 2024, while Residential Connectivity & Platforms absorbed $33.9 billion in goodwill. Additionally, impairment losses increased from $0 in 2022 to $6.1 billion in 2024 within the Residential segment, indicating a strategic shift to reassign value and acknowledge asset deterioration in response to sustained cost pressures and evolving market conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur failure to effectively anticipate or adapt to emerging competitors or changes in consumer behavior, including among younger consumers,  and  shifting  business  models  could  have  an  adverse  effect  on  our  competitive  position,  businesses  and  results  of operations.\n\n## A decline in advertisers' expenditures or changes in advertising markets could negatively impact our businesses.\n\nCable Communications, NBCUniversal and Sky compete for the sale of advertising time with digital media distributors, websites and search engines, other television networks and stations, as well as with all other advertising platforms, such as radio and print. We  derive  substantial  revenue  from  the  sale  of  advertising,  and  a  decline  in  expenditures  by  advertisers,  including  through traditional linear television distribution models, could negatively impact our results of operations. Declines can be caused by the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, increased competition for the leisure time of viewers, such as from social media  and  video  games,  audience  fragmentation,  increased  viewing  of  content  through  DTC  streaming  and  other  OTT  service providers,  regulatory  intervention  regarding  where  and  when  advertising  may  be  placed,  or  economic  conditions  generally.  In addition, advertisers have shifted a portion of their total expenditures to digital media, which can deliver targeted advertising. Their willingness to purchase advertising from us may be adversely affected by lower audience ratings and reduced viewership, which many of NBCUniversal's networks and some of Sky's television channels have experienced and likely will continue to experience, or  from  the  level  of  popularity  or  perceived  acceptance  of  Peacock.  Advertising  sales  and  rates  also  are  dependent  on  the methodology used for audience measurement and could be negatively affected if methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels.\n\n## Programming expenses for our video services are increasing, which could adversely affect Cable Communications' video businesses.\n\nWe  expect  programming  expenses  for  our  video  services  to  continue  to  be  the  largest  single  expense  item  for  our  Cable Communications  segment  and  to  continue  to  increase  on  a  per  subscriber  basis.  Part  of  Cable  Communications'  programming expenses  include  payments  to  certain  local  broadcast  television  stations  in  exchange  for  their  required  consent  for  the retransmission of broadcast network programming to video services customers; we expect to continue to be subject to increasing demands for payment and other concessions from local broadcast television stations. These market factors may be exacerbated by increased consolidation in the media industry, which may further increase our programming expenses. If we are unable to raise our customers' rates or otherwise offset programming cost increases through the sale of additional services, cost management or other initiatives, the increasing cost of programming could have an adverse effect on our Cable Communications segment's results of operations.\n\nMoreover, as our contracts with content providers expire, there can be no assurance that they will be renewed on acceptable terms, or  at  all,  in  which  case  we  may  be  unable  to  provide  such  content  as  part  of  Cable  Communications'  video  services,  and  our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected.\n\n## NBCUniversal's and Sky's success depends on consumer acceptance of their content, and their businesses may be adversely affected if their content fails to achieve sufficient consumer acceptance or the costs to create or acquire content increase.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  create  and  acquire  media  and  entertainment  content,  the  success  of  which  depends  substantially  on consumer tastes and preferences that often change in unpredictable ways. The success of these businesses depends on our ability to consistently create, acquire, market and distribute television programming, filmed entertainment, theme park attractions and other content that meet the changing preferences of the broad domestic and international consumer markets. We have invested, and will continue to invest, substantial amounts in our content, including in the production of original content for NBCUniversal, including Peacock, and Sky, in our films and for new theme parks and theme park attractions, before learning the extent to which they will earn consumer acceptance. In addition, there can be no assurance that Peacock will continue to grow or sustain its revenue or user base or successfully compete as a standalone DTC streaming service.\n\nNBCUniversal  and  Sky  also  obtain  a  significant  portion  of  their  content  from  third  parties,  such  as  movie  studios,  television production companies, sports organizations and other suppliers, sometimes on an exclusive basis. Competition for popular content, particularly for sports programming, is intense, and at times, we may increase the price we are willing to pay or be outbid by our competitors  for  popular  content.  We  also  may  be  unable  to  license  popular  third-party  content  for  NBCUniversal's  and  Sky's television  programming  channels  if  media  companies  determine  that  licensing  the  content  to  us  is  not  in  their  strategic  best interests. For example, content creators have launched and may continue to launch their own DTC streaming or other OTT services, forgoing license fees from us to provide their content directly to consumers, or they may license their content to our competitors on an exclusive basis.\n\nEntering into or renewing contracts for such programming rights or acquiring additional rights has in the past and in the future may result  in  significantly  increased  costs.  Particularly  with  respect  to  long-term  contracts  for  sports  programming  rights  for NBCUniversal and Sky, our results of operations and cash flows over the term of a contract depend on a number of factors,",

      "question": "How did the relationship between CMCSA's in-park spending and its Theme Parks segment evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in light of the increased guest attendance in 2023 and the decreased domestic park attendance in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA's Theme Parks segment revenue increased, driven by higher guest attendance and in-park spending, particularly at the Hollywood theme park due to the opening of Super Nintendo World. However, in 2024, despite continued investment and preopening costs for Epic Universe, the Theme Parks segment experienced a revenue decline primarily due to decreased domestic park attendance, which suggests a weakening in-park spending. This indicates a reversal in the positive trend of in-park spending's contribution to the segment's performance, highlighting a shift in consumer behavior or external factors affecting attendance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2023) \u2192 In-Park Spending: In 2023, in-park spending was a key driver of Theme Parks segment revenue growth, especially at the Hollywood park due to new attractions.",
        "Hop 2: In-Park Spending \u2192 Theme Parks Segment: The Theme Parks segment's revenue is directly tied to guest spending, including in-park purchases of food, beverages, and merchandise.",
        "Hop 3: Theme Parks Segment \u2190 CMCSA(2024): In 2024, the Theme Parks segment saw a revenue decline due to lower domestic attendance, indicating reduced in-park spending despite increased operational costs and preopening expenses for Epic Universe."

      "question": "How did the changes in T's Communications Segment asset balances from 2022 to 2024 align with the financial performance trends in the Consumer Wireline segment, and what does this imply about the valuation methodology applied to Consumer Wireline in 2024?",
      "answer": "T's Communications Segment asset balance was $91,900 million in 2022, showing a decline from $91,976 million in 2021, indicating a reduction in overall segment value. By 2024, the Consumer Wireline segment, a component of Communications, reported $13,578 million in operating revenues (up from $12,749 million in 2022) and $869 million in operating income (up from $634 million in 2022), showing improving financial performance. Despite this growth, the 2024 filings noted that the Consumer Wireline reporting unit was subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches, suggesting increased scrutiny of future cash flow projections amid broader segmental asset declines. This implies that while Consumer Wireline improved operationally, the broader Communications Segment's asset reductions may have prompted a more cautious valuation approach for its subunits.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA's Guest Spending contributed to an increase in Theme Parks Segment revenue, driven by improved attendance at international parks (partially due to the easing of prior-year pandemic restrictions) and the opening of Super Nintendo World at the Hollywood park. However, by 2024, this relationship shifted as Guest Spending declined\u2014particularly in domestic markets due to lower attendance\u2014leading to an overall decrease in the Theme Parks Segment revenue. Despite continued investment in new attractions like Epic Universe (which added to operating costs), the segment faced headwinds from weaker consumer demand in the U.S. and foreign exchange pressures internationally. This evolution shows a reversal in the Guest Spending \u2192 Theme Parks Segment growth dynamic between the two years.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CMCSA's theme parks segment revenue increased, driven by growth in international parks that had previously faced pandemic restrictions and higher revenue at the Hollywood park due to the opening of Super Nintendo World. However, in 2024, the trend reversed with a decrease in theme parks revenue, primarily due to lower domestic attendance and the negative impact of foreign currency exchange rates internationally. This shift indicates that while ticket sales rebounded in 2023 as pandemic-related constraints eased, 2024 saw a decline in both domestic and international performance, with foreign exchange further dampening results. The segment's costs also rose in 2024 due to ongoing operations and pre-opening costs for Epic Universe, contrasting with 2023 where higher guest attendance was the main cost driver.",

These decreases were partially offset by increases in Mobility service revenue and our Consumer Wireline business unit, driven by gains in wireless and broadband services.\n\nOperating income decreased in 2024 and increased in 2023. The 2024 operating income reflects a decrease in operating income from our Business Wireline business unit, partially offset by increases in our Mobility and Consumer Wireline business units. Our Communications segment operating income margin was 23.0% in 2024, 23.6% in 2023 and 22.8% in 2022. Our Communications segment EBITDA margin was 39.5% in 2024, 38.3% in 2023 and 37.1% in 2022.",

      "answer": "Business Wireline's segment operating income dropped significantly from $2,290M in 2023 to $1,289M in 2024, a decrease of 43.7%. Despite this steep decline, the overall Communications segment operating income remained relatively stable, decreasing only slightly from $27,801M in 2023 to $27,095M in 2024. This stability was primarily due to strong performance in the Mobility segment, which increased from $23,812M in 2022 to $25,861M in 2023, and likely continued to support the overall segment income in 2024. The data shows that while Business Wireline deteriorated, other segments like Mobility offset much of the loss, maintaining near-flat overall operating income year-over-year.",

      "answer": "Disney reported a net actuarial loss of $93 million for postretirement medical plans in 2022, which likely shaped its 2024 strategy by prompting a cautious funding approach and specific investment decisions. In 2024, the company made only $95 million in total contributions to pension and postretirement medical plans and did not expect to make material contributions in 2025, suggesting a conservative response to prior-year losses. Additionally, the 2024 investment approach included holding 2.9 million shares of Disney common stock valued at $278 million, while also maintaining $1.5 billion in uncalled capital commitments, indicating a strategic balance between liquidity preservation and long-term growth for plan funding.",

      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T's Consumer Wireline segment had an operating income margin of 4.9%, which increased to 6.4% in 2024, indicating improved profitability in this sub-segment. However, the broader Communications Segment, which includes Consumer Wireline, saw its operating income margin decline from 23.6% in 2023 to 23.0% in 2024. This divergence suggests that while Consumer Wireline improved, other components of the Communications Segment may have underperformed or required increased investment, thereby diluting the overall margin. The data implies a strategic shift where resources might have been reallocated to strengthen the Consumer Wireline business, even if it came at the expense of broader segment margins.",

          "chunk_text": "- In November 2021, we sold our Vrio business unit, which provided video services primarily to residential customers using satellite technology in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n## General\n\nWe are a leading provider of telecommunications, media and technology services globally. The services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies. Our reportable segments are organized as follows:\n\nThe Communications segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n\n- Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n- Business Wireline provides advanced IP-based services, as well as traditional voice and data services to business customers.\n- Consumer Wireline provides internet, including broadband fiber, and legacy telephony voice communication services to residential customers.\n\nThe WarnerMedia segment develops, produces and distributes feature films, television, gaming and other content in various physical and digital formats globally. WarnerMedia content is distributed through basic networks, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) or theatrical, TV content and games licensing. Segment results also include Xandr advertising and Otter Media Holdings (Otter Media). We disposed of substantially all Otter Media assets in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft). (See Note 6)\n\nThe Latin America segment provides wireless services and equipment in Mexico, and prior to the November 2021 disposition of Vrio, video services in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nCorporate and Other reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes, and includes:\n\n- Corporate , which consists of: (1) businesses no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, (2) corporate support functions, (3) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, and (4) the reclassification of the amortization of prior service credits, which we continue to report with segment operating expenses, to consolidated 'Other income (expense) - net.' Costs previously allocated to the Video business that were retained after the transaction, net of reimbursements from DIRECTV under transition service agreements, are reported in Corporate following the transaction through 2022, to maintain comparability of our operating segment results, and while operational plans and continued cost reduction initiatives are implemented.\n- Video , which consists of our former U.S. video operations that were contributed to DIRECTV on July 31, 2021 and also includes our share of DIRECTV's earnings as equity in net income of affiliates (see Note 10).\n- Acquisition-related items , which consists of items associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets.\n- Certain significant items , which includes (1) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (2) asset impairments and abandonments, and (3) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated.\n- Eliminations and consolidations , which (1) removes transactions involving dealings between our segments, including channel distribution between WarnerMedia and Video prior to its separation, and (2) includes adjustments for our reporting of the advertising business.",

      "question": "How did Disney's approach to subscriber-based fees for Hulu Live programming change between 2023 and 2024, and how did this impact intersegment revenue allocations within the Entertainment segment?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Disney's Entertainment segment incurred subscriber-based fees for programming Hulu Live, including payments to the Sports segment and other Entertainment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live. These fees were a significant component of the segment\u2019s programming and production costs, which also included amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights. By 2024, the Entertainment segment continued to manage these intersegment fees, but the structure of revenue allocation evolved, particularly with the inclusion of intersegment revenue from the Experiences segment, which was meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues. This suggests a strategic shift toward more integrated revenue-sharing mechanisms across segments, even as Hulu remained a key part of the DTC strategy. The specific allocation methodology and financial impact of these intersegment adjustments were not quantified in the evidence, but their presence indicates a more coordinated financial approach to content distribution and monetization.",

        "Hop 3: Entertainment Segment \u2190 DIS(2024): In 2024, the Entertainment segment included intersegment revenue allocations from the Experiences segment, reflecting a broader financial integration strategy across business units."

      "question": "How did the reduction in Disney's amortization costs from $1,998 million in 2023 to $1,677 million in 2024 impact the financial performance and strategic focus of the Entertainment segment?",
      "answer": "The reduction in amortization costs from $1,998 million in 2023 to $1,677 million in 2024 positively impacted the Entertainment segment's financial performance by lowering operating expenses, which are primarily composed of programming and production costs\u2014including amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights. This decline in amortization costs likely contributed to improved operating margins for the segment, allowing for greater reinvestment in strategic areas such as Disney+ content development or international expansion of linear networks. Additionally, with lower amortization pressure, the company may have been better positioned to manage its equity investments, such as its 50% stake in A+E Television Networks, without the drag of high intangible asset costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS(2023) \u2192 Amortization Costs: Disney reported total amortization costs of $1,998 million in 2023, including $1,547 million for intangible assets and $439 million for film and episodic costs.",
        "Hop 2: Amortization Costs \u2192 Entertainment Segment: Amortization costs are a core component of the Entertainment segment\u2019s operating expenses, particularly tied to capitalized production and programming rights.",
        "Hop 3: Entertainment Segment \u2190 DIS(2024): In 2024, total amortization costs dropped to $1,677 million, which would have directly reduced the segment\u2019s expense base and potentially improved its financial flexibility."

      "question": "How did the relationship between Google Cloud's performance and compensation expenses evolve between 2022 and 2023, particularly in light of Google Cloud's transition from an operating loss to operating income?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Google Cloud's operating loss decreased by $2.5 billion from 2020 to 2021, with the reduction primarily driven by revenue growth, but partially offset by increases in compensation expenses. By 2023, Google Cloud achieved an operating income of $1.7 billion, compared to an operating loss of $1.9 billion in 2022, representing a $3.6 billion improvement. However, this improvement was partially offset by rising compensation expenses, largely driven by headcount growth. This indicates that while Google Cloud became profitable in 2023, the segment's success came alongside increased spending on employee compensation, showing a shift from a loss-making entity with rising costs to a profitable one with continued investment in human capital.",

While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success.

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney announced significant investments in its Experiences segment, including expansions and renovations at theme parks and additional cruise ships, aiming to enhance guest offerings and drive revenue growth. By 2024, the Experiences segment was explicitly stated to generate revenue from hotel room charges, among other offerings such as theme park admissions and cruise vacations. In fiscal 2024, hotel room night revenue was disclosed as a significant service revenue stream, indicating that the prior year's investments contributed to increased capacity and guest spending in this area. This suggests that Disney\u2019s investment strategy in 2023 had a measurable impact on hotel room night revenue in 2024, aligning with their broader goal of expanding experiential offerings to drive financial performance.",

The fiscal 2023 presentation has been adjusted to conform with the fiscal 2024 presentation. (1)\n\n## 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Walt Disney Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.\n\n## Reporting Period\n\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were fifty-two week years.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2024 presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games",

      "answer": "In 2022, Sky contributed $1.954 billion to CMCSA's Adjusted EBITDA, indicating a relatively strong financial performance for the segment. However, in 2023, CMCSA recognized an $8.6 billion impairment charge related to Sky, driven by a higher discount rate and reduced estimates of future cash flows due to macroeconomic conditions. This sharp contrast reveals a significant deterioration in the financial outlook for Sky between 2022 and 2023, despite prior profitability, highlighting a strategic reassessment of the segment\u2019s long-term value amid external economic pressures.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Adjusted EBITDA: Sky contributed $1.954 billion to CMCSA's Adjusted EBITDA in 2022, indicating strong segment-level profitability.",
        "Hop 2: Adjusted EBITDA \u2192 Sky: Sky was a separately disclosed segment with a quantifiable Adjusted EBITDA contribution, linking its operational performance directly to CMCSA\u2019s consolidated financials.",
        "Hop 3: Sky \u2190 CMCSA(2023): In 2023, Sky was associated with an $8.6 billion impairment charge, signaling a major decline in expected future cash flows and a shift in the company's valuation of the segment."

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

In 2023, the consolidated cash paid for intangible assets increased to $3,298 million.

      "answer": "T's Total Segment Operating Revenues grew marginally by 0.8% from $118.038B in 2023 to $120.741B in 2024. Despite this growth, the Latin America Segment's contribution remained stable at around 3% of total segment operating revenues, amounting to $3.144B in 2024. This segment primarily generated revenue through wireless service ($2.162B) and equipment sales ($982M) in 2024, showing no significant increase relative to the overall growth in total revenues. Thus, the Latin America Segment's performance did not reflect the broader growth trend, remaining proportionally unchanged despite the overall revenue expansion.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney faced increased competitive pressures that negatively impacted subscription fees due to market saturation, alternative entertainment platforms, and pricing constraints (DIS_10k_2023.pdf). These pressures constrained revenue growth and pricing flexibility for its Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) offerings. By 2024, the DTC segment continued to operate under these competitive dynamics but showed adaptation through strategic content licensing and subscriber-based fee structures, including fees paid for programming Hulu Live and other DTC platforms. The segment\u2019s reliance on amortized production costs and licensed programming rights, allocated based on distribution window value, indicated a shift toward optimizing content ROI amid constrained subscription pricing. This evolution reflects a strategic pivot to maintain market presence while managing rising programming costs and distribution partner demands.",

(4)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenue and segment operating income.\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "question": "How did AT&T's 2023 goodwill impairment review for Consumer Wireline relate to the 2024 operating expense outcomes, particularly given the $8,946M in Operations and Support Expenses disclosed for that segment in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AT&T disclosed that the Consumer Wireline reporting unit was subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements due to impairment indicators, suggesting potential financial stress or strategic reconsideration of that segment. By 2024, the Consumer Wireline segment reported $8,946M in Operations and Support Expenses, which was directly tied to its $12,749M in revenues, indicating a high cost-to-revenue ratio of approximately 70%. While the evidence does not explicitly state that impairment findings directly triggered cost-cutting, the persistent high expense levels suggest that despite the 2023 impairment review, no major structural cost reductions were evident in the short term for Consumer Wireline.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Google's Cost of Revenues was $110.9 billion, primarily driven by Traffic Acquisition Costs (TAC) and content acquisition costs, with notable components like data center operations. By 2024, the Cost Structure continued to reflect these elements, with TAC explicitly described as a core component of Cost of Revenues, including payments to distribution partners like browser providers and mobile carriers. Additionally, technical infrastructure costs\u2014such as depreciation, network capacity, and energy\u2014remained significant, indicating continuity in cost drivers. However, 2024's more detailed breakdown highlights evolving emphasis on technical infrastructure and employee compensation expenses, suggesting a strategic shift toward internal operational scaling alongside sustained external distribution partnerships.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon's Consumer segment reported a decrease in total operating revenues, driven by declines in Wireless equipment and Other revenue, despite a $1.8 billion increase in Wireless service revenue due to pricing actions and growth in FWA subscribers. By 2024, the Consumer segment's operating revenues increased by $1.3 billion (1.3%) to $102.9 billion, indicating a turnaround from 2023. This growth was primarily attributed to sustained strength in Wireless service revenue and improved segment performance, suggesting that the prior year's pricing and subscriber growth strategies positively influenced the 2024 revenue outcome.",

      "question": "How did the contribution of the Family of Apps segment to Meta's overall income from operations change between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the segment's evolving profitability?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Family of Apps segment reported $62,871 million in income from operations, contributing approximately 135% to Meta's total income from operations of $46,751 million (indicating a strong overperformance relative to the company's overall income). By 2024, the segment's income from operations rose to $87,109 million, contributing about 125.5% of the company's total income from operations of $69,380 million. This indicates that while the Family of Apps remained disproportionately profitable compared to the company average, its relative contribution slightly decreased, suggesting a potential stabilization or maturation in its growth trajectory.",

By 2024, Health & Welfare Plan contributions slightly increased to $300M, yet Total Contributions declined to $591M. This indicates that while Disney modestly increased investment in Health & Welfare Plans, reductions in other categories\u2014primarily the Pension Plans, which remained flat at $291M\u2014led to an overall decrease in Total Contributions.

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney's Theme Parks segment was a core revenue driver, with Tokyo Disney Resort playing a key role through its licensing partnership with Oriental Land Co. (OLC), from which Disney earned royalties on resort revenues. In 2024, the resort expanded with the opening of Fantasy Springs Hotel, increasing its Disney-branded hotel count to six and enhancing the overall guest experience. Despite not owning any equity in the resort, Disney continued to earn royalties on Tokyo Disney Resort revenues, indicating a sustained but passive financial exposure through its intellectual property licensing arrangement. This evolution shows that while the resort physically expanded and added new attractions, Disney\u2019s financial relationship remained consistent\u2014relying on royalty income rather than direct operational control.",

      "question": "How did Disney's 2023 reduction in SG&A costs, driven by lower theatrical marketing expenses, relate to the increased marketing cost pressures described in their 2024 filings due to competitive forces?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Disney reduced SG&A costs by $487 million, from $2,595 million to $2,108 million, largely due to lower theatrical marketing costs from fewer significant releases. This reduction was part of a broader cost optimization strategy. However, by 2024, Disney's filings highlighted rising marketing cost pressures due to increased competition across its businesses, including for customers, content, and talent. This competitive environment threatened to raise the cost of acquiring and retaining consumers, particularly in the DTC and advertising segments. The 2024 filings explicitly noted that such pressures could 'increase our marketing costs' and reduce profitability, indicating a reversal of the earlier cost-cutting trend. Thus, the 2023 cost reductions were followed by emerging cost pressures in 2024, driven by external market dynamics.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Increased competitive pressures impact our revenues, increase our costs and impact the profitability of our businesses.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney's Direct-to-Consumer segment was still facing significant disruptions due to the pandemic, including production delays and reduced consumer engagement, which constrained its ability to generate advertising revenue (DIS_10k_2022.pdf:page_23:chunk_1). By 2024, the segment had stabilized and matured, allowing it to generate $3,707 million in advertising revenue, a 14% increase from 2023 (DIS_10k_2024.pdf:page_41:chunk_2). This growth was facilitated by the segment's improved operational resilience and the dual-revenue model (subscription + advertising), which became more viable as the streaming platform scaled and diversified its offerings (DIS_10k_2024.pdf:page_37:chunk_3).

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

(4)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenue and segment operating income.\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "In 2023, Verizon reorganized the customer groups within the Verizon Business Group, which set the stage for a more structured approach to serving large enterprises and public sector clients. By 2024, this reorganization had resulted in the Enterprise and Public Sector segment generating $14.2 billion in revenue, accounting for 48% of the Business segment\u2019s total revenue. This indicates a focused effort to enhance service offerings, including network services, advanced communications, and core services tailored to large businesses and government entities. The reorganization likely contributed to this revenue performance by streamlining operations and aligning resources more effectively with high-value customer segments.",

      "question": "How did CMCSA's treatment of distribution costs in 2022 compare with the cost structure reported in the Entertainment segment in 2023, and what does this reveal about their content amortization allocation methodology?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA explicitly stated that distribution costs\u2014such as marketing and theatrical licensing fees\u2014were not capitalized and were instead treated as period expenses separate from capitalized film and television content costs. By 2023, the Entertainment segment's operating expenses included 'distribution costs' as a distinct component of programming and production expenses, with amortization of capitalized costs allocated across business units based on estimated relative value of distribution windows. This reveals a continuity in the non-capitalization of distribution costs but a more granular disclosure in 2023 regarding how those costs are tracked and allocated across distribution channels, reflecting a refined approach to aligning amortization with evolving content monetization strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CMCSA(2022) \u2192 Distribution Costs: CMCSA clarified in 2022 that distribution costs (e.g., marketing, theatrical distribution) were not capitalized and were instead expensed in the period incurred.",
        "Hop 2: Distribution Costs \u2192 Entertainment Segment: The 2023 DIS filing showed that distribution costs were a recognized expense category within the Entertainment segment, with amortization allocated based on relative value of distribution windows.",
        "Hop 3: Entertainment Segment \u2190 CMCSA(2023): CMCSA's 2023 filing included segment-level reporting that detailed how content amortization was allocated across distribution platforms, indicating a more structured view of cost allocation."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Comcast Corporation\n\n## Capitalization and Recognition of Film and Television Content\n\nWe capitalize costs for owned film and television content, including direct costs, production overhead, print costs, development costs and interest, as well as acquired libraries. Amortization for owned content predominantly monetized on an individual basis and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments are recorded using the individual film forecast computation method, which recognizes the costs in the same ratio as the associated ultimate revenue. Estimates of ultimate revenue and total costs  are  based  on  anticipated  release  patterns  and  distribution  strategies,  public  acceptance  and  historical  results  for  similar productions.  Amortization  for  content  predominantly  monetized  with  other  owned  or  licensed  content  is  recorded  based  on estimated  usage.  In  determining  the  method  of  amortization  and  estimated  life  of  an  acquired  film  or  television  library,  we generally use the method and the life that most closely follow the undiscounted cash flows over the estimated life of the asset. We do  not  capitalize  costs  related  to  the  distribution  of  a  film  in  movie  theaters  or  the  licensing  or  sale  of  a  film  or  television production, which primarily include costs associated with marketing and distribution.\n\nWe may enter  into  cofinancing  arrangements  with  third  parties  to  jointly  finance  or  distribute  certain  of  our  film  productions. Cofinancing  arrangements  can  take  various  forms,  but  in  most  cases  involve  the  grant  of  an  economic  interest  in  a  film  to  an investor who owns an undivided copyright interest in the film. The number of investors and the terms of these arrangements can vary, although investors generally assume the full risks and rewards for the portion of the film acquired in these arrangements. We account for the proceeds received from the investor under these arrangements as a reduction of our capitalized film costs and the investor's  interest  in  the  profit  or  loss  of  the  film  is  recorded  as  either  a  charge  or  a  benefit,  respectively,  in  programming  and production costs. The investor's interest in the profit or loss of a film is recorded each period using the individual film forecast computation method.\n\nWe capitalize the costs of licensed content when the license period begins, the content is made available for use and the costs of the licenses are known. Licensed content is amortized as the associated programs are broadcast.\n\nOwned and licensed content are presented as noncurrent assets in film and television costs. We present amortization of owned and licensed content and accrued costs associated with participations and residuals payments in programming and production costs.\n\nWhen an event or a change in circumstance occurs that was known or knowable as of the balance sheet date and that indicates the fair value of either owned or licensed content is less than the unamortized costs in the balance sheet, we determine the fair value and  record  an  impairment  charge  to  the  extent  the  unamortized  costs  exceed  the  fair  value.  Owned  content  is  assessed  either individually  or  in  identified  film  groups,  for  content  predominantly  monetized  on  an  individual  basis  or  with  other  content, respectively.  The  substantial  majority  of  our  owned  content  is  evaluated  for  impairment  on  an  individual  title  basis.  Licensed content that  is  not  part  of  a  film  group  is  generally  assessed  in  packages,  channels  or  dayparts. A  daypart  is  an  aggregation  of programs  broadcast  during  a  particular  time  of  day  or  programs  of  a  similar  type.  Licensed  content  is  tested  for  impairment primarily  on  a  channel,  network  or  platform  basis,  with  the  exception  of  our  broadcast  networks  and  owned  local  broadcast television stations, which are tested on a daypart basis. Estimated fair values of owned and licensed content are generally based on Level 3 inputs including analysis of market participant estimates of future cash flows. We record charges related to impairments or content that is substantively abandoned to programming and production costs. Impairments of capitalized film and television costs were not material in any of the periods presented.\n\n## Sports Rights\n\nWe recognize the costs of multiyear, live-event sports rights as the rights are utilized over the contract term based on estimated relative  value.  Estimated  relative  value  is  generally  based  on  the  terms  of  the  contract  and  the  nature  of  and  potential  revenue generation of the deliverables within the contract. Sports rights are accounted for as executory contracts and are not subject to impairment.  When  cash  payments,  including  advanced  payments,  exceed  the  relative  value  of  the  sports  rights  delivered,  we recognize an asset in licensed content. Production costs incurred in advance of airing are also presented with licensed content.\n\n## Note 5: Income Taxes\n\n## Income Before Income Taxes\n\n",

      "answer": "The restructuring of service credits in 2023, which removed prior service credits from segment operating expenses and instead recorded them as other income on a consolidated basis, likely contributed to a cleaner view of the Mobility segment's operational performance. This change, combined with the increase in Mobility's EBITDA margin from 40.9% in 2023 to 42.8% in 2024, suggests that the removal of non-operational credits improved the clarity of the segment's core profitability.

EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting, and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and EBITDA margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, CMCSA's Technical and Product Support Expenses increased, driven by higher costs for wireless phone service and device sales, which contributed to a rise in overall operating costs within the Cable Communications segment. This increase in expenses directly impacted the segment's cost structure, as it was a significant component of the segment's operating costs. By 2024, the strategic positioning of the Cable Communications segment was reflected in its stake distribution, with a notable shift in goodwill allocation from the segment to Residential Connectivity & Platforms and Business Services Connectivity. Specifically, Cable Communications' goodwill dropped from $16.2 billion in 2022 to $0 in 2024, indicating a reallocation of value and strategic emphasis toward other segments.",

These expenses represent the programming license fees charged by content providers, including the fees related to the distribution of cable and broadcast network programming and fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming rates, and the impacts in 2020  of  adjustment  provisions  in  our  programming  distribution  agreements  with  regional  sports  networks  related  to  canceled sporting events as a result of COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers.\n\nWe expect that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases, although to a lesser extent in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the timing of contract renewals, which will be offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers.\n\n## Technical and Product Support Expenses\n\nExpenses  include  costs  to  complete  service  call  and  installation  activities;  costs  for  network  operations,  product  development, fulfillment and provisioning; the cost of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches sold to customers; and monthly wholesale wireless access fees.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service from increases in the sale of devices and the number of customers receiving service, partially offset by lower personnel costs.\n\n## Customer Service Expenses\n\nExpenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity.\n\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes.\n\n## Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\n\nExpenses include the costs associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings.\n\nExpenses  increased  in  2021  primarily  due  to  increased  spending  associated  with  attracting  new  customers  and  promoting  our service offerings, including advertising expenses associated with the Tokyo Olympics, as well as decreased spending as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n\n## Franchise and Other Regulatory Fees\n\nExpenses represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities, including fees under the terms of our cable franchise agreements.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in regulatory costs.\n\n## Other Expenses\n\nExpenses  primarily  include  administrative  personnel  costs;  fees  paid  to  third-party  channels  for  which  Cable  represents  the advertising sales efforts; other business support costs, including building and office expenses, taxes and billing costs; and bad debt.\n\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense.\n\n## Cable Communications Segment - Operating Margin\n\nOur operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin was 43.7%, 42.1% and 40.1% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While the accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in an increase to operating margins in 2020.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

For more information about our company's operations and the risks facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2021, and all amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Refer to Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, with the exception of the discussion and analysis related to our NBCUniversal segments, which is included below for all periods based on the updated segment structure.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications;  (2)  NBCUniversal  in  three  reportable  business  segments:  Media,  Studios  and  Theme  Parks  (collectively,  the 'NBCUniversal segments'); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment.\n\n## 2021 Developments\n\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:\n\n## Cable Communications\n\n- Revenue increased 7.1% to $64.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2% to $28.1 billion primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and technical and product support expenses.\n- Operating margin increased from 42.1% to 43.7%.",

By 2024, the segment's revenue had declined further due to decreased domestic park attendance and negative foreign currency impacts internationally. This drop in revenue directly reflects a decline in guest spending, which is the primary revenue driver for the Theme Parks segment, including ticket sales and in-park expenditures.

      "question": "How did the contribution of hotel room nights to Disney's Experiences segment revenue change from fiscal 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the recovery of on-site lodging as a revenue driver?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, hotel room nights were listed among the key revenue sources under services, including admissions, room charges, and cruise packages. By 2024, the Experiences segment explicitly called out charges for room nights at hotels as a primary revenue stream, indicating a more prominent role in the segment's financial performance. This evolution in disclosure and emphasis reveals that hotel room nights became a more strategically highlighted component of the Experiences segment as Disney recovered from the pandemic, suggesting a stronger focus on lodging as a core revenue driver.",

Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games\n\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of services include:\n\n- Programming and production costs\n- Distribution costs\n- Operating labor\n- Facilities and infrastructure costs\n\nSignificant tangible product revenues include:\n\n- The sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our retail locations\n- The sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs\n- The sale of books, comic books and magazines\n\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of tangible products include:\n\n- Costs of goods sold\n- Operating labor\n- Programming and production costs\n- Distribution costs\n- Retail occupancy costs\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees are recognized as the programming is provided based on contractually specified per subscriber rates and the actual number of the affiliate's customers receiving the programming. For affiliate contracts with fixed license fees, the fees are recognized ratably over the contract term. If an affiliate contract includes a minimum guaranteed license fee, the guaranteed license fee is recognized ratably over the guaranteed period and any fees earned in excess of the guarantee are recognized as earned once the minimum guarantee has been exceeded. Affiliate agreements may also include a license to use the network programming for on demand viewing. As the fees charged under these contracts are generally based on a contractually specified per subscriber rate for the number of underlying subscribers of the affiliate, revenues are recognized as earned.",

      "question": "How did the $1.7 billion decline in Video segment revenue from 2022 to 2023 relate to the Cable Communications segment's 7.1% revenue growth in 2022, and what does this suggest about shifting customer demand trends?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Cable Communications segment experienced 7.1% revenue growth, reaching $64.3 billion, driven by increases in broadband, wireless, and business services, as well as video and advertising revenue (CMCSA 2022 10-K). This suggests continued investment in infrastructure and diversified service offerings. However, by 2023, the Video segment reported a decline in revenue from $30.5 billion in 2022 to $28.8 billion in 2023 (CMCSA 2023 10-K), indicating reduced consumer reliance on traditional video services. The contrast between these figures suggests a shift in customer demand from traditional video offerings toward broadband and other connectivity services, which Cable Communications capitalized on in 2022. This evolving dynamic highlights changing consumer preferences and the strategic importance of adapting to a more digitally connected and on-demand media environment.",

      "answer": "The Latin America Segment's turnaround from a $141M operating loss in 2023 to a $40M operating profit in 2024 occurred despite an increase in Total Segment Operating Expenses from $4,073M in 2023 to $4,192M in 2024. This improvement was primarily driven by a $300M increase in Total Segment Operating Revenues, which rose from $3,932M in 2023 to $4,232M in 2024\u2014an increase of 7.6%. While operating expenses continued to rise, the growth in revenues outpaced expense increases, particularly in the Equipment segment, which saw a 14.7% revenue increase in 2024 compared to 2023. This revenue growth, combined with a slight slowdown in the rate of expense growth (from 17.4% in 2023 vs. 2022 to 2.9% in 2024 vs. 2023), allowed the segment to achieve profitability in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Disney categorized Programming and Production Costs across four content creation/licensing groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports, and International. These costs included amortization of capitalized production costs, which were part of the broader expense structure. By 2024, the company shifted its methodology, stating that amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights was generally allocated based on the 'estimated relative value of distribution windows.' This indicates a more nuanced and potentially value-driven approach to cost allocation across different distribution channels (e.g., theatrical, streaming, TV/SVOD). The change in methodology suggests a refinement in how Disney tracks and amortizes production investments, aligning more closely with how content is monetized across platforms, though specific dollar figures are not disclosed.",

Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding. (2)\n\nIncludes amortization of intangibles related to TFCF equity investees. (3)\n\nRestructuring and impairment charges in the prior year include the impact of a content license agreement termination with A+E, which generated a gain at A+E. The Company's 50% interest in this gain was $56 million (A+E gain) and is included in Restructuring and impairment charges in this table. (4)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment revenue and segment operating income.\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing",

Programming and production costs include the following:\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs\n- Amortization of the costs of licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n- Selling, general and administrative costs, including marketing costs\n- Depreciation and amortization\n\n## Linear Networks\n\nThe majority of Linear Networks revenue is derived from affiliate fees and advertising. The Company's Linear Networks businesses provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs and/or affiliated television stations that are generally based on contractually specified rates on a per subscriber basis. The amounts that we can charge for our networks are largely dependent on the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide and the competitive market for programming services. The ability to sell advertising time and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand.\n\n## Domestic Linear Networks\n\n## ABC Network\n\nABC Network programming is aired in the primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports 'dayparts'. Primetime programming includes scripted series, reality programming and a variety of movies and specials. ESPN programs the sports daypart on ABC Network, which is branded ESPN on ABC. ABC Network distributes programming to approximately 245 local affiliated television stations and to our eight owned television stations, which collectively reach almost 100% of U.S. television households.\n\nABC Network produces a variety of unscripted series, primetime specials, news and daytime programming.\n\n## Disney Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: Disney Channel; Disney Junior; and Disney XD (collectively Disney Channels). Disney Channels air programming 24 hours a day targeted to kids ages 2 to 14 and generally feature live-action comedy series, animated programming and preschool series as well as original movies and theatrical films.\n\n## Freeform\n\nFreeform is a channel targeted to viewers ages 18 to 34 that airs original and licensed television series, films and holiday programming events.\n\n## FX Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: FX; FXM; and FXX (collectively FX Channels), which air a mix of original and licensed television series and films.\n\n## National Geographic Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: National Geographic; Nat Geo Wild; and Nat Geo Mundo (collectively National Geographic Channels). National Geographic Channels air programming in genres such as travel, adventure, wildlife, documentary, science and history.",

      "answer": "In 2022, T's total Segment Operating Revenues were $117.067 billion, with the Consumer Wireline segment contributing $12.749 billion in revenue and generating $634 million in operating income. By 2023, total Segment Operating Revenues increased slightly to $118.038 billion, and the Consumer Wireline segment's revenue contribution rose to $13.173 billion, representing a 3.3% growth. However, the operating income for Consumer Wireline only increased marginally to $651 million, reflecting a modest 2.7% growth.

Revenues  related  to  cloud  services  provided  on  a  consumption  basis  are  recognized  when  the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\n\n## Google Other Revenues\n\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n\n- Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;\n- hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;\n- YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n- other products and services.\n\nAs it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net  basis  because  our  performance  obligation  is  to  facilitate  a  transaction  between  app  developers  and  end  users,  for which we earn a service fee.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  may  include  multiple  performance  obligations.  For  such  arrangements,  we  allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred and when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).",

      "answer": "In 2023, Disney reported $17,525 million in total affiliate fees, with $7,739 million attributed to the Entertainment segment, which includes Linear Networks. The 2023 filing explicitly stated that Linear Networks 'primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising.' In the 2024 filing, while no updated affiliate fee figures were disclosed, the identical description of Linear Networks' revenue sources suggests Disney maintained a similar dependency on affiliate fees. This implies a continuity in strategic positioning despite broader industry shifts toward streaming, indicating that affiliate fees remained a foundational revenue component for the Linear Networks segment in 2024.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

By 2023, the Other Bets operating loss decreased by $541 million, with the reduction attributed to a decline in valuation-based compensation liabilities tied to Other Bet companies. This indicates a strategic shift where Alphabet moved from increasing investment in early-stage ventures (as seen in 2022) to a more mature phase where compensation liabilities decreased, suggesting stabilization or exit strategies in some ventures.",

While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nOther Bets operate as independent companies and some of them have their own boards with independent members and outside investors. We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

The  increase  was  due  to  growth  in revenues  partially  offset  by  increases  in  TAC,  content  acquisition  costs,  compensation  expenses,  advertising  and promotional expenses, and charges related to certain legal matters.

      "answer": "Disney's financing cash flows from finance leases increased from $41M in 2023 to $44M in 2024, reflecting a modest $3M increase. This increase was part of a broader upward trend in total cash flows, which rose significantly from $770M in 2023 to $933M in 2024, indicating that while finance lease financing played a small role, other components of cash flow (particularly operating cash flows for operating leases) were the primary drivers of the overall growth in total cash flows.",
