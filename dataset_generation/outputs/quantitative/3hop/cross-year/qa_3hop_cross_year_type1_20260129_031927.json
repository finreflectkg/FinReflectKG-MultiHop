      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas reported deferred cloud implementation costs of $43 million, which decreased to $35 million by the end of 2024. This $8 million decline suggests that SO may have amortized or utilized a portion of these costs over the year, indicating a potential transition from investment to operational use of cloud infrastructure within the gas segment. The broader context shows that these costs are part of a larger $321 million total for SO in 2024, suggesting continued strategic emphasis on cloud capabilities despite the reduction in the gas-specific portion.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that its natural gas distribution utilities recovered infrastructure replacement costs through regulatory riders and cost recovery mechanisms, which allowed for the recovery of prudently-incurred costs including a return on rate base. By 2024, the natural gas distribution utilities continued to operate under state regulatory oversight, with specific deferrals of operations and maintenance costs related to software and cloud computing projects being authorized by state PSCs.

The Marketers add these fixed charges when billing customers. This mechanism, called a straight-fixed-variable rate design, minimizes the seasonality of Atlanta Gas Light's revenues since the monthly fixed charge is not volumetric or directly weather dependent.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. Specifically, customer demand substantially increases during the Heating Season when natural gas is used for heating purposes. Southern Company Gas has various mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization mechanisms and weather derivative instruments, that limit exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in these utilities' respective service territories.\n\nIn addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts. In traditional rate designs, utilities recover a significant portion of the fixed customer service and pipeline infrastructure costs based on assumed natural gas volumes used by customers. With the exception of Chattanooga Gas, the natural gas distribution utilities have decoupled regulatory mechanisms that Southern Company Gas believes encourage conservation by separating the recoverable amount of these fixed costs from the amounts of natural gas used by customers. See \"Rate Proceedings\" herein for additional information. Also see \"Infrastructure Replacement Programs and Capital Projects\" herein for additional information regarding infrastructure replacement programs at certain of the natural gas distribution utilities.\n\nThe following table provides regulatory information for Southern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities:\n\n",

Rates for residential electric service are generally of the block type based upon KWHs used and include minimum charges. Residential and other rates contain separate customer charges. Rates for commercial service are presently of the block type and, for large customers, the billing demand is generally used to determine capacity and minimum bill charges. These large customers' rates are generally based upon usage by the customer and include rates with special features to encourage off-peak usage. Additionally, Alabama Power and Mississippi Power are generally allowed by their respective state PSCs to negotiate the terms and cost of service to large customers. Such terms and cost of service, however, are subject to final state PSC approval.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies recover certain costs through a variety of forward-looking, cost-based rate mechanisms. Fuel and net purchased energy costs are recovered through specific fuel cost recovery provisions. These fuel cost recovery provisions are adjusted to reflect increases or decreases in such costs as needed or on schedules as required by the respective PSCs. Approved compliance, storm damage, and certain other costs are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through specific cost recovery mechanisms approved by their respective PSCs. Certain similar costs at Georgia Power are recovered through various base rate tariffs as approved by the Georgia PSC. Costs not recovered through specific cost recovery mechanisms are recovered at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power through annual, formulaic cost recovery proceedings and at Georgia Power through periodic base rate proceedings.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms. Also see \"Integrated Resource Planning\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power Company and certain of its generation subsidiaries are authorized by the FERC to sell power to non-affiliates, including short-term opportunity sales, at market-based prices. Specific FERC approval must be obtained with respect to a market-based contract with an affiliate.\n\nMississippi Power provides service under long-term contracts with rural electric cooperative associations and a municipality located in southeastern Mississippi under full requirements cost-based electric tariffs, which are subject to regulation by the FERC. The contracts with these wholesale customers represented 14.3% of Mississippi Power's total operating revenues in 2021 and are generally subject to 10-year rolling cancellation notices. Historically, these wholesale customers have acted as a group and any changes in contractual relationships for one customer are likely to be followed by the other wholesale customers.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas' natural gas distribution utilities are subject to regulation and oversight by their respective state regulatory agencies. Rates charged to customers vary according to customer class (residential, commercial, or industrial) and rate jurisdiction. These agencies approve rates designed to provide the opportunity to generate revenues to recover all prudently-incurred costs, including a return on rate base sufficient to pay interest on debt and provide a reasonable ROE.\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the earnings of the natural gas distribution utilities can be affected by customer consumption patterns that are largely a function of weather conditions and price levels for natural gas. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Atlanta Gas Light operates in a deregulated environment in which Marketers rather than a traditional utility sell natural gas to end-use customers and earns revenue by charging rates to its customers based primarily on monthly fixed charges that are set by the Georgia PSC.\n\nIn addition to natural gas cost recovery mechanisms, other cost recovery mechanisms and regulatory riders, which vary by utility, allow recovery of certain costs, such as those related to infrastructure replacement programs as well as environmental remediation, energy efficiency plans, and bad debts.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" in Item 8 herein for a discussion of rate matters and certain cost recovery mechanisms.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in Piedmont Segment's prefunded pension assets from $50 million in 2022 to $33 million in 2023 impact Duke Energy's overall pension funding strategy across its operating segments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Piedmont Segment reported a prefunded pension asset of $50 million, contributing to Duke Energy's consolidated prefunded pension balance of $780 million. By 2023, Piedmont's prefunded pension had declined to $33 million, while the consolidated prefunded pension increased to $885 million. This indicates that despite a decrease in Piedmont's contribution, other segments such as Progress Energy (up from $379 million to $396 million) and Duke Energy Florida (up from $143 million to $216 million) saw increases, suggesting a strategic reallocation of pension funding toward other operating segments. This shift may reflect internal capital reallocation or demographic changes within the workforce across segments.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 Piedmont Segment: In 2022, Piedmont had a prefunded pension asset of $50 million as part of Duke Energy's broader pension structure.",
        "Hop 2: Piedmont Segment \u2192 Prefunded Pension: The Piedmont Segment disclosed its prefunded pension balance, indicating its contribution to the overall pension funding strategy.",
        "Hop 3: Prefunded Pension \u2190 DUK(2023): In 2023, the consolidated prefunded pension increased to $885 million, but Piedmont's share dropped to $33 million, showing a relative decrease in its role in pension funding."

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that any extension of the in-service date for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 would result in additional base capital costs of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per month for Unit 4. These overruns directly impacted Georgia Power, which bore a significant portion of the cost-sharing burden. By 2023, Georgia Power had recorded a pre-tax charge to income of approximately $160 million ($120 million after tax) due to updated cost forecasts and settlements with other joint owners. This demonstrates a clear causal chain: delays and cost overruns (2022) \u2192 increased base capital costs (entity link) \u2192 Georgia Power's financial exposure and charges (2023).",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nAs Unit 3 completes system turnover from construction and moves to testing and transition to operations, ongoing and potential future challenges include completion of construction remediation work, completion of work packages, including inspection records, and other documentation necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs and begin fuel load, and final component and pre-operational tests. As Unit 4 progresses through construction and continues to transition into testing, ongoing and potential future challenges include the pace and quality of electrical installation, availability of craft and supervisory resources, including the temporary diversion of such resources to support Unit 3 construction efforts, and the pace of work package closures and system turnovers. As construction, including subcontract work, continues on both Units 3 and 4, ongoing or future challenges include management of contractors and vendors; subcontractor performance; supervision of craft labor and related productivity, particularly in the installation of electrical, mechanical, and instrumentation and controls commodities, ability to attract and retain craft labor, and/or related cost escalation; and procurement and related installation. New challenges may arise, particularly as Units 3 and 4 move into initial testing and start-up, which may result in required engineering changes or remediation related to plant systems, structures, or components (some of which are based on new technology that only within the last few years began initial operation in the global nuclear industry at this scale). The ongoing and potential future challenges described above may change the projected schedule and estimated cost.\n\nThere have been technical and procedural challenges to the construction and licensing of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 at the federal and state level and additional challenges may arise. Processes are in place that are designed to ensure compliance with the requirements specified in the Westinghouse Design Control Document and the combined construction and operating licenses, including inspections by Southern Nuclear and the NRC that occur throughout construction. In connection with the additional construction remediation work described above, Southern Nuclear reviewed the project's construction quality programs and, where needed, is implementing improvement plans consistent with these processes. On November 17, 2021, the NRC issued the final significance report on its special inspection to review the root cause of this additional construction remediation work and the corresponding corrective action plans with two findings of low to moderate safety significance. Southern Nuclear had already identified and self-reported many of the issues in this report to the NRC and implemented corrective-action plans to resolve these issues. The NRC will conduct a follow-up inspection on these findings at a future date. Findings resulting from this or other inspections could require additional remediation and/or further NRC oversight. In addition, certain license amendment requests have been filed and approved or are pending before the NRC.\n\nThe site work plan currently targets fuel load for Units 3 and 4 in the second quarter 2022 and the fourth quarter 2022, respectively. Various design and other licensing-based compliance matters, including the timely submittal by Southern Nuclear of the ITAAC documentation for each unit and the related reviews and approvals by the NRC necessary to support NRC authorization to load fuel, have arisen or may arise, which may result in additional license amendments or require other resolution. If any license amendment requests or other licensing-based compliance issues, including inspections and ITAACs, are not resolved in a timely manner, there may be delays in the project schedule that could result in increased costs.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time. However, any extension of the in-service date beyond the first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 or the fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4, including the current level of cost sharing described below, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described below, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.\n\n## Joint Owner Contracts\n\nIn November 2017, the Vogtle Owners entered into an amendment to their joint ownership agreements for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to provide for, among other conditions, additional Vogtle Owner approval requirements. Effective in August 2018, the Vogtle Owners further amended the joint ownership agreements to clarify and provide procedures for certain provisions of the joint ownership agreements related to adverse events that require the vote of the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 to continue construction (as amended, and together with the November 2017 amendment, the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements). The Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements also confirm that the Vogtle Owners' sole recourse against Georgia Power or Southern Nuclear for any action or inaction in connection with their performance as agent for the Vogtle Owners is limited to removal of Georgia Power and/or Southern Nuclear as agent, except in cases of willful misconduct.",

      "question": "How did the Current Post-Retirement Liability associated with the Progress Segment change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about Duke Energy's liability management strategy for this segment?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Progress Segment reported a Current Post-Retirement Liability of $5 million, while in 2024, this liability remained unchanged at $5 million. However, the overall Current Post-Retirement Liability for Duke Energy decreased from $12 million in 2023 to $8 million in 2024, indicating that the company reduced its current liabilities in other segments. This suggests that Duke Energy's liability management strategy focused on reducing obligations in segments outside of Progress Energy.",

      "question": "How did the change in Southern Company's Maximum Expected Volume of natural gas subject to operational constraints from 2022 to 2024 impact Alabama Power's derivative liabilities related to energy-related hedging instruments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company reported a Maximum Expected Volume of 26 million mmBtu of natural gas subject to operational constraints, with 6 million mmBtu specifically attributed to Alabama Power. By 2024, Alabama Power's energy-related derivatives designated as hedging instruments for regulatory purposes had increased significantly, with current liabilities rising from $30 million to $69 million and non-current liabilities from $12 million to $41 million. This indicates that the operational flexibility tied to natural gas volumes in 2022 may have influenced Alabama Power's increased exposure to energy-related derivative liabilities by 2024, likely due to expanded hedging activities or regulatory adjustments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Maximum Expected Volume: Southern Company reported a total Maximum Expected Volume of 26 million mmBtu, with 6 million mmBtu attributed to Alabama Power.",
        "Hop 2: Maximum Expected Volume \u2192 Alabama Power: The volume of natural gas Alabama Power could sell back due to operational constraints directly impacted its operational flexibility and exposure to energy markets.",
        "Hop 3: Alabama Power \u2190 SO(2024): By 2024, Alabama Power's energy-related derivative liabilities had increased significantly, with current liabilities rising from $30 million to $69 million and non-current from $12 million to $41 million."

By 2024, the company had implemented specific recovery mechanisms, such as the i-CDP program with $0.6 billion annual capital investments from 2025\u20132027 and surcharge adjustments tied to annual filings. Additionally, Virginia Natural Gas filed for a $63 million rate increase in 2024, including $17 million for SAVE program investments, reflecting a strategic shift toward structured, forward-looking recovery aligned with infrastructure and technology spending. This evolution shows a deliberate alignment between the recognition of ratemaking amounts and the implementation of formalized recovery mechanisms.",

The i-CDP allows capital investments totaling approximately $0.6 billion annually for the years 2025 through 2027 with related revenue requirement recovery through either the annual GRAM filing or the System Reinforcement Rider surcharge adjustment. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved a surcharge recovery mechanism for capital projects related to municipal, county, and Georgia Department of Transportation infrastructure work. Rate changes associated with the new surcharge will be based on requests filed annually on September 1. If approved, new rates will become effective January 1 of the following year.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nIn August 2023, the Virginia Commission approved a stipulation related to Virginia Natural Gas' August 2022 general base rate case filing, which allowed for a $48 million increase in annual base rate revenues based on an ROE of 9.70% and an equity ratio of 49.06%. Interim rates became effective as of January 1, 2023, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original requested increase of approximately $69 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates effective September 1, 2023 and the interim rates were completed during the fourth quarter 2023.\n\nOn August 1, 2024, Virginia Natural Gas filed a base rate case with the Virginia Commission seeking an increase in annual base revenues of $63 million, including $17 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, primarily to recover investments and increased costs associated with infrastructure and technology. The requested increase is based on a projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2025, an ROE of 10.45%, and an equity ratio of 54.92%. Rate adjustments were effective January 1, 2025, subject to refund. The Virginia Commission is expected to issue an order on the requested increase in the fourth quarter 2025. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Unrecognized Ratemaking Amounts\n\nThe following table illustrates Southern Company Gas' authorized ratemaking amounts that are not recognized on its balance sheets.

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $17 million.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&amp;P, or Fitch or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit ex posure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their ex posure to counterparty credit risk.\n\nSouthern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investmentgrade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against",

      "question": "How did the decline in Southern Power's energy revenues between 2022 and 2023 correlate with changes in the market prices of wholesale energy, particularly in relation to fuel price fluctuations and contract expirations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Power's energy revenues were influenced by higher fuel prices and active long-term PPAs that included both capacity and energy components. By 2023, energy revenues decreased by $884 million due to lower fuel and purchased power prices compared to 2022, as well as a net decrease in the volume of KWHs sold, particularly under natural gas PPAs. This decline was further exacerbated in 2023 by a 20.8% drop in the price of energy driven by lower natural gas prices, which directly affected wholesale energy revenues. The relationship between energy revenues and market prices of wholesale energy thus evolved from a period of elevated pricing in 2022 to a more subdued market in 2023, with fuel prices serving as a key link in this transition.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Energy Revenues: Southern Power's energy revenues in 2022 were influenced by fuel prices and contract structures, including PPAs with both capacity and energy charges.",
        "Hop 2: Energy Revenues \u2192 Market Prices of Wholesale Energy: Energy revenues are directly affected by market prices of wholesale energy, which are in turn influenced by fuel prices and contract terms.",
        "Hop 3: Market Prices of Wholesale Energy \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, a 20.8% decrease in energy prices, largely due to lower natural gas prices, led to a significant drop in energy revenues, especially after the expiration of certain power sales agreements."

Southern Power's revenues are dependent upon significant judgments used to determine the appropriate transaction classification, which must be documented upon the inception of each contract. The two categories with the most judgment required for Southern Power are described further below.\n\n## Lease Transactions\n\nSouthern Power considers the terms of a sales contract to determine whether it should be accounted for as a lease. A contract is or contains a lease if the contract conveys the right to control the use of identified property, plant, or equipment for a period of time in exchange for consideration. If the contract meets the criteria for a lease, Southern Power performs further analysis to determine whether the lease is classified as operating, financing, or sales-type. Generally, Southern Power's power sales contracts that are determined to be leases are accounted for as operating leases and the capacity revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract and is included in Southern Power's operating revenues. Energy revenues and other contingent revenues are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. For those contracts that are determined to be sales-type leases, capacity revenues are recognized by accounting for interest income on the net investment in the lease and are included in Southern Power's operating revenues. See Note 9 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Non-Derivative and Normal Sale Derivative Transactions\n\nIf the power sales contract is not classified as a lease, Southern Power further considers whether the contract meets the definition of a derivative. If the contract does meet the definition of a derivative, Southern Power will assess whether it can be designated as a normal sale contract. The determination of whether a contract can be designated as a normal sale contract requires judgment, including whether the sale of electricity involves physical delivery in quantities within Southern Power's available generating capacity and that the purchaser will take quantities expected to be used or sold in the normal course of business.\n\nContracts that do not meet the definition of a derivative or are designated as normal sales are accounted for as executory contracts. For contracts that have a capacity charge, the revenue is generally recognized in the period that it becomes billable. Revenues related to energy and ancillary services are recognized in the period the energy is delivered or the service is rendered. See Note 4 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Acquisition Accounting (Southern Power)\n\nSouthern Power may acquire generation assets as part of its overall growth strategy. At the time of an acquisition, Southern Power will assess if these assets and activities meet the definition of a business. For acquisitions that meet the definition of a business, the purchase price, including any contingent consideration, is allocated based on the fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed (including any intangible assets, primarily related to acquired PPAs). Assets acquired that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as an asset acquisition. The purchase price of each asset acquisition is allocated based on the relative fair value of assets acquired.\n\nDetermining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires management judgment and Southern Power may engage independent valuation experts to assist in this process. Fair values are determined by using market participant assumptions, and typically include the timing and amounts of future cash flows, incurred construction costs, the nature of acquired contracts, discount rates, power market prices, and expected asset lives. Any due diligence or transition costs incurred by Southern Power for potential or successful acquisitions are expensed as incurred.\n\nSee Note 13 to the financial statements for additional fair value information and Note 15 to the financial statements for additional information on recent acquisitions.\n\n## Variable Interest Entities (Southern Power)\n\nSouthern Power enters into partnerships with varying ownership structures. Upon entering into these arrangements, membership interests and other variable interests are evaluated to determine if the legal entity is a VIE. If the legal entity is a VIE, Southern Power will assess if it has both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE, making it the primary beneficiary. Making this determination may require significant management judgment.\n\nIf Southern Power is the primary beneficiary and is considered to have a controlling ownership, the assets, liabilities, and results of operations of the entity are consolidated. If Southern Power is not the primary beneficiary, the legal entity is generally accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Southern Power reconsiders its conclusions as to whether the legal entity is",

This reflects a shift from regulatory uncertainty and risk mitigation in 2022 to a more defined cost recovery mechanism in 2023, supported by the Georgia PSC's approval of the Prudency Stipulation and the inclusion of $5.462 billion of remaining construction costs into retail rate base upon Unit 4's commercial operation.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to Plant Vogtle construction risks in 2022 influence Georgia Power's ability to generate and monetize advanced nuclear PTCs in 2023, particularly in light of the IRS temporary regulations on tax credit transferability?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company, through its subsidiary Georgia Power, faced significant uncertainties regarding the construction status and cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as highlighted by Deloitte's audit procedures and inquiries into regulatory and legal risks. These uncertainties could have jeopardized Georgia Power's ability to qualify for and generate advanced nuclear PTCs in 2023. However, by mid-2023, Georgia Power successfully started generating PTCs for Unit 3 beginning July 31, 2023, and also entered into agreements to purchase PTCs from other Vogtle co-owners, recognizing the associated gains as income tax benefits. This progress was further supported by the June 2023 IRS temporary regulations allowing the transferability of certain tax credits, which Georgia Power and Southern Company leveraged to monetize these PTCs, despite earlier risks identified in 2022.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Georgia Power: Southern Company, through Georgia Power, faced significant regulatory, legal, and cost recovery uncertainties regarding Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's regulatory scrutiny of Georgia Power's nuclear construction risks at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2022 relate to Georgia Power's stake in Plant Hatch's decommissioning cost projections and its 2024 strategic decisions around new energy infrastructure investments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company faced significant regulatory scrutiny over Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including independent monitoring, legal risk assessments, and NRC licensing reviews, all centered on cost recovery uncertainties totaling potentially billions of dollars. By 2024, Georgia Power's stake in Plant Hatch showed a decommissioning liability of $1,178 million, with $795 million allocated to radiated structures and $306 million to spent fuel management. This decommissioning burden, combined with the earlier regulatory risks from Plant Vogtle, appears to have influenced Georgia Power's 2024 strategic pivot toward more diversified, shorter-term energy infrastructure investments, including $760 million in battery storage and combustion turbines at Plant Yates, as well as requests to extend the operational life of other plants like Plant Scherer and Plant Gaston. The evolution from nuclear construction risk oversight in 2022 to decommissioning liability planning and diversified generation investments in 2024 reflects a broader strategic shift in managing long-term nuclear liabilities while adapting to near-term energy demand and regulatory constraints.",

        "Hop 3: [Plant Hatch] \u2190 [SO](2024): Southern Company, through Georgia Power, made strategic infrastructure investments in 2024, including $760 million in battery storage and combustion turbines, and sought to extend the life of other plants, likely influenced by the long-term liabilities tied to nuclear assets like Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle."

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Southern Company's exposure to BB+ and/or Ba1 or below rated debt for Alabama Power\u2014from $0 in 2023 to $402 million in 2024\u2014relate to Alabama Power's previously disclosed financial risks in 2023, such as potential uninsured losses and retrospective insurance assessments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power faced significant financial risks, including potential uninsured losses from nuclear insurance policies and retrospective assessments that could reach up to $54 million annually. These risks indicated a vulnerability in Alabama Power's financial structure, especially in scenarios involving nuclear incidents or legal liabilities. By 2024, Southern Company disclosed that $402 million of its debt was rated BB+ and/or Ba1 or below, specifically tied to Alabama Power. This suggests a material increase in sub-investment grade exposure, likely influenced by the ongoing financial pressures and liabilities highlighted in 2023. The jump from no sub-investment grade debt in 2023 to $402 million in 2024 reflects a worsening credit profile, potentially exacerbated by the unresolved risks and liabilities associated with Alabama Power's operations.",

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $17 million.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&amp;P, or Fitch or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit ex posure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their ex posure to counterparty credit risk.\n\nSouthern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investmentgrade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against",

By 2024, Alabama Power disclosed a net derivative liability of $23 million designated for regulatory purposes.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that short-term opportunity sales were conducted at market-based rates that generally provided a margin above the company's variable production costs. By 2024, wholesale electric revenues had declined by $36 million, with energy revenues down $58 million compared to 2023, partly due to lower fuel and purchased power prices. While Southern Power saw increased sales volume under natural gas and solar PPAs, the overall decline in energy revenues suggests that the company's short-term sales strategy faced more competitive or less favorable market conditions in 2024, potentially compressing margins relative to variable costs compared to earlier periods.",

The significant factors driving this change are shown in the preceding table. The increase in rates and pricing in 2021 was primarily due to an increase effective January 1, 2021 in Alabama Power's Rate RSE, net of a related customer refund, and increases at Georgia Power resulting from higher contributions by commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, fixed residential customer bill programs, the effects of higher KWH sales on ECCR tariff revenues, and base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, partially offset by a decrease in Georgia Power's NCCR tariff, both effective January 1, 2021.\n\nElectric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power\" and \"Georgia Power\" for additional information. Also see \"Energy Sales\" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.\n\nWholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.\n\nWholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:\n\n",

Energy revenues decreased $45 million at the traditional electric operating companies and $13 million at Southern Power primarily due to fuel and purchased power price decreases compared to 2023. Partially offsetting the Southern Power decrease was an increase in the volume of KWHs sold primarily under natural gas and solar PPAs. The increase in capacity revenues was primarily due to a net increase in revenues from capacity contracts at Georgia Power and an increase in capacity revenues associated with natural gas PPAs at Southern Power. The changes in capacity and energy revenues also reflect decreases resulting from power sales agreements that ended in 2023 at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power.\n\nWholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales.

By 2024, the net purchased mmBtu decreased to 83 million, yet the Longest Non-Hedge Date remained at 2028.

By 2024, Southern Company's consolidated balance sheet showed total deferred charges and other assets of $841M, though the specific hedging-related disclosures were no longer explicitly itemized. This suggests a broader consolidation or reclassification of deferred assets at the parent level, while the Plant Vogtle cost recovery risks persisted but were likely absorbed into a more generalized deferred asset strategy.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that Georgia Power faced potential material charges if future capital cost increases for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 were not recoverable through regulated rates. These uncertainties stemmed from the significant base capital costs of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per month for Unit 4, along with AFUDC and other construction-related expenses. By 2024, Georgia Power had formalized long-term commitments totaling $35 million related to a 5% interest in Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, indicating continued financial exposure and strategic stake in the facility. This shows a shift from uncertain cost recovery risk in 2022 to a more defined, committed financial position by 2024, with Georgia Power maintaining a direct stake in the plant and associated liabilities.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.\n\nGiven the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)\n\nThe consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.\n\nSouthern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.\n\nCurrent and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.\n\nGiven the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)\n\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.\n\nThe ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property",

Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's nuclear plants.\n\nIn addition, Georgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases totaling $35 million at December 31, 2024, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of Plant V ogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Titles to Property\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) G eorgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) G eorgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Assets Subject to Lien\" and Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See \"Jointly-Owned Facilities\" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor G as' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Distribution and Transmission Mains\n\nSouthern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned approximately 78,500 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.\n\n## Storage Assets\n\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nSouthern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flex ibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facilities are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.\n\n## All Other\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California",

      "question": "Given Georgia Power's $89 million maximum annual assessment under NEIL policies in 2023, how should analysts interpret its $714 million increase in operating cash flow during that year, especially in light of Southern Company's $406 million net cash provided from operating activities in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power faced a significant potential liability of $89 million under NEIL insurance policies, which could have impacted Southern Company's overall financial stability. However, Georgia Power simultaneously generated a strong $714 million increase in net cash from operating activities, driven by improved fuel cost recovery. This cash flow growth contributed to Southern Company's broader financial positioning, as evidenced by its $406 million net cash from operating activities in 2024. Analysts should interpret this as a sign that despite the risk exposure, Georgia Power's operational performance remained robust, supporting Southern Company's cash flow resilience even with potential future liabilities.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Georgia Power: Georgia Power had a $89 million maximum annual assessment under NEIL policies in 2023, representing a material risk to Southern Company.",

      "question": "How did the regulatory scrutiny faced by Georgia Power in 2022 regarding Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 construction uncertainties influence the change in deferred regulatory assets reported by Southern Company in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission over uncertainties in the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including independent monitoring, NRC inspections, and legal reviews. This scrutiny was tied to disclosures showing Georgia Power had $30 million in deferred regulatory assets in 2021. By 2023, Southern Company reported a total of $1,858 million in other regulatory assets, deferred, indicating a substantial increase from $2,107 million in 2022. This suggests that ongoing regulatory challenges and cost recovery complexities likely contributed to the sustained high level of deferred regulatory assets, reflecting the evolving financial implications of Plant Vogtle's regulatory environment.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's approach to managing deferred regulatory liabilities evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to Alabama Power's use of energy-related derivative instruments for regulatory hedging purposes?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company reported total 'Other regulatory liabilities, deferred' of $231 million at the corporate level, with Alabama Power accounting for $48 million of this amount. These liabilities represent obligations that are subject to regulatory recovery mechanisms. By 2024, Southern Company reduced its total deferred regulatory liabilities to $213 million, with Alabama Power\u2019s share decreasing slightly to $45 million. This indicates a more targeted liability management strategy at the subsidiary level. Correspondingly, Alabama Power increased its use of energy-related derivatives designated as hedging instruments for regulatory purposes, with net current liabilities rising from $30 million in 2023 to $69 million in 2024. This suggests that Alabama Power intensified its hedging activities to manage regulatory exposure, even as the overall deferred liability balance decreased. The evolution reflects a strategic shift toward active risk mitigation through derivatives while reducing the overall regulatory liability burden across the Southern Company system.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Other regulatory liabilities, deferred: Southern Company reported $231 million in deferred regulatory liabilities in 2023, with Alabama Power contributing $48 million.",
        "Hop 2: Other regulatory liabilities, deferred \u2192 Alabama Power: Alabama Power is a key segment within Southern Company that holds a significant portion of these liabilities, indicating its central role in regulatory compliance and risk management.",
        "Hop 3: Alabama Power \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, Alabama Power showed increased use of energy-related derivatives for regulatory hedging, with current derivative liabilities rising to $69 million, even as its deferred regulatory liabilities slightly decreased to $45 million."

      "answer": "Alabama Power reported an increase in prepaid other postretirement benefit costs from $74 million in 2023 to $95 million in 2024, which contributed to Southern Company's overall employee benefit obligations decreasing from $(285) million in 2023 to $(212) million in 2024. This reduction in obligations was accompanied by a decline in other regulatory liabilities, deferred, from $(231) million in 2023 to $(213) million in 2024. The increase in prepaid benefits likely reflects improved funding or actuarial assumptions, easing the burden on the company's consolidated liabilities.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's relationship with Alabama Power in 2023, specifically regarding potential liability from NEIL policy assessments, influence the 'Other deferred credits and liabilities' line item in 2024, given the disclosed amounts in the balance sheet?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company's subsidiary Alabama Power faced a potential liability of up to $54 million under NEIL policies, which could have had a material impact on its financial condition. This liability was disclosed in the footnotes and connected to 'Other deferred credits and liabilities' in the balance sheet, which showed $41 million in 2023 for Alabama Power. By 2024, the 'Other deferred credits and liabilities' line for the overall company increased slightly to $509 million, suggesting that while the NEIL-related liability may not have been fully realized, it contributed to the broader deferred liabilities position. The evolution indicates that potential liabilities from earlier years, such as the NEIL assessments, were factored into the long-term deferred liabilities disclosed in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Alabama Power: Southern Company disclosed in 2023 that Alabama Power faced a potential liability of $54 million under NEIL insurance policies, which could materially affect its financial condition.",
        "Hop 2: Alabama Power \u2192 Other deferred credits and liabilities: The 2023 balance sheet disclosed that Alabama Power had $41 million in 'Other deferred credits and liabilities', which included regulatory and insurance-related deferred items.",
        "Hop 3: Other deferred credits and liabilities \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, Southern Company's consolidated balance sheet showed an increase in 'Other deferred credits and liabilities' from $481 million in 2023 to $509 million in 2024."

      "question": "How did the reduction in Southern Company's deferred regulatory liabilities allocated to Georgia Power from $85 million in 2023 to $67 million in 2024 impact Georgia Power's capacity to meet its financial obligations as a subsidiary under Southern Company's continued control?",
      "answer": "The reduction in deferred regulatory liabilities allocated to Georgia Power from $85 million in 2023 to $67 million in 2024 reflects a $18 million decrease in the regulatory burden carried over from Southern Company. This likely improved Georgia Power\u2019s short-term financial flexibility by reducing its share of deferred obligations, which could free up capital for operations or investments. Southern Company's continued control through the Power of Attorney and resolution documentation reaffirms Georgia Power's role within the consolidated structure, where liability sharing and resource allocation remain under centralized governance. This evolution suggests a reallocation of regulatory liabilities within the company's internal financial framework, potentially easing near-term financial pressure on Georgia Power while maintaining the parent company\u2019s ultimate accountability.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Alabama Power's prepaid other postretirement benefit costs from $28 million in 2022 to $74 million in 2023 reflect a potential shift in Southern Company's broader employee benefit liability management strategy, particularly in light of the decrease in total employee benefit obligations from $437 million to $285 million across the same period?",
      "answer": "The significant increase in Alabama Power's prepaid other postretirement benefit costs from $28 million in 2022 to $74 million in 2023 suggests that Southern Company may have taken proactive steps to pre-fund postretirement obligations in this key subsidiary. This increase occurred alongside a broader reduction in Southern Company's total employee benefit obligations, which fell from $437 million in 2022 to $285 million in 2023. The combination of these changes indicates a strategic shift toward strengthening balance sheet positioning with respect to long-term liabilities, potentially to align with regulatory expectations or improve financial flexibility. The data implies that Southern Company may have prioritized prepayment in Alabama Power as part of a larger liability management strategy that contributed to the overall decline in employee benefit obligations at the parent level.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company faced potential financial exposure through Georgia Power due to NEIL policy risks, with a maximum annual assessment of $89 million related to nuclear insurance liabilities. By 2024, Georgia Power was actively managing retiree benefit plans, with amortization periods ranging up to 14 years, indicating a shift in financial obligations focus from nuclear insurance risks to long-term employee benefits. This evolution suggests Southern Company's changing risk profile, where short-term insurance liabilities are giving way to longer-term amortized obligations, affecting capital allocation and financial planning strategies.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nCredit  Losses -NEE's credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based on established standards and credit quality indicators. Credit quality indicators and standards that are closely monitored include credit ratings, certain financial ratios and delinquency trends which are based off the latest available information.  Customers  not  meeting  minimum  standards  provide  various  credit  enhancements  or  secured  payment  terms,  such  as  letters  of credit, the posting of margin cash collateral or use of master netting arrangements.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, NEE recorded approximately $146 million, $94 million and $32 million of bad debt expense, including credit losses, respectively, which are included in O&amp;M expenses in NEE's consolidated statements of income. The amount for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily relates to credit losses at NEER driven by the operational and energy market impacts of severe prolonged winter weather in Texas in February 2021 (February 2021 weather event). The estimate for credit losses related to the impacts of the February 2021 weather event was developed based on NEE's assessment of the ultimate collectability of these receivables. At December 31, 2021, approximately $127 million of allowances are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheet related to the February 2021 weather event.\n\nInventory -  FPL  values  materials,  supplies  and  fuel  inventory  using  a  weighted-average  cost  method.  NEER's  materials,  supplies  and  fuel inventories,  which  include  emissions  allowances  and  renewable  energy  credits,  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  weighted-average  cost  and  net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\nEnergy  Trading -  NEE  provides  full  energy  and  capacity  requirements  services  primarily  to  distribution  utilities,  which  include  load-following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contracts, generation facilities and gas infrastructure assets, as well as to take advantage of projected favorable commodity price movements. Trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for at fair value and realized gains and losses from all trading contracts, including those where physical delivery is required, are recorded net for all periods presented. See Note 3.\n\nStorm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery -  The  storm  and  property  insurance  reserve  funds  (storm  funds)  provide  coverage toward FPL's storm damage costs. Marketable securities held in the storm funds are carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of  dividends,  interest  and  realized  gains  and  losses,  net  of  taxes,  are  reinvested  in  the  funds.  Fund  earnings,  as  well  as  any  changes  in unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding adjustment to the storm and property insurance reserves (storm reserves). The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes. The storm funds are included in special use funds and the storm reserves in noncurrent regulatory liabilities, or in the case of a deficit, in regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, FPL's service area was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms, which resulted in the recording of incremental storm restoration costs. The FPL segment determined that it would not seek recovery of certain of such costs through a storm surcharge from customers and instead recorded such costs as storm restoration costs in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. The FPL segment used available reserve amortization to offset all such storm restoration costs that were expensed.\n\nRestoration costs associated with multiple storms since 2018 that impacted FPL's customers in the former Gulf Power service area are being collected from northwest Florida customers through a storm damage surcharge through late 2024 and are recorded as regulatory assets. As of December 31, 2021, the balance was $242 million, of which $92 million and $150 million are included in current regulatory assets and noncurrent regulatory assets, respectively, on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the balance was $347 million, of which $100 million and $247 million are included in current regulatory assets and noncurrent regulatory assets, respectively, on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets - NEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset's fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.\n\nImpairment  of  Equity  Method  Investments -  NEE  evaluates  its  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  when  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value and the investment may be other-than-temporarily impaired. An impairment loss is required to be recognized if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Investments that are otherthan-temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value and cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value. Impairment losses are recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.",

The FPL segment's net income for 2021 and 2020 was $2,935 million and $2,650 million, respectively, representing an increase of $285 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher earnings from investments in plant in service and other property. Such investments grew the FPL segment's average retail rate base by approximately $3.3 billion in 2021 and reflect, among other things, solar generation additions and ongoing transmission and distribution additions.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, FPL's service area was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms, which resulted in the recording of incremental storm restoration costs. FPL determined that it would not seek recovery of certain of such costs through a storm surcharge from customers and instead recorded such costs as storm restoration costs in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. The FPL segment used available reserve amortization  to  offset  all  such  storm  restoration  costs  that  were  expensed.  See  Note  1  -  Storm  Funds,  Storm  Reserves  and  Storm  Cost Recovery.\n\nThe use of reserve amortization was permitted by the 2016 rate agreement. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement. In order to earn a targeted regulatory ROE, subject to limitations associated with the 2016 rate agreement, reserve amortization was calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&amp;M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortization is reversed so as not to exceed the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of the FPL segment's net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include wholesale and transmission service revenues  and  expenses,  cost  recovery  clause  revenues  and  expenses, AFUDC  -  equity  and  revenue  and  costs  not  recoverable  from  retail customers.  In  2021  and  2020,  the  FPL  segment  recorded  reserve  amortization  of  approximately  $429  million  and  the  reversal  of  reserve amortization of $1 million, respectively. The FPL segment's regulatory ROE for both 2021 and 2020 was approximately 11.60%.\n\nIn December 2021, the FPSC issued a final order approving the 2021 rate agreement which became effective in January 2022 and will remain in effect until at least December 2025, establishes FPL's allowed regulatory ROE at 10.60%, with a range of 9.70% to 11.70%, and allows for retail rate base increases in 2022 and 2023. In December 2021, Floridians Against Increased Rates, Inc. and, as a group in January 2022, Florida Rising, Inc., Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc., and League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida filed notices of appeal challenging the FPSC's final order approving the 2021 rate agreement, which notices of appeal are pending before the Florida Supreme Court. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 for additional information on the 2021 rate agreement.\n\nDuring 2021, operating revenues increased $938 million primarily related to higher fuel cost recovery revenues as discussed in cost recovery clauses below.",

By 2024, this growth had significantly slowed to just 0.3%. This dramatic decline in the rate of growth suggests a substantial weakening or stabilization of industrial customer demand over the two-year period.

      "answer": "The Progress Energy segment maintained a consistent current post-retirement liability of $5 million in both 2023 and 2024. However, Duke Energy's intercompany income tax payable associated with the Progress segment increased from $92 million in 2023 to $94 million in 2024, indicating stable tax allocation to this segment despite consistent liability levels. This suggests that the company maintained its tax funding approach for Progress Energy's post-retirement obligations even as broader corporate tax balances shifted.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 Progress Segment: Duke Energy had $92 million in intercompany income tax payable associated with the Progress segment in 2023",

      "answer": "Southern Company Gas' regulatory amortization expense for postretirement benefits decreased from $64 million in 2022 to $39 million in 2024. This decline reflects a reduction in the unrecognized net loss being amortized over time, as the net loss component fell from $38 million in 2021 to $91 million in 2023 (amortized over subsequent years). The trend indicates that the company's regulatory asset base related to postretirement benefits has stabilized, with lower ongoing amortization charges in 2024 compared to 2022.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's total wholesale electric revenues nearly doubled from $1,518 million in 2022 to $3,120 million in 2023, with Alabama Power's share increasing from $328 million to $883 million. This significant growth in wholesale revenues likely reflects a greater operational scale and exposure for Alabama Power. Correspondingly, Alabama Power's maximum annual assessment under NEIL insurance policies rose to $54 million as of December 31, 2023, indicating increased liability risk tied to nuclear operations. This suggests that the growth in wholesale revenues was accompanied by heightened exposure to nuclear insurance assessments and potential liabilities, which could materially affect Southern Company's and Alabama Power's financial condition.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's consolidated sensitivity to discount rate changes in postretirement benefit liabilities decreased from $53 million in 2022 to $31 million in 2024. During this period, Georgia Power's portion of this obligation increased from $18 million to $11 million, indicating a reduction in overall liability exposure for Southern Company. This change occurred despite Georgia Power maintaining its status as a consolidated subsidiary under Southern Company's power of attorney structure, suggesting an improvement in the consolidated postretirement benefit risk profile.",

      "question": "How did the uncertainties surrounding the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2022 affect Georgia Power's reported revenue from contracts with customers in 2023, and what does this suggest about the financial impact of regulatory challenges on Southern Company's core utility segments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's auditor, Deloitte, highlighted significant uncertainties regarding the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 due to construction delays, regulatory scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission, and potential legal risks. These uncertainties raised concerns about Georgia Power's ability to recover its investment through customer contracts. By 2023, Georgia Power reported $9,702 million in revenue from contracts with customers. This figure must be interpreted in light of the earlier uncertainties, suggesting that despite regulatory challenges, Georgia Power still maintained a substantial revenue base from customer contracts. However, the presence of $1,882 million in 'Other revenue sources' for Georgia Power in 2023 indicates that alternative revenue mechanisms may have been used to offset potential shortfalls in cost recovery through traditional customer contracts. This reflects a strategic adaptation to the evolving regulatory environment surrounding major infrastructure investments like Plant Vogtle.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power had outstanding claims totaling $128 million related to its ownership interest in Plant Hatch due to the U.S. government's failure to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, with damages continuing to accumulate. By 2024, although no new figures were disclosed, Georgia Power's continued legal pursuit through the Court of Federal Claims, as evidenced by its listed status under entities with power of attorney for legal resolutions, indicates unresolved exposure to these liabilities. This shows that while the financial obligation remained significant, the legal strategy persisted without a material financial impact due to regulatory commitments to credit any recoveries back to customers.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Plant Hatch: Discloses $128 million in outstanding claims related to spent nuclear fuel storage liabilities.",

        "Hop 3: Georgia Power \u2190 SO(2024): Georgia Power is listed under entities with unresolved legal matters, indicating ongoing legal action and liability exposure."

      "question": "How did Southern Company's financial exposure to Plant Hatch through Georgia Power change from 2022 to 2024, considering both ownership structure and operational liability?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's Georgia Power segment reported $757 million in assets related to Plant Hatch, reflecting its undivided joint ownership in the plant. By 2024, Georgia Power remained a co-owner of Plant Hatch alongside entities like OPC, MEAG Power, and others, with Georgia Power acting as the operator and being jointly and severally liable for third-party claims. This ongoing operational liability, combined with Georgia Power's continued status as a key segment within Southern Company, suggests that Southern Company's exposure to Plant Hatch remained significant in 2024, albeit now under a more complex multi-party ownership structure that could affect risk distribution and capital allocation decisions.",

      "question": "How did the change in Alabama Power's prior service cost obligations from 2022 to 2024 reflect shifts in Southern Company's pension plan liabilities, and what does this indicate about long-term employee benefit costs for the utility segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power's prior service cost obligations under Southern Company's pension plan were reported at $4 million. By 2024, this figure decreased to $3 million, reflecting a reduction in the segment's share of unfunded pension liabilities. This decline indicates that Southern Company may have made strategic pension contributions or restructured benefit obligations over the two-year period, reducing the long-term employee benefit burden on the Alabama Power segment. The broader regulatory asset table shows that Southern Company's total prior service cost decreased from $13 million in 2023 to $11 million in 2024, aligning with this downward trend.",

      "question": "How did the change in Atlanta Gas Light's capital investment program in 2023 relate to its authorized rate of return in 2022, and what does this indicate about Southern Company's strategic focus on this segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Atlanta Gas Light had an authorized rate of return of 10.25%, which was the highest among Southern Company's gas utilities, signaling a strong regulatory return expectation for this segment. In 2023, Southern Company invested $104 million in Atlanta Gas Light under its System Reinforcement Rider program, with total expenditures since inception reaching $180 million. This level of investment, paired with a relatively short 3-year program duration, suggests that Southern Company is prioritizing infrastructure reinforcement in this segment, likely aiming to support or justify the higher authorized ROE through targeted capital improvements that can be recovered via rider mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Authorized ROE: Southern Company disclosed Atlanta Gas Light's authorized ROE of 10.25% in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Authorized ROE \u2192 Atlanta Gas Light: The 10.25% authorized ROE was specifically tied to the Atlanta Gas Light segment in the 2022 disclosures.",
        "Hop 3: Atlanta Gas Light \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, Southern Company invested $104 million in Atlanta Gas Light under a system reinforcement program, part of a broader capital allocation strategy."

In 2024, Georgia Power disclosed a longest hedge date of 2027 for natural gas procurement, indicating a strategic effort to stabilize energy costs and reduce volatility.

      "question": "How did Southern Company's stake in Plant Scherer through Georgia Power change from 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the evolution of their joint ownership structure?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's subsidiary Georgia Power held an 8.4% ownership stake in Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 and a 75.0% stake in Plant Scherer Unit 3, indicating a fragmented joint ownership structure with other entities like OPC and MEAG Power. By 2024, Georgia Power remained a co-owner of Plant Scherer, but the structure evolved to include new partners such as FP&L and Jacksonville Electric Authority, with Georgia Power acting as the operator on behalf of co-owners. This reflects a shift toward broader collaboration and operational centralization. Additionally, Southern Company's overall governance relationship with Georgia Power remained intact, as evidenced by the 2024 filing showing Georgia Power's continued role under a power of attorney and resolution framework.",

        "Hop 1: [SO](2022) \u2192 [Plant Scherer]: Southern Company, through its subsidiaries, had indirect ownership in Plant Scherer with Georgia Power holding 8.4% (Units 1 and 2) and 75.0% (Unit 3).",

      "question": "How did Georgia Power's liability risk exposure in 2023 influence Southern Company's nuclear PTC generation and acquisition strategy in 2024, particularly in light of the $89 million NEIL policy assessment limit and the $79 million increase in PTC-related tax benefits?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power faced a potential $89 million liability under its NEIL policy, which exposed Southern Company to significant financial risk in the event of a nuclear incident at its plants. By 2024, Southern Company, through Georgia Power, began generating and purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs\u2014specifically for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4\u2014resulting in a $79 million increase in tax benefits tied to these credits. This suggests that Southern Company may have pursued a strategy to offset potential liability risks identified in 2023 with increased PTC generation and acquisition in 2024, leveraging tax benefits to mitigate exposure. The evidence from both years shows a clear temporal evolution where earlier risk exposure likely informed later strategic decisions around nuclear tax credits.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Georgia Power: Georgia Power had a maximum annual NEIL policy assessment liability of $89 million in 2023, which could materially affect Southern Company's financial position.",
        "Hop 2: Georgia Power \u2192 Advanced Nuclear PTCs: Georgia Power began generating and acquiring advanced nuclear PTCs in 2024, with a $79 million increase in PTC-related tax benefits directly tied to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",
        "Hop 3: Advanced Nuclear PTCs \u2190 SO(2024): Southern Company, through Georgia Power, actively purchased and generated PTCs in 2024, indicating a strategic focus on leveraging nuclear-related tax benefits."

The increase was primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings, a $197 million decrease in the flowback of certain excess deferred income taxes at Alabama Power, and a $112 million increase in charges to a valuation allowance on certain state tax credit carryforwards at Georgia Power, partially offset by an increase of $79 million in the generation of advanced nuclear PTCs at Georgia Power and $26 million from the recognition of certain state tax  positions from amended returns at Georgia Power. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Net Loss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n\nSubstantially all noncontrolling interests relate to renewable projects at Southern Power. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests increased $14 million, or 11.0%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increased loss was primarily due to $23 million in higher HLBV loss allocations to Southern Power's tax equity partners, partially offset by $12 million in higher income allocations to Southern Power's equity partners.\n\n## Gas Business\n\nSouthern Company Gas distributes natural gas through utilities in four states and is involved in several other complementary businesses including gas pipeline investments and gas marketing services.\n\nA condensed statement of income for the gas business follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the financial exposure of Georgia Power to Plant Hatch-related liabilities change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about Southern Company's evolving risk profile in its nuclear plant operations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power was disclosed as a co-owner of Plant Hatch, with operational responsibility and financial liability for third-party claims under a jointly and severally liable arrangement. This is evidenced by the $757 million investment in Plant Hatch in 2021 (disclosed in SO 2022 filings). By 2023, Georgia Power's exposure was reflected in a significantly increased potential financial liability under NEIL insurance policies, with a maximum annual assessment rising to $89 million. This indicates that Southern Company's risk profile related to nuclear plant operations, particularly for jointly-owned assets like Plant Hatch, increased from 2022 to 2023, as Georgia Power faced greater potential liability exposure despite no new construction or ownership changes being disclosed.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny over uncertainties in the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including independent monitoring, legal inquiries, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission reviews. This scrutiny likely contributed to a growing regulatory liability burden. By 2023, Southern Company's consolidated Net Regulatory Assets for Georgia Power specifically increased from a liability of $39 million at the end of 2022 to $74 million in liabilities by year-end 2023. This indicates that unresolved cost recovery issues from the Vogtle project continued to accumulate as regulatory liabilities, reflecting ongoing challenges in recovering construction costs through rate mechanisms.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's audit procedures focused heavily on Georgia Power's uncertainties regarding cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with no mention of PTCs being generated. By 2023, Georgia Power began generating advanced nuclear PTCs starting July 31, 2023, and also started purchasing PTCs from other Vogtle owners, which were recognized as income tax benefits. Southern Company had $0.8 billion of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs at year-end 2023, with the new nuclear PTCs contributing to this pool. The Inflation Reduction Act of August 2022 extended and expanded PTCs, allowing for greater flexibility in tax credit utilization through transferability provisions, which Southern Power began exploring in Q4 2023 with an immaterial initial transfer. This marks a shift from 2022's risk-focused approach to 2023's active tax credit generation and monetization strategy.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's treatment of cloud implementation costs through Alabama Power evolve from 2022 to 2024, especially considering the emergence of specific deferred balances and regulatory asset recognition?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's filings did not disclose any specific deferred cloud implementation costs, indicating that such expenses were likely treated as routine operational costs within Alabama Power's broader financial disclosures. By 2024, however, the company began explicitly reporting deferred cloud implementation costs as a distinct regulatory asset, with Alabama Power carrying $92 million of the total $321 million balance at year-end. This shift reflects a change in accounting treatment where cloud-related expenditures became significant enough to warrant separate regulatory deferral, similar to nuclear refueling costs, and were amortized over time rather than expensed immediately. The emergence of these deferred balances in 2024 highlights a material evolution in how Southern Company and its subsidiary Alabama Power accounted for and disclosed strategic technology investments.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy highlighted its exposure to natural gas cost volatility, particularly through Piedmont's natural gas supply contracts, and emphasized the use of financial instruments to hedge these risks and reduce volatility for customers. By 2024, Piedmont disclosed remaining performance obligations totaling $405 million, with specific amounts of $64 million in 2025 and $51 million in 2026, indicating a structured approach to managing future obligations. This suggests that the hedging strategies implemented in response to 2023 volatility were reflected in the multi-year performance obligation disclosures in 2024, showing a strategic evolution in managing commodity risk over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power was recovering financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 through the NCCR tariff, with a $36 million annual increase approved for 2023. By 2024, following the in-service date of Unit 4, Georgia Power transitioned to recovering these costs through retail base rates instead of the NCCR tariff. This included a $730 million annual increase in retail base revenues and a 5% adjustment to average retail base rates. The shift was formalized under the Georgia PSC-approved Prudency Stipulation, which allowed recovery of $7.562 billion in construction and capital costs, with $5.462 billion newly added to the retail rate base in 2024. This reflects a transformation in the cost recovery mechanism from a dedicated tariff to inclusion in general retail base rates.",

Georgia Power currently recovers its costs from the regulated retail business through the 2019 ARP, which includes traditional base tariffs, Demand-Side Management (DSM) tariffs, the ECCR tariff, and Municipal Franchise Fee (MFF) tariffs. In addition, financing costs on certified construction costs of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 are being collected through the NCCR tariff and fuel costs are collected through a fuel cost recovery tariff, both under separate regulatory proceedings.\n\nSee \"Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and Common Facilities Rate Proceeding\" herein for information regarding the approved recovery through retail base rates of certain costs related to Plant V ogtle Unit 3 and the common facilities shared between Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 (Common Facilities) that will become effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. As costs are included in retail base rates, the related financing costs will no longer be recovered through the NCCR tariff. See \"Nuclear Construction\" herein for additional information on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n\n## Rate Plans\n\n## 2019 ARP\n\nIn 2019, the Georgia PSC voted to approve the 2019 ARP, under which Georgia Power increased its rates on January 1, 2020. In December 2020 and on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved tariff adjustments effective January 1, 2021 and 2022, respectively.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nand the State of Georgia enacted the Georgia Nuclear Energy Financing Act, which allowed Georgia Power to recover financing costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Financing costs were recovered on all applicable certified costs through annual adjustments to the NCCR tariff up to the certified capital cost of $4.418 billion. Financing costs related to capital costs above $4.418 billion up to $7.562 billion approved for recovery as described below were recognized through AFUDC and are being recovered through retail rates over the life of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4; however, G eorgia Power did not record AFUDC related to any capital costs in excess of $7.562 billion. In 2022, the G eorgia PSC approved Georgia Power's filing to increase the NCCR tariff by $36 million annually, effective January 1, 2023. In November 2023, Georgia Power filed a request to continue for 2024 the NCCR tariff that was effective during 2023. The staff of the Georgia PSC accepted the proposal and no further approval from the Georgia PSC was required. See additional information below on AFUDC and the NCCR tariff following commercial operation of Unit 4.\n\nIn 2021, the Georgia PSC approved an order under which Georgia Power would include in rate base an allocation of $2.1 billion to Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and the Common Facilities from the $3.6 billion of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 costs previously deemed prudent by the Georgia PSC and would recover the related depreciation through retail base rates effective the month after Unit 3 is placed in service. In compliance with the G eorgia PSC order, G eorgia Power increased annual retail base rates by $318 million effective August 1, 2023 based on the in-service date of July 31, 2023 for Unit 3. The related increase in annual retail base rates included recovery of all projected operations and maintenance expenses for Unit 3 and the Common Facilities and other related costs of operation, partially offset by the related PTCs. Financing costs (debt and equity) on the remaining portion of the total Unit 3 and the Common Facilities construction costs continued to be recovered through the NCCR tariff or deferred. Georgia Power deferred as a regulatory asset the debt component of financing costs as well as the remaining depreciation until Unit 4 costs were placed in retail base rates as described below. The regulatory assets for the debt component of financing costs and depreciation are being recovered over 10 years beginning May 2024, as approved by the Georgia PSC, with a remaining balance of $23 million and $29 million, respectively, at December 31, 2024. The equity component of financing costs ($39 million at December 31, 2024) represents an unrecognized ratemaking amount that is not reflected on Georgia Power's balance sheets. This amount will be recognized in Georgia Power's income statements in the periods it is billable to customers.\n\nIn December 2023, the Georgia PSC approved Georgia Power's application to adjust rates to include reasonable and prudent Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 costs as modified by the related stipulation (Prudency Stipulation) among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors.\n\nUnder the terms of the approved Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power will recover $7.562 billion in total construction and capital costs and associated retail rate base items of $1.02 billion, which includes AFUDC financing costs above $4.418 billion (the Georgia PSC-certified amount) up to $7.562 billion. Georgia Power will also recover projected operations and maintenance expenses, depreciation, nuclear decommissioning accruals, and property taxes, net of projected PTCs. After considering construction and capital costs already in retail base rates of $2.1 billion and $362 million of associated retail rate base items for Unit 3 and Common Facilities (approved by the Georgia PSC in 2021), Georgia Power included in retail rate base the remaining $5.462 billion of construction and capital costs as well as $647 million of associated retail rate base items effective with the April 29, 2024 in-service date for Unit 4. Annual retail base revenues increased approx imately $730 million and the average retail base rates were adjusted by approximately 5% (net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff described below) effective May 1, 2024.\n\nReductions to the ROE used to calculate the NCCR tariff (pursuant to prior Georgia PSC orders) negatively impacted earnings by approximately $80 million through the second quarter 2024 and $310 million and $300 million in 2023 and 2022, respectively. Further, as included in the approved Prudency Stipulation, since commercial operation for Unit 4 was not achieved by March 31, 2024, Georgia Power's ROE used to determine the NCCR tariff and calculate AFUDC was reduced to zero effective April 1, 2024, which resulted in a negative impact to earnings of approximately $10 million (for one month) in the second quarter 2024 based on the April 29, 2024 inservice date. Effective May 1, 2024, following commercial operation of Unit 4, Georgia Power's NCCR tariff was eliminated and financing costs are included in Georgia Power's general retail revenue requirements. Financing costs of $10 million that were not recovered through the NCCR tariff will be addressed in Georgia Power's next retail base rate case proceeding.\n\nAs of each Unit's respective first refueling outage, if the respective Unit's performance has materially deviated from ex pected performance, the Georgia PSC may order Georgia Power to credit customers for operations and maintenance expenses or disallow costs associated with the repair or replacement of any system, structure, or component found to have caused the material deviation in performance if proven to be the result of imprudent engineering, construction, procurement, testing, or start-up. Unit 3 demonstrated high performance and reliability during the first 14 months of operation leading up to its first refueling outage, which took place in the fall of 2024 and no performance-related disallowance is expected. Unit 4 has also demonstrated high performance and reliability since being placed in service and its first refueling outage is projected to begin in the fall of 2025. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy Carolinas' role in Duke Energy's overall reserves for environmental remediation change between 2023 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the regional allocation of environmental liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Carolinas accounted for $23 million of Duke Energy's total $88 million in environmental remediation reserves. By 2024, Duke Energy Carolinas' share increased slightly to $24 million, while the company's total reserves decreased to $73 million. This indicates that although the overall environmental liability decreased, the Carolinas region's proportionate share of those liabilities increased, suggesting a relative concentration of environmental remediation responsibility in that segment. The connection between Duke Energy Carolinas and environmental remediation reserves is disclosed in the segmented liability reporting, which shows how specific regions are allocated portions of the company's total environmental obligations.",

This scrutiny involved detailed audits and inquiries into financial disclosures and risk assessments. By 2023, Georgia Power allocated $0.7 billion to generation maintenance, a key component of its $5.4 billion total capital expenditure.

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant cost recovery risks related to Plant Vogtle Unit 3, as highlighted by external monitors, regulatory scrutiny, and potential legal issues that could impact the recovery of construction costs. By 2023, Georgia Power began generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Unit 3 starting July 31, 2023, and was also purchasing PTCs from other Vogtle owners, signaling a shift from risk exposure to active financial benefit. Additionally, Georgia Power reported $452 million in net state investment and tax credit carryforwards, with a $60 million valuation allowance, indicating ongoing challenges in full utilization despite the new revenue streams from the plant.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power and Alabama Power equally owned SEGCO, which operated generating units at Plant Gaston and had associated transmission facilities. Both companies made payments to SEGCO to cover operating expenses, taxes, interest, and a return on equity, with Georgia Power reporting $115 million in 2023 and Alabama Power reporting $112 million in purchased power expenses from SEGCO. This joint financial commitment indicates shared exposure to SEGCO\u2019s operational and market risks. By 2024, Alabama Power disclosed $23 million in derivative liabilities designated for regulatory purposes and $100 million in total derivative liabilities, suggesting increased exposure to market risks\u2014likely influenced by ongoing shared obligations through SEGCO. This evolution shows how Southern Company\u2019s structure channeled financial risk through its subsidiaries across years.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power amortized nuclear refueling costs over 18 months for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 and 24 months for Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2, starting the amortization period the month the refueling outage begins. This amortization practice was explicitly stated in the 2022 10-K and was subject to ongoing scrutiny by the Georgia Public Service Commission and Deloitte's audit procedures, which focused on disclosures around uncertainties in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cost recovery. In 2023, the same amortization periods (18 months for Vogtle Units 1/2, 24 months for Hatch Units 1/2) were maintained, and the deferral of nuclear refueling costs to regulatory assets continued unchanged. This consistency in accounting treatment, despite the heightened regulatory scrutiny in 2022, indicates that SO and Georgia Power maintained their financial reporting practices related to nuclear refueling without modification in the following year.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's (SO) natural gas distribution segment's contribution to total other natural gas revenues change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about their gas marketing services performance over this period?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas contributed $687 million to total other natural gas revenues, which included $636 million from gas marketing services. By 2024, this contribution decreased to $559 million, with $528 million attributed to gas marketing services. This represents a decline of $108 million in total other natural gas revenues and a $108 million drop in gas marketing services specifically, indicating a contraction in the company's gas marketing activities or a strategic shift in their natural gas segment between 2023 and 2024.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to variable interest rates in 2022 flow through to the specific risk profile of Georgia Power in 2024, and what does this evolution indicate about the company's financial risk management strategy across the two years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed a total long-term variable interest rate exposure of $4,464 million, with Georgia Power specifically exposed to $797 million at a weighted average rate of 0.21%. By 2024, Georgia Power's exposure had significantly increased to $1,636 million with a weighted average interest rate of 4.16%, compared to Southern Company's total exposure of $4,727 million. This indicates a strategic shift where Georgia Power assumed a larger proportion of the company's variable interest rate risk. The increase in both the absolute exposure and the interest rate environment suggests that Southern Company may have reallocated debt to Georgia Power, potentially reflecting broader capital structure decisions or investment initiatives within that segment. This evolution in exposure highlights a material change in financial risk management strategy, with Georgia Power bearing a heavier burden of interest rate volatility in 2024 compared to earlier years.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.\n\nGiven the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)\n\nThe consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.\n\nSouthern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.\n\nCurrent and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.\n\nGiven the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)\n\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.\n\nThe ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property",

      "question": "How did Southern Company Gas' contribution to total reclassification adjustments change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the evolution of its pension amortization strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas contributed $10 million to total reclassification adjustments, primarily through the amortization of regulatory assets. By 2024, this contribution shifted to a $4 million reduction in adjustments, indicating a deliberate recalibration in how pension-related gains and prior service costs were amortized. This change reveals a strategic pivot in Southern Company Gas' pension amortization approach, moving from a model that emphasized regulatory asset amortization to one that more selectively recognized net gains and service cost reductions. Specifically, the amortization of net gain increased from $0 in 2023 to $5 million in 2024 for Southern Company Gas, while amortization of regulatory assets remained consistent at $9 million in both years. This suggests a more nuanced approach to managing pension-related financial impacts.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Southern Company Gas: Southern Company Gas contributed $10 million to total reclassification adjustments in 2023 through amortization of regulatory assets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's subsidiary Georgia Power faced potential additional pre-tax charges of up to $460 million related to cost-sharing provisions at Plant Vogtle, stemming from construction overruns and disagreements with other stakeholders. By 2023, Georgia Power remained exposed to additional financial obligations, including a maximum annual retrospective insurance assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies. This shows that while the form of financial risk shifted from construction cost overruns to insurance liabilities, Southern Company's exposure through Georgia Power remained significant year-over-year.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements\n\nIn connection with a September 2018 vote by the Vogtle Owners to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other V ogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners at pre-established prices, and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG Power and MEAG SPVJ to provide up to $300 million of funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. In January 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).\n\nPursuant to the Global Amendments: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain adverse events occur, including, among other events: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public announcement of its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more from the seventeenth VCM report estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. The latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition, if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See Note 8 under \"Long-term Debt - DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings\" for additional information.\n\nGeorgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact the calculation. Based on the definition in the Global Amendments, Georgia Power believes the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and the current project capital cost forecast has triggered the cost-sharing provisions. The other V ogtle Owners have asserted that the project cost increases have reached the cost-sharing thresholds and have triggered the tender provisions under the Global Amendments. Georgia Power recorded an additional pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) associated with these cost-sharing and tender provisions, which is included in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $460 million associated with these provisions based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental charges associated with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. On October 29, 2021, Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners entered into an agreement to clarify the process for the tender provisions of the Global Amendments to provide for a decision between 120 and 180 days after the tender option is triggered, which the other Vogtle Owners assert occurred on February 14, 2022.",

      "answer": "The reduction in Atlanta Gas Light's unrecognized equity return from $47 million in 2022 to $11 million in 2024 indicates that the recovery mechanism under the GRAM regulatory framework has been effective in recognizing returns on past infrastructure investments. This decline shows that a significant portion of the previously uncollected equity return on capital investments\u2014specifically $36 million\u2014has been recovered through annual base rate adjustments as part of GRAM. The Georgia PSC\u2019s annual review process under GRAM ensured that these returns were systematically recognized and recovered, with the remaining $11 million expected to be fully recovered by December 31, 2025. This demonstrates the framework\u2019s success in aligning investment timelines, return recognition, and rate recovery mechanisms.",

        "Hop 3: Unrecognized Equity Return \u2190 SO(2024): By 2024, the unrecognized equity return had declined to $11 million, indicating successful recovery of prior infrastructure investment returns under GRAM, with the remaining balance expected to be fully recovered by 2025."

In 2014, the Illinois Commission approved the nine-year regulatory infrastructure program, Investing in Illinois, subject to annual review. In accordance with orders from the Illinois Commission, Nicor Gas recovers program costs incurred through a separate rider and base rates. The Illinois Commission's approval of Nicor Gas' rate case on November 18, 2021 included recovery of program costs through December 31, 2021.

      "question": "What does Georgia Power's 2024 14-year amortization period for retiree benefit plans suggest about its long-term regulatory cost recovery strategies, given the uncertainties around Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cost recovery identified in 2022?",
      "answer": "Georgia Power's 2024 disclosure of a 14-year amortization period for retiree benefit plans suggests a consistent regulatory accounting strategy aimed at long-term cost recovery, even amid uncertainties such as those identified in 2022 around Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2022, auditors highlighted significant scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission and potential risks to cost recovery for Plant Vogtle, including legal, regulatory, and construction uncertainties. The 2024 evidence shows that Georgia Power continues to apply extended amortization periods (up to 14 years for retiree benefit plans), aligning with its broader approach to spreading large capital investments and obligations across rate bases over time. This indicates that despite the Plant Vogtle cost recovery challenges, Georgia Power remains committed to a long-term regulatory framework that prioritizes stable cost recovery mechanisms approved by its regulators.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power reported $8 million in amortization of deferred cloud implementation costs, which increased to $11 million in 2023. This rise reflects Southern Company's ongoing investment in cloud computing infrastructure across its operating segments, including Alabama Power. The amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis over the hosting arrangement term, and the increase suggests that more cloud implementation projects reached service readiness during the period. This trend aligns with the company's broader strategy to modernize IT systems and defer associated costs for regulatory treatment, indicating a deliberate shift toward scalable cloud-based solutions that affect operations and maintenance expenses.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company Gas disclosed a $222 million gas supply commitment tied to floating natural gas prices, based on forward prices at the time, indicating significant exposure to market price fluctuations. By 2024, Southern Company Gas had evolved its risk management strategy, as evidenced by its use of netting agreements, collateral requirements, and internal credit ratings for counterparties. Specifically, $17 million in cash collateral was held in broker margin accounts at year-end 2024, showing a more structured and proactive approach to mitigating counterparty and market risk. This evolution suggests a shift from passive exposure to active financial risk mitigation in gas supply procurement.",

See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" for information on Southern Company Gas' commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply. Total estimated costs for fuel and purchased power commitments at December 31, 2021 for the applicable Registrants are provided in the table below. Fuel costs include purchases of coal (for the traditional electric operating companies) and natural gas (for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power), as well as the related transportation and storage. In most cases, these contracts contain provisions for price escalation, minimum purchase levels, and other financial commitments. Natural gas purchase commitments are based on various indices at the time of delivery; the amounts reflected below have been estimated based on the NYMEX future prices at December 31, 2021. As discussed under \"Capital Expenditures\" herein, estimated expenditures for nuclear fuel are included in the applicable Registrants' construction programs for the years 2022 through 2026. Nuclear fuel commitments at December 31, 2021 that extend beyond 2026 are included in the table below. Purchased power costs represent estimated minimum obligations for various PPAs for the purchase of capacity and energy, except for those accounted for as leases, which are discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements.\n\n",

The majority of the Registrants' fuel expense for the periods presented was purchased under long-term commitments. Each Registrant expects that a substantial amount of its future fuel needs will continue to be purchased under long-term commitments.\n\nGeorgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required whether or not any capacity is available. Portions of the capacity payments made to MEAG Power for its Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 investment relate to costs in excess of Georgia Power's allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these portions at the time of the disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity is included in purchased power in Southern Company's statements of income and in purchased power, non-affiliates in Georgia Power's statements of income. Georgia Power's capacity payments related to this commitment totaled $6 million, $5 million, and $6 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, Georgia Power's estimated long-term obligations related to this commitment totaled $42 million, consisting of $4 million for 2022, $3 million annually for 2023 through 2025, $1 million for 2026, and $28 million thereafter.\n\nSee Note 9 for information regarding PPAs accounted for as leases.\n\nSouthern Company Gas has commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply, including charges recoverable through natural gas cost recovery mechanisms or, alternatively, billed to marketers selling retail natural gas. Gas supply commitments include amounts for gas commodity purchases associated with Nicor Gas and SouthStar of 56 million mmBtu at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2021 and valued at $222 million. Southern Company Gas provides guarantees to certain gas suppliers for certain of its subsidiaries in support of payment obligations. Southern Company Gas' expected future contractual obligations for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply that are not recognized on the balance sheets at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $17 million.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&amp;P, or Fitch or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit ex posure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their ex posure to counterparty credit risk.\n\nSouthern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investmentgrade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against",

      "answer": "Piedmont's remaining performance obligations declined from $592 million in 2022 to $61 million in 2024. During the same period, the accumulated amortization - other for the Piedmont segment increased from $6 million in 2023 to $9 million in 2024. This indicates that while the segment's contractual obligations were being fulfilled and declining over time, the amortization of intangible assets associated with those obligations increased. The evidence reveals that the segment experienced both a reduction in future revenue commitments and an increase in the amortization of other intangible assets, suggesting a shift in the nature or composition of these assets over time.",

This growing liability burden coincided with Alabama Power's $54 million maximum annual assessment exposure under NEIL nuclear insurance policies as of December 31, 2023.

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant uncertainties regarding the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, which were monitored by the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), creating risks around cost recovery and financial disclosures. By 2023, these uncertainties appeared to have diminished, as evidenced by Georgia Power's ability to provide specific tax planning details: its ITC/PTC carryforwards of $12 million were scheduled to begin expiring in 2032 and were expected to be utilized by 2028. This level of specificity in the 2023 disclosures suggests that the resolution of construction-related regulatory uncertainties in 2022 enabled more confident long-term financial and tax planning.",

This shift correlates with Alabama Power reporting $100 million in derivative liabilities in 2024, entirely tied to regulatory and cash flow hedging instruments.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company Gas reported $58 million in net regulatory liabilities. By 2024, this figure increased to $84 million, reflecting a $26 million deterioration over the two-year period. This was driven by the amortization of regulatory assets specific to Southern Company Gas, which saw a $10 million reduction in 2023 and a further $9 million reduction in 2024. These reductions indicate that the company faced increasing challenges in recovering certain regulatory costs, contributing to the growing net regulatory liability position by the end of 2024.",

      "answer": "Southern Company reduced its annual salary increase assumption from 4.73% in 2022 to 4.60% in 2024 across all segments including Southern Power. This adjustment was consistently applied in pension plan valuations, as shown in the 2024 disclosures where the Southern Power segment used the updated 4.60% figure. The change reflects a deliberate recalibration of long-term workforce cost projections, aligning assumptions more closely with current economic conditions while maintaining consistency in financial reporting methodology.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Annual Salary Increase: Southern Company disclosed a 4.73% annual salary increase assumption for pension plan calculations in 2022, applied consistently across all segments including Southern Power.",
        "Hop 2: Annual Salary Increase \u2192 Southern Power Segment: The 2024 disclosures show Southern Power segment explicitly using the updated 4.60% annual salary increase assumption in its pension plan valuations, demonstrating a direct connection between the financial assumption and segment reporting.",
        "Hop 3: Southern Power Segment \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, Southern Company-wide adjustments to assumptions, including the 4.60% salary increase, were consistently reflected in the Southern Power segment's financial disclosures, showing how corporate-level assumptions translate to segment reporting."

      "question": "How did the increase in Georgia Power's deferred cloud implementation costs from $81 million in 2021 to $108 million in 2022 relate to Southern Company's regulatory scrutiny of Plant Vogtle Unit construction uncertainties during the same period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company faced heightened regulatory scrutiny over Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including independent monitoring, legal inquiries, and NRC oversight, which raised uncertainties around cost recovery (Hop 1). During this time, Georgia Power's deferred cloud implementation costs rose from $81 million in 2021 to $108 million in 2022 (Hop 2 & 3), suggesting that ongoing digital infrastructure investments were being capitalized despite regulatory and construction-related financial risks. This indicates that while Georgia Power was under pressure regarding cost transparency on its nuclear buildout, it continued to defer significant cloud implementation costs, potentially signaling strategic prioritization of IT modernization amid broader capital challenges.",

      "question": "How did the significant increase in Southern Company's total natural gas distribution revenues from 2022 ($5.2 billion) to 2023 relate to Alabama Power's exposure to potential insurance assessments under the NEIL policies, which could reach up to $54 million annually as of December 31, 2023?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's total natural gas distribution revenues increased from $2.989 billion in 2022 to $5.218 billion in 2023, nearly doubling. This growth in gas operations, which are reported under Southern Company Gas, occurred alongside Alabama Power's continued exposure to potential insurance assessments under the NEIL policies, with a maximum annual assessment of $54 million as of December 31, 2023. While the gas business grew significantly, Alabama Power remained subject to these insurance risk exposures, which could impact its financial position and, by extension, Southern Company's consolidated results. The increased gas revenues did not appear to directly mitigate or alter Alabama Power's exposure to these potential assessments.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Total natural gas distribution revenues: Southern Company reported $2.989 billion in natural gas distribution revenues in 2022",

        "Hop 3: Alabama Power \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, Alabama Power had potential insurance assessments under NEIL policies up to $54 million annually, which could be impacted by the company's overall risk profile that includes growth in other business segments"

      "question": "How did Southern Company's legal exposure related to spent nuclear fuel storage at Plant Hatch evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about the progression of Georgia Power's claims against the U.S. government?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (through Georgia Power) faced legal and financial uncertainties tied to the U.S. government's failure to fulfill its contractual obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, with inquiries and audits focused on cost recovery and disclosures related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. By 2023, Georgia Power had filed multiple rounds of lawsuits against the U.S. government, with claims for damages related to Plant Hatch (among other plants) totaling $128 million for the period from January 1, 2011, through December 31, 2019. These damages continued to accumulate, and on-site dry spent fuel storage facilities were expanded to accommodate spent fuel through the plant\u2019s expected life. This indicates a shift from uncertainty and disclosure risk in 2022 to active legal pursuit and quantified financial exposure in 2023, with Georgia Power taking a more assertive stance in seeking compensation for ongoing storage costs at Plant Hatch.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Georgia Power: Southern Company's 2022 audit highlighted inquiries into Georgia Power\u2019s disclosures regarding uncertainties in cost recovery for Plant Vogtle construction, including legal risks tied to spent fuel storage.",
        "Hop 2: Georgia Power \u2192 Plant Hatch: Georgia Power has a stake in Plant Hatch and is actively involved in legal claims against the U.S. government for damages related to the storage of spent nuclear fuel at the plant.",
        "Hop 3: Plant Hatch \u2190 SO(2023): Southern Company\u2019s 2023 disclosures include Plant Hatch in the list of nuclear facilities with decommissioning obligations and note that spent fuel storage costs continue to accumulate, with no financial recognition yet of potential recoveries."

      "answer": "In 2022, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate resulted in a $18/$(17) million change in Georgia Power's Projected Obligation for Other Postretirement Benefit Plans. By 2024, this sensitivity had decreased to $11/$(10) million. This reduction in sensitivity indicates that Georgia Power's postretirement benefit obligations became less volatile with respect to discount rate fluctuations, suggesting a potential de-risking of the obligation profile or a reduction in the duration of liabilities. The change reflects a more stable financial risk position for Georgia Power with respect to these benefit plans.",

      "question": "What drove the shift in SO's retail electricity sales from growth in 2022 to decline in 2023, and how did this affect residential versus commercial segments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SO reported a total retail KWHs growth of 2.0%, driven by increases in Commercial (2.7%) and Industrial (3.7%) segments, while Residential remained flat (0.2%). This growth was underpinned by a 1.1% increase in total retail KWHs in the earlier reported data. However, by 2023, the trend reversed, with total retail KWHs declining by 2.1%, primarily due to a sharp drop in Residential sales (-5.0%) and a stagnation in Commercial sales (0.1%), despite Industrial sales remaining relatively stable (-1.6%). The shift from growth to decline suggests a significant change in demand patterns, particularly in the Residential segment, which may have been influenced by external factors such as weather or economic conditions, though no explicit causal link is provided in the filings.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Georgia Power's under-recovered fuel balance from 2022 to 2023 impact its financial obligations and regulatory liabilities, particularly in relation to deferred fuel clause revenues?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power's under-recovered fuel balance totaled $2.1 billion, which was included in deferred under-recovered retail fuel clause revenues on both Southern Company's and Georgia Power's balance sheets. By 2023, this balance increased to $1.9 billion, with $694 million included in under-recovered fuel clause revenues and $1.2 billion in deferred under-recovered retail fuel clause revenues. This growing imbalance placed upward pressure on Georgia Power's regulatory liabilities, as the company was required to defer larger portions of unrecovered fuel costs. The Georgia PSC approved a 54% increase in annual fuel billings (approximately $1.1 billion) in May 2023 to address the $2.2 billion under-recovered balance as of May 31, 2023, indicating that the growing under-recovery directly influenced rate adjustments and increased financial obligations through deferred revenue mechanisms.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nIn addition, the 2022 IRP includes requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Capital, operations and maintenance, and CCR ARO costs associated with ash pond and landfill closures and post-closure care. The recovery of these costs is expected to be determined in future base rate cases;\n- Installation of environmental controls at Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4 (1,760 MWs) and Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership) for compliance with ELG rules;\n- Investments related to the hydro operations of Plants Sinclair (45 MWs), North Highlands (30 MWs), and Burton (6 MWs);\n- Establishment of a request for proposals (RFP) process for 2,300 MWs of renewable resources by 2029. Georgia Power expects to request an additional 3,700 MWs by 2035 through future IRP proceedings;\n- Procurement of 1,000 MWs of Georgia Power-owned storage resources by 2030, including the development of a 265-MW battery energy storage facility beginning in 2026;\n- Related transmission costs necessary to support the proposed retirements and renewable resources previously described;\n- Certification of six PPAs (including five affiliate PPAs with Southern Power that are also subject to approval by the FERC) with capacities of 1,567 MWs beginning in 2024, 380 MWs beginning in 2025, and 228 MWs beginning in 2028, procured through RFPs approved through the 2019 IRP; and\n- Certification of approximately 88 MWs of wholesale capacity to be placed in retail rate base between January 1, 2024 and January 1, 2025.\n\nA decision from the Georgia PSC on the 2022 IRP is expected in July 2022. The ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs\n\nIn April 2020 and June 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Georgia Power to continue its previous, voluntary suspension of customer disconnections through July 14, 2020 and to defer the resulting incremental bad debt as a regulatory asset. In June 2020 and July 2020, the Georgia PSC approved orders establishing a methodology for identifying incremental bad debt and allowing the deferral of other incremental costs associated with the COVID19 pandemic. At December 31, 2020, the incremental costs deferred totaled approximately $38 million (including approximately $23 million of incremental bad debt costs and $15 million of other incremental costs). Since June 2021, Georgia Power has continued a review of bad debt amounts deferred under the Georgia PSC-approved methodology, including consideration of actual amounts repaid by customers from arrears and installment plans after the disconnection moratorium period ended. As a result, Georgia Power's incremental costs deferred at December 31, 2021 totaled approximately $21 million, including an immaterial amount of incremental bad debt costs. The period over which these costs will be recovered is expected to be determined in Georgia Power's next base rate case. The ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## Fuel Cost Recovery\n\nGeorgia Power has established fuel cost recovery rates approved by the Georgia PSC. In May 2020, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation agreement among Georgia Power, the staff of the Georgia PSC, and certain intervenors to lower total fuel billings by approximately $740 million over a two-year period effective June 1, 2020. In addition, Georgia Power further lowered fuel billings by approximately $44 million under an interim fuel rider effective June 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020. During the second half of 2021, the price of natural gas rose significantly and resulted in an under recovered fuel balance exceeding $200 million. Therefore, on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC voted to approve Georgia Power's interim fuel rider, which increased fuel rates by 15%, or approximately $252 million annually, effective January 1, 2022. Georgia Power continues to be allowed to adjust its fuel cost recovery rates under an interim fuel rider prior to the next fuel case if the over recovered fuel balance exceeds $200 million. Georgia Power is scheduled to file its next fuel case no later than February 28, 2023.\n\nGeorgia Power's under recovered fuel balance totaled $410 million at December 31, 2021 and is included in other deferred charges and assets on Southern Company's balance sheet and deferred under recovered fuel clause revenues on Georgia Power's balance sheet. At December 31, 2020, Georgia Power's over recovered fuel balance totaled $113 million and is included in other current liabilities on Southern Company's balance sheet and over recovered fuel clause revenues on Georgia Power's balance sheet.\n\nGeorgia Power's fuel cost recovery mechanism includes costs associated with a natural gas hedging program, as revised and approved by the Georgia PSC, allowing the use of an array of derivative instruments within a 36-month time horizon.\n\nFuel cost recovery revenues as recorded on the financial statements are adjusted for differences in actual recoverable fuel costs and amounts billed in current regulated rates. Accordingly, changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Georgia Power's revenues or net income but will affect operating cash flows.",

      "question": "How did the financial risk profile of Georgia Power, as indicated by its maximum short-term debt outstanding in Q4, evolve from 2022 to 2023, and what does this suggest about Southern Company's broader capital management strategy during the ongoing construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power reported a maximum short-term debt outstanding of $1,710 million in Q4, which increased to $2,260 million in 2023 \u2014 a rise of $550 million. This increase occurred alongside ongoing construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, a project that, as of 2022, was under scrutiny for cost recovery uncertainties and regulatory challenges. The significant rise in short-term debt suggests that Southern Company may have relied more heavily on short-term financing in 2023 to fund the continued development of the Vogtle project, despite earlier concerns raised by auditors about financial disclosures and cost recovery risks. This shift reflects a strategic decision to maintain project momentum, even as it introduced greater near-term financial exposure.",

      "question": "How did changes in Duke Energy Florida's segment contribution between 2023 and 2024 impact the company's noncurrent post-retirement liability, and what does this indicate about the segment's evolving pension funding responsibility?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy Florida's segment contribution to the noncurrent post-retirement liability decreased from $59 million in 2023 to $58 million in 2024, reflecting a $1 million reduction in its long-term pension obligation. This slight decline suggests a minor shift in the segment's pension funding responsibility, even as the overall noncurrent liability for Duke Energy decreased from $179 million to $165 million company-wide. The change indicates a relatively stable but slightly reduced burden on the Florida segment in supporting long-term retirement benefits compared to the prior year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 Florida Segment: In 2023, Duke Energy Florida contributed $59 million to the company's noncurrent post-retirement liability.",
        "Hop 2: Florida Segment \u2192 Noncurrent Post-Retirement Liability: The Florida segment's contribution is a component of the total noncurrent post-retirement liability disclosed in the consolidated financial statements.",
        "Hop 3: Noncurrent Post-Retirement Liability \u2190 DUK(2024): By 2024, the Florida segment's contribution to the liability decreased slightly to $58 million, part of a broader decline in the company-wide liability from $179 million to $165 million."

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2022 deferred asset position tied to Alabama Power's regulatory hedging activities relate to the 2023 increase in maximum annual nuclear insurance assessments, and what does this indicate about their evolving risk management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company reported $25 million in Other Deferred Charges and Assets for Alabama Power related to energy-related derivatives designated as hedging instruments for regulatory purposes. This reflects deferred cost recovery mechanisms tied to nuclear operations. In 2023, Alabama Power's maximum annual assessment under NEIL nuclear liability policies increased to $54 million, indicating heightened potential exposure. The connection shows Southern Company's evolving risk management strategy balancing deferred regulatory cost recovery with increased nuclear liability exposure, maintaining both financial instruments for cost recovery while facing higher potential assessments for nuclear risk coverage.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company Gas' regulatory amortization of $64 million in 2022 transition to a regulatory amortization of -$4 million in 2023, and what does this shift indicate about the change in their regulatory asset treatment over this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company Gas reported a regulatory amortization of $64 million, reflecting the gradual write-off of regulatory assets over time as disclosed in SO's 2022 10-K filing. By 2023, this figure had shifted to -$4 million, indicating a reversal or reclassification in the treatment of regulatory assets. This significant change from a positive amortization amount to a negative one suggests a fundamental shift in how regulatory assets were being recognized or amortized, potentially due to updated regulatory agreements, revised recovery periods, or changes in accounting treatment. The transition from $64 million in 2022 to -$4 million in 2023 highlights a dynamic evolution in the relationship between Southern Company Gas and its regulatory amortization obligations.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 'Other regulatory liabilities, deferred' for Georgia Power change between 2023 and 2024, and what might this indicate about Georgia Power's regulatory obligations under Southern Company's ownership structure?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's 'Other regulatory liabilities, deferred' for Georgia Power decreased from $85 million in 2023 to $67 million in 2024, reflecting a reduction of $18 million. This decline indicates a potential easing of regulatory obligations for Georgia Power during this period. Given that Southern Company maintains a controlling stake in Georgia Power, as evidenced by the Power of Attorney and resolution documentation in SO's 2024 10-K filing, this reduction in liabilities could suggest improved regulatory positioning or strategic adjustments in how Georgia Power is managing its obligations under Southern Company's ownership structure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Other regulatory liabilities, deferred: Southern Company reported $85 million in deferred regulatory liabilities for Georgia Power in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Other regulatory liabilities, deferred \u2192 Georgia Power: The liability is specifically attributed to Georgia Power in both 2023 and 2024 filings, showing a direct financial relationship.",
        "Hop 3: Georgia Power \u2190 SO(2024): Southern Company maintains a controlling stake in Georgia Power, as documented through Power of Attorney and resolution in the 2024 filing."

      "question": "How did the impact of Southern Company Gas on the Projected Obligation for Other Postretirement Benefit Plans change from 2022 to 2024, given the $6 million increase in 2022 and the $3 million decrease in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company Gas had a $6 million increase in the Projected Obligation for Other Postretirement Benefit Plans due to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate, indicating a sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations. By 2024, this relationship reversed, with the same 25 basis point change leading to a $3 million decrease in the obligation. This shift suggests a change in the underlying assumptions or plan structure that reduced the segment's exposure to discount rate volatility over the two-year period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company and Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny and financial risk exposure related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including potential challenges to cost recovery and delays that required extensive audit procedures and disclosures. This experience appears to have shaped Georgia Power\u2019s more cautious and strategically phased approach to capital investments in 2024, particularly at Plant Scherer. In 2024, Georgia Power requested an extension of Plant Scherer Unit 3\u2019s operation through at least 2035 and proposed environmental upgrades rather than new builds, while also allocating $760 million in combined capital costs for battery storage and combustion turbines with certified cost caps to limit exposure. This reflects a shift toward cost-controlled, incremental capacity improvements and life extensions of existing assets, likely influenced by the earlier risks seen at Vogtle.",

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

      "question": "How did the change in non-fuel operations and maintenance expense reimbursements from Alabama Power to Mississippi Power for Plant Greene County between 2023 and 2024 reflect shifts in operational cost-sharing dynamics, and what might this indicate about the evolving financial relationship between the two entities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Mississippi Power reimbursed Alabama Power $10 million for its proportionate share of non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses for Plant Greene County, while in 2024, this amount decreased to $7 million. This reduction indicates a shift in the operational cost-sharing dynamics between the two entities. Given that Alabama Power operates Plant Greene County under a joint ownership agreement, the decline in reimbursement could suggest either a reduction in overall operating expenses or a renegotiation of cost-sharing terms. This change in financial relationship may reflect improved cost efficiency or strategic realignment in how the two entities manage shared infrastructure.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Alabama Power: Alabama Power had a financial obligation to operate Plant Greene County and received reimbursements from Mississippi Power for its share of non-fuel O&M expenses, totaling $10 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Alabama Power \u2192 Plant Greene County: Alabama Power operates Plant Greene County under a joint ownership agreement with Mississippi Power, which dictates cost-sharing and reimbursement mechanisms.",

Natural gas purchases made under these agreements were immaterial for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Power for all periods presented.\n\nAlabama Power and Mississippi Power jointly own Plant Greene County. The companies have an agreement under which Alabama Power operates Plant Greene County and Mississippi Power reimburses Alabama Power for its proportionate share of non-fuel operations and maintenance expenses, which totaled $7 million, $5 million, and $6 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. See Notes 2 and 5 under \"Mississippi Power -Integrated Resource Plans\" and \"Joint Ownership Agreements,\" respectively, for additional information.\n\nAlabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power each have agreements with PowerSecure for equipment purchases and/or services related to utility infrastructure construction, distributed energy, and energy efficiency projects. Costs under these agreements were immaterial for all periods presented.\n\nSouthern Company Gas has a $74 million contract with the U.S. General Services Administration to increase energy efficiency at certain federal buildings across Georgia, which is expected to be completed in 2025. Southern Company Gas engaged PowerSecure to provide the majority of the construction services under the contract. During 2024, 2023, and 2022, Southern Company Gas paid $13 million, $29 million, and $10 million, respectively, to PowerSecure related to this agreement.\n\nSee Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for information regarding Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's equity method investment in SEGCO and related affiliate purchased power costs, as well as Alabama Power's gas pipeline ownership agreement with SEGCO.\n\nSouthern Power has several agreements with SCS for transmission services, which are billed to Southern Power based on the Southern Company Open Access Transmission Tariff as filed with the FERC. Transmission services purchased by Southern Power from SCS totaled $25 million, $33 million, and $39 million for 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively, and were charged to other operations and maintenance expenses in Southern Power's consolidated statements of income.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power may jointly enter into various types of wholesale energy, natural gas, and certain other contracts, either directly or through SCS as agent. Each participating company may be jointly and severally liable for the obligations incurred under these agreements. See Note 14 under \"Contingent Features\" for additional information. Southern Power and the traditional electric operating companies generally settle amounts related to the above transactions on a monthly basis in the month following the performance of such services or the purchase or sale of electricity. See \"Revenues - Southern Power\" herein for additional information.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas provide incidental services to and receive such services from other Southern Company subsidiaries which are generally minor in duration and amount. Except as described herein, the traditional electric operating companies, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas neither provided nor received any material services to or from affiliates in any year presented.\n\n## Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and the natural gas distribution utilities are subject to accounting requirements for the effects of rate regulation. Regulatory assets represent probable future revenues associated with certain costs that are expected to be recovered from customers through the ratemaking process. Regulatory liabilities represent costs recovered that are ex pected to be incurred in the future or probable future reductions in revenues associated with amounts that are expected to be credited to customers through the ratemaking process.\n\nIn the event that a portion of a traditional electric operating company's or a natural gas distribution utility's operations is no longer subject to applicable accounting rules for rate regulation, such company would be required to write off to income or reclassify to AOCI related regulatory assets and liabilities that are not specifically recoverable through regulated rates. In addition, the traditional electric operating company or the natural gas distribution utility would be required to determine if any impairment to other assets, including plant, ex ists and write down the assets, if impaired, to their fair values. All regulatory assets and liabilities are to be reflected in rates. See Note 2 for additional information including details of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected in the balance sheets for Southern Company, the traditional electric operating companies, and Southern Company Gas.\n\n## Revenues\n\nThe Registrants generate revenues from a variety of sources which are accounted for under various revenue accounting guidance, including revenue from contracts with customers, lease, derivative, and regulatory accounting.

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company disclosed a total project capital cost forecast of $10.753 billion for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with $10.564 billion already invested and only $189 million remaining to complete the project. This forecast was directly tied to Georgia Power's regulatory approval in December 2023, which allowed the recovery of $7.562 billion in construction and capital costs, resolving long-standing prudence issues. Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Southern Company, had previously absorbed significant charges totaling over $1.1 billion due to uncertainty around cost recovery, but the 2023 approval led to a $228 million pre-tax credit. In 2024, Southern Company maintained its stake in Georgia Power, ensuring continued influence over how future nuclear construction cost implications\u2014especially those tied to potential overruns or regulatory decisions\u2014are managed and recovered through retail rates.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power was identified as negatively impacting Southern Company's financial condition due to potential uninsured losses and ongoing litigation risks, particularly tied to the Kemper County energy facility and joint-use agreements. This risk exposure contributed to Southern Company's net regulatory liabilities, which stood at $208 million at the end of 2023, including a $30 million net gain liability tied to Alabama Power. By 2024, Alabama Power contributed $3 million toward the amortization of net gain, which helped reduce Southern Company's overall net regulatory liabilities to $189 million by year-end. This indicates a strategic effort to stabilize and improve the regulatory asset/liability position over time, despite ongoing challenges from Alabama Power's operational and legal risks.",

      "answer": "The Progress Energy segment's prefunded pension increased from $379 million in 2022 to $463 million in 2024, contributing to an overall increase in Duke Energy's prefunded pension from $780 million to $863 million. This led to a corresponding increase in Duke Energy's net asset recognized from $703 million to $863 million. The growth in prefunded pension assets suggests a more aggressive pension funding strategy by the company over this period, particularly within the Progress Energy segment, which maintained a significant portion of these funds.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy reported $592 million in total remaining performance obligations for the Piedmont segment, with $71 million recognized in that year. Following the 2022 restructuring, Piedmont became part of the GU&I segment in 2023. This segment now operates under tailored, regulatory-approved pricing structures that are customer-class-specific, directly influencing how performance obligations are fulfilled and revenue is recognized. As a result, the $521 million in remaining obligations beyond 2022 (from 2023 onward) are now managed within the GU&I regulatory framework, which emphasizes distinct service expectations, demand requirements, and pricing strategies across different customer classes.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 Piedmont: Duke Energy disclosed $592 million in total remaining performance obligations for the Piedmont segment in 2022, with $71 million recognized that year.",
        "Hop 2: Piedmont \u2192 GU&I: In 2023, Piedmont was integrated into the GU&I segment, which includes natural gas distribution, storage, and renewable gas investments, and operates under regulatory accounting treatment.",
        "Hop 3: GU&I \u2190 DUK(2023): The GU&I segment in 2023 operates under tailored regulatory pricing structures by customer class, which now governs how the previously disclosed Piedmont obligations are fulfilled and revenue is recognized."

      "question": "How did Alabama Power's amortization timeline for deferred gains and losses from interest rate derivatives change between Southern Company's 2022 and 2024 filings, and what does this reveal about the long-term hedging strategy for its interest rate exposure?",
      "answer": "In Southern Company's 2022 filing, Alabama Power was noted as having deferred gains and losses from interest rate derivatives expected to be amortized into earnings through 2052. By the 2024 filing, this timeline remained unchanged for Alabama Power, while other subsidiaries like Southern Company and Georgia Power extended their amortization periods to 2054. This reveals that Alabama Power's long-term hedging strategy maintains a consistent multi-decade outlook aligned with the broader Southern Company framework, despite evolving interest rate environments.",

      "question": "How did the regulatory amortization relationship between Southern Company's Georgia Power segment and its financial disclosures evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in light of Georgia Power's negative impact on Southern Company's financial condition in 2023 and the changes in regulatory amortization balances in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power was identified as negatively impacting Southern Company's financial condition due to potential uninsured losses and retrospective assessments, including a maximum annual NEIL assessment of $89 million. Georgia Power disclosed $0 in regulatory amortization in 2023, indicating no immediate regulatory recovery mechanism for these risks. By 2024, Southern Company's Mississippi Power segment reported $39 million in regulatory amortization, up from $50 million in 2023, suggesting a shift in how regulatory costs were being amortized across segments. This evolution implies that while Georgia Power's risks remained, Southern Company may have adjusted its regulatory strategy, potentially reallocating amortization burdens away from Georgia Power toward other segments like Mississippi Power, which saw a decrease in its regulatory amortization balance year-over-year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Georgia Power: Georgia Power posed financial risk to Southern Company due to potential $89M NEIL assessment and uninsured losses from nuclear plant insurance policies.",
        "Hop 2: Georgia Power \u2192 Regulatory Amortization: Georgia Power disclosed $0 in regulatory amortization in 2023, indicating no immediate regulatory relief for its financial risks.",
        "Hop 3: Regulatory Amortization \u2190 SO(2024): Southern Company's Mississippi Power segment reported $39M in regulatory amortization in 2024, down from $50M in 2023, suggesting a reallocation of regulatory costs."

By 2024, this exposure had increased to $1,042 million, and the weighted average interest rate had risen to 3.38%. This increase in both the amount of exposure and the associated interest rate significantly elevated Alabama Power's contribution to Southern Company's overall interest rate risk. The company's total long-term variable interest rate exposure grew from $4,464 million in 2021 to $4,727 million in 2024, and Alabama Power's share rose from 18.7% to 22.0%, indicating a disproportionate increase in risk concentration within this segment.",

In the 2024 filing, the company reported a $3 million projected obligation for these benefits as of December 31, 2024, based on a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. While the metrics measure different aspects (payments vs. obligations), the $3 million projected obligation in 2024 represents a sensitivity analysis showing potential volatility in future reporting periods. The 2024 filing also indicated that Southern Company Gas' sensitivity to discount rate changes remained consistent at $2 million for both increases and decreases, suggesting stable modeling assumptions despite the shift in reported figures.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company Gas reported Total Other Operations and Maintenance expenses of $1,176 million, which was a key component of the broader Southern Company's $6,573 million in Total Other Operations and Maintenance expenses for that year. By 2023, Southern Company Gas' Total Other Operations and Maintenance costs rose slightly to $1,194 million, while the overall Total Other Operations and Maintenance expenses for Southern Company decreased to $6,093 million. This indicates that while Southern Company Gas increased its operational spending year-over-year, the broader company experienced a reduction in other operations and maintenance costs, suggesting a shift in cost structure or allocation across business segments.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Southern Company Gas: Southern Company Gas reported $1,176 million in Total Other Operations and Maintenance expenses in 2022.",

      "question": "How did the change in Duke Energy's prefunded post-retirement benefit obligations for the Piedmont segment from 2022 to 2023 relate to the corresponding shift in intercompany income tax liabilities within the same segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy reported a $7 million prefunded post-retirement benefit for the Piedmont segment, which increased to $10 million in 2023. During the same period, the intercompany income tax liabilities for the Piedmont segment rose from $38 million in 2022 to $57 million in 2023. While both metrics increased, the evidence does not explicitly disclose a direct regulatory or accounting linkage between the prefunded post-retirement benefit and the intercompany tax liabilities. Therefore, the relationship remains correlational based on the available data, with no definitive causal mechanism provided in the filings.",

      "question": "How did the financial risk exposure of Georgia Power through its nuclear liability at Plant Vogtle evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what implications did this have for Southern Company's overall risk profile?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power was exposed to a maximum annual retrospective assessment of $89 million under NEIL nuclear insurance policies, which could have had a material impact on Southern Company's financial condition in the event of a loss at Plant Vogtle. By 2024, Georgia Power had ongoing capital commitments tied to Plant Vogtle Unit 1 and 2 upgrades, with a projected $112 MW of incremental capacity improvements planned by 2028, indicating continued strategic reliance on the plant. This evolution suggests that despite ongoing insurance risk exposure in 2023, Southern Company, through Georgia Power, remained committed to enhancing Plant Vogtle's capacity in 2024, thereby increasing long-term asset dependency while maintaining exposure to nuclear-specific financial liabilities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Georgia Power: Southern Company was exposed to Georgia Power's financial risks, including a $89 million maximum annual NEIL insurance assessment in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Georgia Power \u2192 Plant Vogtle: Georgia Power owns a 45.7% stake in Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2, which are nuclear assets subject to NEIL insurance policies and potential liability.",
        "Hop 3: Plant Vogtle \u2190 SO(2024): By 2024, Georgia Power (a Southern Company subsidiary) planned $112 MW of incremental capacity upgrades at Plant Vogtle, demonstrating continued investment and risk exposure in the plant."

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Georgia Power's deferred regulatory liabilities from $58 million in 2022 to $85 million in 2023 reflect changes in the regulatory scrutiny and cost recovery uncertainties related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the construction status and cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. External monitors evaluated the completeness of disclosures around uncertainties in cost recovery, and Deloitte auditors conducted extensive inquiries and inspections to ensure proper financial statement disclosures. By 2023, this scrutiny translated into a rise in deferred regulatory liabilities from $58 million to $85 million, indicating that Georgia Power had accumulated greater obligations tied to future regulatory decisions, likely due to ongoing uncertainties in cost recovery and construction timelines.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty regarding the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, prompting extensive audit procedures by Deloitte to assess the completeness of disclosures and potential risks to cost recovery. These uncertainties were reflected in Georgia Power's regulatory hedging activities, which included $21 million in 'Other Deferred Charges and Assets' related to derivatives designated for regulatory purposes in 2022. By 2023, the consolidated balance of 'Other Deferred Charges and Assets' for Georgia Power decreased to $29 million from $56 million in 2022, indicating a material reduction in deferred regulatory assets, potentially linked to the resolution or reclassification of Plant Vogtle-related hedging instruments.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Georgia Power's deferred regulatory liabilities from $58 million in 2022 to $85 million in 2023 reflect changes in the regulatory scrutiny and cost recovery uncertainties related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the construction status, cost forecasts, and ultimate cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. This scrutiny was tied to uncertainties in financial disclosures and potential risks to cost recovery. By 2023, this regulatory pressure translated into a rise in deferred regulatory liabilities from $58 million to $85 million, indicating increased deferrals of regulatory costs, likely due to ongoing delays or unresolved recovery issues. This evolution shows that the earlier regulatory concerns directly influenced the financial obligations carried forward into 2023.",

      "question": "How did the financial risk exposure from Georgia Power's nuclear insurance liabilities in 2023 influence Southern Company's strategic decisions regarding Plant Vogtle's capacity upgrades and capital investments in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power faced a maximum annual retrospective assessment of $89 million under NEIL nuclear insurance policies, which could have had a material impact on Southern Company's financial condition in the event of an uninsured loss. As a co-owner and operator of Plant Vogtle, Georgia Power's exposure to these liabilities likely factored into Southern Company's strategic planning for the plant. By 2024, this risk context appears to have influenced Southern Company's decision to pursue capacity upgrades at Plant Vogtle, with plans for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028. Additionally, Georgia Power had already invested $760 million in new generation projects\u2014including combustion turbines and battery storage\u2014indicating a broader strategy to diversify and strengthen its generation mix while enhancing Plant Vogtle\u2019s performance to offset potential insurance-related financial risks.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Georgia Power: Georgia Power faced a $89 million maximum annual retrospective insurance assessment risk under NEIL policies in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Georgia Power \u2192 Plant Vogtle: Georgia Power owns a 45.7% stake in Plant Vogtle and operates the plant, making it a key asset in their portfolio and risk mitigation strategy.",
        "Hop 3: Plant Vogtle \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, Southern Company, through Georgia Power, planned incremental capacity upgrades at Plant Vogtle (112 MWs) and invested $760 million in new generation projects, including upgrades at the plant."

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2022 fuel cost increases, particularly the 35.7% rise in natural gas prices, affect energy revenues in 2024 through changes in generation availability and power purchase agreement dynamics?",
      "answer": "Southern Company's 2022 fuel costs, especially the 35.7% increase in natural gas prices, led to higher generation costs and affected the availability of cost-effective generation resources. This influenced the company's energy cost recovery clause mechanism, which offsets energy expenses through revenues. However, by 2024, energy revenues decreased by $58 million compared to 2023, primarily due to lower fuel and purchased power prices. Despite the 2022 cost pressures, the subsequent drop in fuel prices in 2024 reduced the energy component of PPA revenues, particularly at traditional operating companies and Southern Power. While increased KWH sales under natural gas and solar PPAs partially offset the decline, the overall energy revenue drop reflects how changes in fuel costs and generation availability directly impacted revenue streams tied to energy pricing dynamics in PPAs.",

See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power\" for additional information.\n\n(b) Average cost of purchased power includes fuel, energy, and transmission purchased by Alabama Power for tolling agreements where power is generated by the provider.\n\nFuel and purchased power expenses were $1.6 billion in 2021, an increase of $314 million, or 24.4%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $196 million increase in the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $117 million net increase related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.\n\nFuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings, since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause.

See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate ECR\" for additional information.\n\n## Fuel\n\nFuel expense was $1.2 billion in 2021, an increase of $265 million, or 27.3%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 35.7% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, which excludes tolling agreements, a 25.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and an 8.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro, partially offset by a 6.7% decrease in the average cost of nuclear fuel per KWH generated and a 3.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.\n\n## Purchased Power -Non-Affiliates\n\nPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $221 million in 2021, an increase of $30 million, or 15.7%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a 19.4% increase in the amount of energy purchased due to a new PPA that began in September 2020 and a 10.6% increase in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of higher natural gas prices.\n\nEnergy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.\n\n## Purchased Power -Affiliates\n\nPurchased power expense from affiliates was $147 million in 2021, an increase of $19 million, or 14.8%, compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to an 87.4% increase in the average cost of purchased power per KWH as a result of higher natural gas prices, partially offset by a 38.8% decrease in the volume of KWH purchased as Alabama Power's units generally dispatched at a lower cost than other available Southern Company system resources.",

Alabama Power, as agent for SEGCO, indicated plans to retire Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (1,000 MWs). These plans are expected to be completed on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. The NOPP submittals are subject to the review of the ADEM. Retirement of Plant Barry Unit 5 could occur as early as 2023, subject to completion of the acquisition of the Calhoun Generating Station and certain operating conditions. See Notes 2 and 7 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Certificates of Convenience and Necessity\" and \"SEGCO,\" respectively, for additional information.\n\nThe assets for which Alabama Power has indicated retirement, due to early closure or repowering of the unit to natural gas, have net book values totaling approximately $1.5 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through Rate CNP Compliance) at December 31, 2021. Based on an Alabama PSC order, Alabama Power is authorized to establish a regulatory asset to record the unrecovered investment costs, including the plant asset balance and the site removal and closure costs, associated with unit retirements caused by environmental regulations (Environmental Accounting Order). Under the Environmental Accounting Order, the regulatory asset would be amortized and recovered over an affected unit's remaining useful life, as established prior to the decision regarding early retirement, through Rate CNP Compliance. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate CNP Compliance\" and \" - Environmental Accounting Order\" for additional information.\n\nGeorgia Power submitted its NOPP to the Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) indicating plans to retire Plant Wansley Units 1 and 2 (926 MWs based on 53.5% ownership), Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) on or before the compliance date of December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to pursue compliance with the ELG Reconsideration Rule for Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership) through the voluntary incentive program by no later than December 31, 2028. Georgia Power intends to comply with the ELG Rules for Plant Bowen Units 3 and 4 through the generally applicable requirements by December 31, 2025; therefore, no NOPP submission was required for these units. The NOPP submittals and generally applicable requirements are subject to the review of the Georgia EPD.\n\nThe units for which Georgia Power has indicated early retirement plans have net book values totaling approximately $2.2 billion (excluding capitalized asset retirement costs which are recovered through the ECCR tariff) at December 31, 2021. A final decision regarding the future operation of Georgia Power's impacted units and the timing of any retirements are subject to review by the Georgia PSC as a part of Georgia Power's 2022 IRP proceeding. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power Integrated Resource Plan\" for additional information.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\nThe ELG Reconsideration Rule is expected to require capital expenditures and increased operational costs for the traditional electric operating companies and SEGCO. However, the ultimate impact of the ELG Reconsideration Rule will depend on the Southern Company system's final assessment of compliance options, the incorporation of these assessments into each of the traditional electric operating company's IRP process, the incorporation of these new requirements into each plant's NPDES permit, and the outcome of legal challenges. The ELG Reconsideration Rule has been challenged by several environmental organizations and the cases have been consolidated in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. The case is being held in abeyance while the EPA undertakes a new rulemaking to revise the ELG Reconsideration Rule. A proposed rule is expected in the fall of 2022. Any revisions could require changes in the traditional electric operating companies' compliance strategies.\n\n## Coal Combustion Residuals\n\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized non-hazardous solid waste regulations for the management and disposal of CCR, including coal ash and gypsum, in landfills and surface impoundments (ash ponds) at active electric generating power plants. The CCR Rule requires landfills and ash ponds to be evaluated against a set of performance criteria and potentially closed if certain criteria are not met. Closure of existing landfills and ash ponds requires installation of equipment and infrastructure to manage CCR in accordance with the CCR Rule. In addition to the federal CCR Rule, the States of Alabama and Georgia finalized state regulations regarding the management and disposal of CCR within their respective states. In 2019, the State of Georgia received partial approval from the EPA for its state CCR permitting program. The State of Mississippi has not developed a state CCR permit program.\n\nThe Holistic Approach to Closure: Part A rule, finalized in August 2020, revised the deadline to stop sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to unlined surface impoundments to April 11, 2021 and established a process for the EPA to approve extensions to the deadline. The traditional electric operating companies stopped sending CCR and non-CCR wastes to their unlined impoundments prior to April 11, 2021 and, therefore, did not submit requests for extensions. On January 11, 2022, the EPA proposed determinations on deadline extension requests for other non-affiliated facilities, which reflected its positions on a variety of CCR Rule compliance requirements including closure standards, groundwater monitoring, and corrective action. The traditional electric operating companies are in the process of reviewing these determinations to determine how the EPA's current positions may",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's 2022 infrastructure investment plans through Atlanta Gas Light's System Reinforcement Rider relate to the maximum annual nuclear insurance liability assessed to Georgia Power in 2024, considering the distinct regulatory recovery mechanisms in place for each segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company, through Atlanta Gas Light, had a System Reinforcement Rider approved by the Georgia PSC that was expected to recover $286 million in capital investments for infrastructure improvements from 2022 through 2024. This gas infrastructure investment was tied to a regulatory recovery mechanism specific to Atlanta Gas Light, designed to ensure cost recovery for pipeline reliability projects. By 2024, Georgia Power, another Southern Company subsidiary in the nuclear energy segment, was subject to a maximum annual nuclear insurance liability of $71 million per incident, part of a broader $473 million total liability cap across its reactor fleet. While both entities operate under Southern Company, the filings explicitly state that Atlanta Gas Light does not share the same cost recovery mechanisms as the nuclear segment. Therefore, the $286 million infrastructure investment plan and the $473 million nuclear insurance liability are governed by separate regulatory frameworks with no direct financial linkage or cost-sharing provisions.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nAtlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC previously agreed to a variation of the Integrated Customer Growth Program to extend pipeline facilities to serve customers in areas without pipeline access and create new economic development opportunities in Georgia. A separate tariff provides recovery of up to $15 million annually for strategic economic development projects approved by the Georgia PSC.\n\nSee \"Rate Proceedings - Atlanta Gas Light\" herein for additional information regarding the Georgia PSC's November 18, 2021 approval of Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM filing and Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan. The Georgia PSC also approved a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects, which is expected to recover related capital investments totaling $286 million for the years 2022 through 2024.\n\n## Chattanooga Gas\n\nIn June 2021, the Tennessee Public Utilities Commission approved Chattanooga Gas' pipeline replacement program to replace approximately 73 miles of distribution main over a seven-year period. The estimated total cost of the program is $118 million, which will be recovered through Chattanooga Gas' annual base rate review mechanism.\n\n## Natural Gas Cost Recovery\n\nWith the exception of Atlanta Gas Light, the natural gas distribution utilities are authorized by the relevant regulatory agencies in the states in which they serve to use natural gas cost recovery mechanisms that adjust rates to reflect changes in the wholesale cost of natural gas and ensure recovery of all costs prudently incurred in purchasing natural gas for customers. The natural gas distribution utilities defer or accrue the difference between the actual cost of natural gas and the amount of commodity revenue earned in a given period. The deferred or accrued amount is either billed or refunded to customers prospectively through adjustments to the commodity rate. Deferred natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory assets and accrued natural gas costs are reflected as regulatory liabilities. Changes in the billing factor will not have a significant effect on Southern Company's or Southern Company Gas' net income, but will affect cash flows. Since Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas directly to its end-use customers, it does not utilize a traditional natural gas cost recovery mechanism. However, Atlanta Gas Light does maintain natural gas inventory for the Marketers in Georgia and recovers the cost through recovery mechanisms approved by the Georgia PSC. At December 31, 2021, the under recovered balance was $473 million, $266 million of which was included in natural gas cost under recovery and $207 million of which was included in other regulatory assets, deferred on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets. At December 31, 2020, the over recovered balance was $88 million, which was included in other regulatory liabilities on Southern Company's and Southern Company Gas' balance sheets.\n\n## Rate Proceedings\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn 2019, the Illinois Commission approved a $168 million annual base rate increase effective October 8, 2019. The base rate increase included $65 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.73% and an equity ratio of 54.2%. Additionally, the Illinois Commission approved a volume balancing adjustment, a revenue decoupling mechanism for residential customers that provides a benchmark level of revenue per rate class for recovery.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a $240 million annual base rate increase effective November 24, 2021. The base rate increase included $94 million related to the recovery of program costs under the Investing in Illinois program and was based on a ROE of 9.75% and an equity ratio of 54.5%.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn 2019, the Georgia PSC approved a $65 million annual base rate increase, effective January 1, 2020, based on a ROE of 10.25% and an equity ratio of 56%. Earnings will be evaluated against a ROE range of 10.05% to 10.45%, with disposition of any earnings above 10.45% to be determined by the Georgia PSC. Additionally, the Georgia PSC approved continuation of the previously authorized inclusion in base rates of the recovery of and return on the infrastructure program investments, including, but not limited to, GRAM adjustments, and a reauthorization and continuation of GRAM until terminated by the Georgia PSC. GRAM filing rate adjustments will be based on the authorized ROE of 10.25%. GRAM adjustments for 2021 could not exceed 5% of 2020 base rates. The 5% limitation does not set a precedent in any future rate proceedings by Atlanta Gas Light.\n\nIn July 2020, Atlanta Gas Light filed its annual GRAM filing with the Georgia PSC requesting an annual base rate increase of $37.6 million based on the projected 12-month period beginning January 1, 2021, which did not exceed the 5% limitation established by the Georgia PSC. Rates went into effect on January 1, 2021 in accordance with Atlanta Gas Light's 2019 rate case order.",

The DOE has yet to commence performance of its contractual and statutory obligation to dispose of spent nuclear fuel. Consequently, Alabama Power and Georgia Power pursued and continue to pursue legal remedies against the U.S. government for its partial breach of contract.\n\nIn 2014, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed their third round of lawsuits against the U.S. government in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking damages for the costs of continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2013. The damage period was subsequently extended to December 31, 2014. In 2019, the Court of Federal Claims granted Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's motion for summary judgment on damages not disputed by the U.S. government, awarding those undisputed damages to Alabama Power and Georgia Power.\n\nIn 2017, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed their fourth round of lawsuits against the U.S. government in the Court of Federal Claims, seeking damages for the costs of continuing to store spent nuclear fuel at Plants Farley, Hatch, and Vogtle Units 1 and 2 for the period from January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2017. In 2020, Alabama Power and Georgia Power filed amended complaints in those fourth-round lawsuits adding damages incurred from January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019 to the claim period.\n\nOn June 7, 2024, and August 15, 2024, the Court of Federal Claims entered final judgments on the remaining damages in the third and fourth round of lawsuits, respectively, awarding Alabama Power a total of approximately $100 million and Georgia Power a total of approximately $121 million (based on its ownership interests), which represent claims for the period from January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2019. This represents recovery on all claims that Alabama Power and Georgia Power have filed against the U.S. government to date.\n\nOn December 3, 2024, the Alabama PSC directed Alabama Power to return the award, which was reflected as a regulatory liability at December 31, 2024, to customers through bill credits during the months of January, February, and March 2025. During the third quarter 2024, Georgia Power credited the award to accounts where the original costs were charged, which reduced rate base, fuel, and cost of service for the benefit of customers, as previously authorized by the Georgia PSC. As a result of this regulatory treatment, there will be no material impact on Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, or Georgia Power's net income.\n\nDamages will continue to accumulate until the issue is resolved, the U.S. government disposes of Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's spent nuclear fuel pursuant to its contractual obligations, or alternative storage is otherwise provided. However, Alabama Power and Georgia Power expect to credit any future recoveries for the benefit of customers in accordance with direction from their respective PSC; therefore, no material impact on Southern Company's, Alabama Power's, or Georgia Power's net income is expected.\n\nOn-site dry spent fuel storage facilities are operational at all three plants and can be ex panded to accommodate spent fuel through the ex pected life of each plant.\n\n## Nuclear Insurance\n\nUnder the Price-Anderson Amendments Act (Act), Alabama Power and Georgia Power maintain agreements of indemnity with the NRC that, together with private insurance, cover third-party liability arising from any nuclear incident occurring at the companies' nuclear power plants. The Act provides funds up to $16.3 billion for public liability claims that could arise from a single nuclear incident. Each nuclear plant is insured against this liability to a max imum of $500 million by American Nuclear Insurers (ANI), with the remaining coverage provided by a mandatory program of deferred premiums that could be assessed, after a nuclear incident, against all owners of commercial nuclear reactors. A company could be assessed up to $166 million per incident for each licensed reactor it operates but not more than an aggregate of $25 million per incident to be paid in a calendar year for each reactor. Such max imum assessment, excluding any applicable state premium taxes, for Alabama Power and Georgia Power, based on its ownership and buyback interests in all licensed reactors, is $332 million and $473 million, respectively, per incident, but not more than an aggregate of $49 million and $71 million, respectively, to be paid for each incident in any one year. Both the maximum assessment per reactor and the maximum yearly assessment are adjusted for inflation at least every five years. The next scheduled adjustment is due no later than November 1, 2028.

By 2024, Georgia Power had no exposure at the BBB and/or Baa2 credit rating level, indicating a strategic shift or resolution in the financial treatment of the project, likely reflecting reduced uncertainty or a transfer of risk.

      "question": "How did the increase in Virginia Natural Gas' base rate revenues from the 2022 rate case compare to the earlier 2020 rate case approval in terms of requested vs. approved amounts and equity ratios, and what does this indicate about the company's regulatory strategy evolution?",
      "answer": "In 2020, Virginia Natural Gas requested a $50 million increase in base rate revenues and was approved $43 million with an equity ratio of 51.9%. In 2022, the company requested a $69 million increase and was approved $48 million with a lower equity ratio of 49.06%. Despite a larger requested increase in 2022, the approved amount was proportionally smaller, and the equity ratio was adjusted downward, indicating a more conservative regulatory strategy or tighter scrutiny from the Virginia Commission. This evolution suggests a recalibration in how Virginia Natural Gas structures its rate case proposals and capital recovery expectations.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nOn February 16, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved a stipulation between Atlanta Gas Light and the Georgia PSC staff establishing a long-range comprehensive planning process. Under the terms of the stipulation, Atlanta Gas Light was required to develop and file at least triennially an Integrated Capacity and Delivery Plan (i-CDP). Each i-CDP will include a 10-year forecast of interstate and intrastate capacity asset requirements, including a detailed plan for the first three years consistent with Atlanta Gas Light's current capacity supply plan, and a 10-year projection of capital budgets and related operations and maintenance spending. Recovery of the related revenue requirements will be included in either subsequent annual GRAM filings or a new System Reinforcement Rider for authorized large pressure improvement and system reliability projects.\n\nOn April 28, 2021, Atlanta Gas Light filed its first i-CDP with the Georgia PSC, which includes a series of ongoing and proposed pipeline safety, reliability, and growth programs for the next 10 years (2022 through 2031), as well as the required capital investments and related costs to implement the programs. The i-CDP reflected capital investments totaling approximately $0.5 billion to $0.6 billion annually.\n\nOn November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved an October 14, 2021 joint stipulation agreement between Atlanta Gas Light and the staff of the Georgia PSC, under which, for the years 2022 through 2024, Atlanta Gas Light will incrementally reduce its combined GRAM and System Reinforcement Rider request by 10% through Atlanta Gas Light's GRAM mechanism, or $5 million for 2022. The stipulation agreement also provides for $1.7 billion of total capital investment for the years 2022 through 2024. Also on November 18, 2021, the Georgia PSC approved Atlanta Gas Light's amended annual GRAM filing, which resulted in an annual rate increase of $43 million effective January 1, 2022.\n\n## Virginia Natural Gas\n\nOn September 14, 2021, the Virginia Commission approved a stipulation agreement related to Virginia Natural Gas' June 2020 general rate case filing, which allows for a $43 million increase in annual base rate revenues, including $14 million related to the recovery of investments under the SAVE program, based on a ROE of 9.5% and an equity ratio of 51.9%. Interim rate adjustments became effective as of November 1, 2020, subject to refund, based on Virginia Natural Gas' original request for an increase of approximately $50 million. Refunds to customers related to the difference between the approved rates and the interim rates were completed during the fourth quarter 2021.\n\n## Deferral of Incremental COVID-19 Costs\n\nAs discussed under \"Utility Regulation and Rate Design,\" the natural gas distribution utilities have various regulatory mechanisms to recover bad debt expense, which helped mitigate potential increases in bad debt expense as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Deferred incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic were immaterial for Virginia Natural Gas.\n\n## Atlanta Gas Light\n\nIn April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Georgia PSC approved orders directing Atlanta Gas Light to continue its previous, voluntary suspension of customer disconnections. In June 2020, the Georgia PSC ordered Atlanta Gas Light to resume customer disconnections beginning July 2020, with exceptions for customers still covered by a shelter-in-place order. All suspensions for customer disconnections were lifted in October 2020. The orders provide the Marketers, including SouthStar, with a mechanism to receive credits from Atlanta Gas Light for the base rates it charged to the Marketers of non-paying customers during the suspension. Atlanta Gas Light will begin recovering these credits through GRAM rates effective January 1, 2023.\n\n## Nicor Gas\n\nIn March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Illinois Commission issued an order directing utilities to cease disconnections for non-payment and to suspend the imposition of late payment fees or penalties. In June 2020, the Illinois Commission approved a stipulation pursuant to which Nicor Gas and other utilities in Illinois would provide more flexible credit and collection procedures to assist customers with financial hardship and which authorizes a special purpose rider for recovery of the following COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts: incremental costs directly associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, net of the offset for COVID-19 pandemic-related credits received, foregone late fees, foregone reconnection charges, and the costs associated with a bill payment assistance program. Nicor Gas resumed late payment fees in July 2020 and, on October 1, 2020, began recovery of the COVID-19 pandemic-related impacts through the special purpose rider, which will continue over a 24-month period. On March 18, 2021, the Illinois Commission approved a phased-in schedule for disconnections related to non-payment. Nicor Gas began certain disconnections in late April 2021 and resumed normal disconnections in June 2021. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Nicor Gas' related regulatory asset was $5 million and $9 million, respectively.",

      "answer": "In the 2022 filing, Alabama Power was disclosed as a key subsidiary involved in generation and purchased power, setting the stage for its role in future compliance costs. By 2024, Southern Company's consolidated estimate for 2025 environmental compliance costs totaled $729 million, with Alabama Power specifically accounting for $364 million\u2014nearly half of the total obligation. This indicates a growing emphasis on environmental compliance, particularly under the CCR Rule, which governs the closure and monitoring of surface impoundments and landfills. The significant allocation to Alabama Power suggests that Southern Company is directing more capital toward legacy environmental liabilities in this key operating segment, likely in response to regulatory pressure and long-term compliance planning.",

This significant stake in Plant Hatch, which had a total capacity of 1,796 MWs, highlights Southern Company's strategic reliance on Georgia Power as a key segment for nuclear energy generation. By 2024, Southern Company continued to affirm Georgia Power's integral role in its corporate structure, as evidenced by the inclusion of Georgia Power under Southern Company's Power of Attorney and board resolutions in the 2024 10-K filing.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company reported a long-term variable interest rate exposure of $4,464 million, with Alabama Power accounting for $834 million at a weighted average interest rate of 0.21%. By 2024, this exposure increased to $4,727 million company-wide, with Alabama Power's share rising to $1,042 million at a significantly higher weighted average interest rate of 3.38%. This increase in exposure and interest rate led to a rise in the impact on annualized interest expense from $45 million (in 2022) to $47 million (in 2024) for a 100 basis point change in interest rates, indicating a heightened sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations.",

      "answer": "Southern Company Gas's exposure to discount rate fluctuations in their other postretirement benefit plans decreased from $6 million in 2022 to $3 million in 2024, as reported in the sensitivity analyses. This reduction in sensitivity indicates improved liability risk management, suggesting that the segment has either adjusted plan assumptions or taken actions to better align obligations with funding levels. Additionally, the 2024 disclosures show that Southern Company Gas maintains margin accounts with $17 million in cash collateral, reflecting a proactive approach to managing financial exposures, including those tied to benefit obligations.",

        "Hop 2: Projected Obligation for Other Postretirement Benefit Plans \u2192 Southern Company Gas: The sensitivity analysis in 2024 shows a reduced impact of $3 million for a similar 25 basis point change in discount rate, indicating a decrease in exposure.",

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $17 million.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&amp;P, or Fitch or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit ex posure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their ex posure to counterparty credit risk.\n\nSouthern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investmentgrade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against",

      "question": "How did the relationship between Southern Company's deferred regulatory liabilities and Alabama Power's energy-related derivatives positions evolve from 2023 to 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company reported consolidated 'Other regulatory liabilities, deferred' at $231 million, with Alabama Power accounting for $48 million of this amount. By 2024, Southern Company's total deferred regulatory liabilities slightly decreased to $213 million, while Alabama Power\u2019s portion remained relatively stable at $45 million. During the same period, Alabama Power\u2019s net energy-related derivatives positions increased from a net $7 million in 2023 to $23 million in 2024, indicating a more active hedging posture. This suggests that despite a slight reduction in overall deferred liabilities at the parent level, Alabama Power maintained its regulatory liability exposure while increasing its use of derivatives, potentially to manage rate volatility within a shifting regulatory environment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Other regulatory liabilities, deferred: Southern Company disclosed $231 million in deferred regulatory liabilities in 2023, with $48 million attributed to Alabama Power.",

        "Hop 3: Alabama Power \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, Alabama Power\u2019s net energy-related derivatives liability increased to $23 million, indicating increased hedging activity, while its deferred regulatory liability remained stable at $45 million."

      "question": "How did the financial risk exposure related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in 2022 influence Georgia Power's allocation to cash equivalents and other assets by 2024, and what does this shift indicate about Southern Company's strategic liquidity management?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company (through its Georgia Power segment) faced significant financial and regulatory scrutiny over the uncertainties in cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, prompting heightened risk awareness and the need for stronger liquidity controls. By 2024, Georgia Power's investment portfolio showed a notable allocation of $10 million to 'Cash equivalents and other' (Level 1 assets), reflecting a strategic shift toward more liquid assets. This trend was further reinforced in 2024 with an increase to $79 million in 'Cash equivalents and other' under Georgia Power's assets, indicating a deliberate effort to maintain liquidity buffers in response to earlier project risks. This evolution suggests Southern Company adjusted its asset allocation strategy to better manage financial uncertainties tied to long-term capital projects.",

      "question": "How did the financial obligations and risk exposure of Georgia Power toward Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about Southern Company's long-term nuclear investment strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power faced a potential maximum annual NEIL policy assessment of $89 million due to its exposure as a nuclear plant operator, which directly impacted Southern Company's overall risk profile. By 2024, Georgia Power had ongoing capacity payment obligations tied to Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 totaling $35 million, with $4 million paid in 2024 alone. These payments are part of a long-term commitment that extends beyond 2029 and are required regardless of plant availability. Additionally, the decommissioning cost estimate for Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 was $1,036 million in 2024, with a completion date extending to 2092. This indicates that Southern Company continues to carry significant long-term financial exposure for its nuclear assets through Georgia Power, despite earlier risk concerns, suggesting a sustained strategic commitment to nuclear energy despite high costs and regulatory complexity.",

Each Registrant expects that a substantial amount of its future fuel needs will continue to be purchased under long-term commitments.\n\nGeorgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required whether or not any capacity is available. Portions of the capacity payments made to MEAG Power for its Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 investment relate to costs in ex cess of G eorgia Power's allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these portions at the time of the disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity is included in purchased power in Southern Company's statements of income and in purchased power, non-affiliates in Georgia Power's statements of income. Georgia Power's capacity payments related to this commitment totaled $4 million, $3 million, and $4 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. At December 31, 2024, Georgia Power's estimated long-term obligations related to this commitment totaled $35 million, consisting of $3 million for 2025, $2 million annually for 2026 through 2029, and $24 million thereafter.\n\nSee Note 9 for information regarding PPAs accounted for as leases.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nSCS may enter into various types of wholesale energy and natural gas contracts acting as an agent for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power.

Accordingly, Southern Company has entered into keep-well agreements with each of the traditional electric operating companies to ensure they will not subsidize or be responsible for any costs, losses, liabilities, or damages resulting from the inclusion of Southern Power as a contracting party under these agreements.\n\nAlabama Power has guaranteed a $100 million principal amount long-term bank loan SEGCO entered into in 2018 and subsequently extended and amended. Georgia Power has agreed to reimburse Alabama Power for the portion of such obligation corresponding to Georgia Power's proportionate ownership of SEGCO's stock if Alabama Power is called upon to make such payment under its guarantee. At December 31, 2024, the capitalization of SEGCO consisted of $56 million of equity and $80 million of long-term debt that matures in November 2025, on which the annual interest requirement is derived from a variable rate index. SEGCO had no short-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2024.

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's subsidiary Georgia Power faced a potential additional financial exposure of up to $460 million related to Plant Vogtle's cost-sharing provisions under the Global Amendments, on top of a $440 million pre-tax charge already recorded in 2021. By 2024, Georgia Power continued to hold undivided interests in Plant Vogtle alongside other co-owners and remained responsible for operating and maintaining the plant as their agent. The persistence of Georgia Power in this role, despite escalating costs and disputes over cost thresholds, indicates a strategic decision by Southern Company to maintain control over the project's execution and risk management. This demonstrates a continuation of Georgia Power's central role in the Plant Vogtle cost-sharing structure, with Southern Company likely absorbing increasing financial risk over time as construction costs exceeded initial estimates.",

In January 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).\n\nPursuant to the Global Amendments: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain adverse events occur, including, among other events: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public announcement of its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more from the seventeenth VCM report estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. The latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition, if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See Note 8 under \"Long-term Debt - DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings\" for additional information.\n\nGeorgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact the calculation. Based on the definition in the Global Amendments, Georgia Power believes the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and the current project capital cost forecast has triggered the cost-sharing provisions. The other V ogtle Owners have asserted that the project cost increases have reached the cost-sharing thresholds and have triggered the tender provisions under the Global Amendments. Georgia Power recorded an additional pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) associated with these cost-sharing and tender provisions, which is included in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $460 million associated with these provisions based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental charges associated with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. On October 29, 2021, Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners entered into an agreement to clarify the process for the tender provisions of the Global Amendments to provide for a decision between 120 and 180 days after the tender option is triggered, which the other Vogtle Owners assert occurred on February 14, 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE utilized reserve amortization, specifically $429 million in 2021 (disclosed in the 2022 filing), to offset storm restoration costs incurred by the FPL segment, aligning with regulatory mechanisms under the 2016 rate agreement to maintain a targeted ROE. By 2024, NEE's FPL segment had directed significant capital toward long-term infrastructure, with $9,185 million in capital expenditures in 2022 alone, reflecting a strategic emphasis on asset growth and service reliability. While the 2022 approach focused on short-term cost mitigation through reserve mechanisms, the 2024 data highlights a continuation of investment in core infrastructure, suggesting a complementary rather than shifting strategy across years.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\nCredit  Losses -NEE's credit department monitors current and forward credit exposure to counterparties and their affiliates. Prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness based on established standards and credit quality indicators. Credit quality indicators and standards that are closely monitored include credit ratings, certain financial ratios and delinquency trends which are based off the latest available information.  Customers  not  meeting  minimum  standards  provide  various  credit  enhancements  or  secured  payment  terms,  such  as  letters  of credit, the posting of margin cash collateral or use of master netting arrangements.\n\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, NEE recorded approximately $146 million, $94 million and $32 million of bad debt expense, including credit losses, respectively, which are included in O&amp;M expenses in NEE's consolidated statements of income. The amount for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily relates to credit losses at NEER driven by the operational and energy market impacts of severe prolonged winter weather in Texas in February 2021 (February 2021 weather event). The estimate for credit losses related to the impacts of the February 2021 weather event was developed based on NEE's assessment of the ultimate collectability of these receivables. At December 31, 2021, approximately $127 million of allowances are included in noncurrent other assets on NEE's consolidated balance sheet related to the February 2021 weather event.\n\nInventory -  FPL  values  materials,  supplies  and  fuel  inventory  using  a  weighted-average  cost  method.  NEER's  materials,  supplies  and  fuel inventories,  which  include  emissions  allowances  and  renewable  energy  credits,  are  carried  at  the  lower  of  weighted-average  cost  and  net realizable value, unless evidence indicates that the weighted-average cost will be recovered with a normal profit upon sale in the ordinary course of business.\n\nEnergy  Trading -  NEE  provides  full  energy  and  capacity  requirements  services  primarily  to  distribution  utilities,  which  include  load-following services and various ancillary services, in certain markets and engages in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to optimize the value of electricity and fuel contracts, generation facilities and gas infrastructure assets, as well as to take advantage of projected favorable commodity price movements. Trading contracts that meet the definition of a derivative are accounted for at fair value and realized gains and losses from all trading contracts, including those where physical delivery is required, are recorded net for all periods presented. See Note 3.\n\nStorm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery -  The  storm  and  property  insurance  reserve  funds  (storm  funds)  provide  coverage toward FPL's storm damage costs. Marketable securities held in the storm funds are carried at fair value. See Note 4. Fund earnings, consisting of  dividends,  interest  and  realized  gains  and  losses,  net  of  taxes,  are  reinvested  in  the  funds.  Fund  earnings,  as  well  as  any  changes  in unrealized gains and losses, are not recognized in income and are reflected as a corresponding adjustment to the storm and property insurance reserves (storm reserves). The tax effects of amounts not yet recognized for tax purposes are included in deferred income taxes. The storm funds are included in special use funds and the storm reserves in noncurrent regulatory liabilities, or in the case of a deficit, in regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, FPL's service area was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms, which resulted in the recording of incremental storm restoration costs. The FPL segment determined that it would not seek recovery of certain of such costs through a storm surcharge from customers and instead recorded such costs as storm restoration costs in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. The FPL segment used available reserve amortization to offset all such storm restoration costs that were expensed.\n\nRestoration costs associated with multiple storms since 2018 that impacted FPL's customers in the former Gulf Power service area are being collected from northwest Florida customers through a storm damage surcharge through late 2024 and are recorded as regulatory assets. As of December 31, 2021, the balance was $242 million, of which $92 million and $150 million are included in current regulatory assets and noncurrent regulatory assets, respectively, on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the balance was $347 million, of which $100 million and $247 million are included in current regulatory assets and noncurrent regulatory assets, respectively, on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.\n\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets - NEE evaluates long-lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The impairment loss to be recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the long-lived asset exceeds the asset's fair value. In most instances, the fair value is determined by discounting estimated future cash flows using an appropriate interest rate.\n\nImpairment  of  Equity  Method  Investments -  NEE  evaluates  its  equity  method  investments  for  impairment  when  events  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value and the investment may be other-than-temporarily impaired. An impairment loss is required to be recognized if the impairment is deemed to be other than temporary. Investments that are otherthan-temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated fair value and cannot subsequently be written back up for increases in estimated fair value. Impairment losses are recorded in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. See Note 4 - Nonrecurring Fair Value Measurements.",

The FPL segment's net income for 2021 and 2020 was $2,935 million and $2,650 million, respectively, representing an increase of $285 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher earnings from investments in plant in service and other property. Such investments grew the FPL segment's average retail rate base by approximately $3.3 billion in 2021 and reflect, among other things, solar generation additions and ongoing transmission and distribution additions.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, FPL's service area was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms, which resulted in the recording of incremental storm restoration costs. FPL determined that it would not seek recovery of certain of such costs through a storm surcharge from customers and instead recorded such costs as storm restoration costs in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. The FPL segment used available reserve amortization  to  offset  all  such  storm  restoration  costs  that  were  expensed.  See  Note  1  -  Storm  Funds,  Storm  Reserves  and  Storm  Cost Recovery.\n\nThe use of reserve amortization was permitted by the 2016 rate agreement. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement. In order to earn a targeted regulatory ROE, subject to limitations associated with the 2016 rate agreement, reserve amortization was calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&amp;M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortization is reversed so as not to exceed the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of the FPL segment's net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include wholesale and transmission service revenues  and  expenses,  cost  recovery  clause  revenues  and  expenses, AFUDC  -  equity  and  revenue  and  costs  not  recoverable  from  retail customers.  In  2021  and  2020,  the  FPL  segment  recorded  reserve  amortization  of  approximately  $429  million  and  the  reversal  of  reserve amortization of $1 million, respectively. The FPL segment's regulatory ROE for both 2021 and 2020 was approximately 11.60%.\n\nIn December 2021, the FPSC issued a final order approving the 2021 rate agreement which became effective in January 2022 and will remain in effect until at least December 2025, establishes FPL's allowed regulatory ROE at 10.60%, with a range of 9.70% to 11.70%, and allows for retail rate base increases in 2022 and 2023. In December 2021, Floridians Against Increased Rates, Inc. and, as a group in January 2022, Florida Rising, Inc., Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc., and League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida filed notices of appeal challenging the FPSC's final order approving the 2021 rate agreement, which notices of appeal are pending before the Florida Supreme Court. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 for additional information on the 2021 rate agreement.\n\nDuring 2021, operating revenues increased $938 million primarily related to higher fuel cost recovery revenues as discussed in cost recovery clauses below.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's fuel and other cost recovery mechanism balance revenues and expenses between 2022 and 2024, and what does this indicate about the stability of their cost recovery provisions over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that increases in fuel and other cost recovery revenues were primarily due to higher recoverable fuel costs, with electric rates structured so that fuel revenues generally equaled fuel expenses, including purchased power costs, and did not affect net income. This balancing mechanism was explicitly stated in the 2022 filings for both Mississippi Power and Alabama Power. By 2024, the company reported a $212 million decrease in retail electric revenues attributed to fuel and other cost recovery, indicating that the mechanism adjusted downward in response to lower fuel costs or other recoverable expenses.

      "answer": "FPL's 2022 capital expenditures of $6,785 million significantly expanded its retail rate base, which directly affected the calculation of reserve amortization under the 2021 rate agreement. This growth in rate base, driven by solar generation and transmission investments, increased the denominator in the reserve amortization formula that uses a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base. By 2024, this led to a decrease in reserve amortization adjustments, as evidenced by the $1,089 million reduction in amortization of deferred storm costs and the overall lower reserve amortization recorded that year. The 2021 rate agreement allowed for these adjustments to ensure FPL earned within the permitted ROE range of 9.70% to 11.70%, which was 11.60% in 2021 and continued to be managed through 2024.",

The FPL segment's net income for 2021 and 2020 was $2,935 million and $2,650 million, respectively, representing an increase of $285 million. The increase was primarily driven by higher earnings from investments in plant in service and other property. Such investments grew the FPL segment's average retail rate base by approximately $3.3 billion in 2021 and reflect, among other things, solar generation additions and ongoing transmission and distribution additions.\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020, FPL's service area was impacted by hurricanes and tropical storms, which resulted in the recording of incremental storm restoration costs. FPL determined that it would not seek recovery of certain of such costs through a storm surcharge from customers and instead recorded such costs as storm restoration costs in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of income. The FPL segment used available reserve amortization  to  offset  all  such  storm  restoration  costs  that  were  expensed.  See  Note  1  -  Storm  Funds,  Storm  Reserves  and  Storm  Cost Recovery.\n\nThe use of reserve amortization was permitted by the 2016 rate agreement. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2017 through December 2021 for additional information on the 2016 rate agreement. In order to earn a targeted regulatory ROE, subject to limitations associated with the 2016 rate agreement, reserve amortization was calculated using a trailing thirteen-month average of retail rate base and capital structure in conjunction with the trailing twelve months regulatory retail base net operating income, which primarily includes the retail base portion of base and other revenues, net of O&amp;M, depreciation and amortization, interest and tax expenses. In general, the net impact of these income statement line items must be adjusted, in part, by reserve amortization to earn the targeted regulatory ROE. In certain periods, reserve amortization is reversed so as not to exceed the targeted regulatory ROE. The drivers of the FPL segment's net income not reflected in the reserve amortization calculation typically include wholesale and transmission service revenues  and  expenses,  cost  recovery  clause  revenues  and  expenses, AFUDC  -  equity  and  revenue  and  costs  not  recoverable  from  retail customers.  In  2021  and  2020,  the  FPL  segment  recorded  reserve  amortization  of  approximately  $429  million  and  the  reversal  of  reserve amortization of $1 million, respectively. The FPL segment's regulatory ROE for both 2021 and 2020 was approximately 11.60%.\n\nIn December 2021, the FPSC issued a final order approving the 2021 rate agreement which became effective in January 2022 and will remain in effect until at least December 2025, establishes FPL's allowed regulatory ROE at 10.60%, with a range of 9.70% to 11.70%, and allows for retail rate base increases in 2022 and 2023. In December 2021, Floridians Against Increased Rates, Inc. and, as a group in January 2022, Florida Rising, Inc., Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida, Inc., and League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida filed notices of appeal challenging the FPSC's final order approving the 2021 rate agreement, which notices of appeal are pending before the Florida Supreme Court. See Item 1. Business - FPL - FPL Regulation - FPL Electric Rate Regulation - Base Rates - Base Rates Effective January 2022 through December 2025 for additional information on the 2021 rate agreement.\n\nDuring 2021, operating revenues increased $938 million primarily related to higher fuel cost recovery revenues as discussed in cost recovery clauses below.",

Reserve amortization, or reversal of such amortization, reflects adjustments to accrued asset removal costs provided under the 2021 rate agreement in order to achieve the targeted regulatory ROE. Reserve amortization is recorded as either an increase or decrease to accrued asset removal costs which is reflected in noncurrent regulatory assets on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets.

      "answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power guaranteed a $100 million principal amount long-term bank loan entered into by SEGCO, with Georgia Power agreeing to reimburse Alabama Power for its proportionate ownership share if the guarantee was called. This intercompany arrangement created a contingent liability that flowed through to Southern Company's consolidated financial position. By 2024, the filings showed that Georgia Power remained operationally and legally connected to Southern Company through formal governance mechanisms like powers of attorney, indicating that Georgia Power's financial obligations\u2014including its reimbursement commitment to Alabama Power\u2014continued to directly impact Southern Company's consolidated risk exposure. Thus, the 2023 guarantee and Georgia Power's obligation to reimburse created a financial linkage that remained relevant to Southern Company's stake in Georgia Power in 2024.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's liability exposure through Georgia Power evolve from 2023 assessments to 2024 pension obligations, particularly in terms of the $89 million NEIL-related assessment in 2023 and the $106 million increase in projected pension obligations under Georgia Power in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power faced a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies, reflecting potential liabilities tied to insurance frameworks and operational risks. By 2024, Georgia Power\u2019s financial exposure shifted focus to pension obligations, with a $106 million increase in projected pension obligations at year-end, indicating a material evolution in Southern Company\u2019s liability profile. This shift highlights a transition from short-term insurance-related liabilities to long-term benefit obligations, signaling a strategic or regulatory-driven change in risk exposure for Georgia Power within Southern Company\u2019s broader financial structure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company disclosed Alabama Power's generation and purchased power structure, which included regulatory mechanisms allowing for adjustments in billing related to tax flowbacks. In 2023, Alabama Power provided customer bill credits tied to the flowback of excess accumulated deferred income taxes. These credits directly contributed to a $816 million increase in operating cash flow in 2024, as noted in SO's 2024 MD&A section, driven by the timing and recognition of these credits within the regulatory framework established in prior years.",

The increase in rates and pricing was primarily due to the inclusion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 in retail rates net of the elimination of the NCCR tariff at G eorgia Power, customer bill credits in 2023 at Alabama Power related to the flowback of certain excess accumulated deferred income taxes, base tariff increases at Georgia Power in accordance with the 2022 ARP, higher contributions from commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing at Georgia Power, and an increase in Rate CNP New Plant revenues at Alabama Power.\n\nElectric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power\" and \"Georgia Power\" for additional information.

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy reported a prefunded post-retirement benefit of $8 million for the company as a whole, with the Carolinas Segment showing no prefunded amount. By 2024, the Carolinas Segment had a prefunded post-retirement benefit of $61 million, reflecting a significant increase in allocation. This change coincided with the Carolinas Segment transitioning from a net liability of $35 million in 2022 to a net asset of $33 million in 2024. Additionally, the Carolinas Segment's intangible assets, net, stood at $97 million in 2024, indicating a stronger financial position.

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny over the cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including audits, legal inquiries, and oversight from the Georgia Public Service Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This scrutiny likely contributed to Georgia Power's regulatory assets/liabilities position, which showed a net liability of $64 million in 2024 compared to a liability of $74 million in 2023. The reduction in liability by $10 million suggests some resolution or progress in regulatory treatment of these costs over time, although the continued net liability indicates ongoing challenges in fully recovering customer credits.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company faced significant exposure to financial statement uncertainties through Georgia Power related to the completion and cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Deloitte conducting extensive audit procedures to assess disclosures around construction status, cost forecasts, and regulatory challenges. By 2023, this risk had evolved into a more defined liability structure through Alabama Power, which faced a maximum annual NEIL policy assessment of $54 million\u2014lower than Georgia Power\u2019s $89 million\u2014indicating a shift in risk distribution across subsidiaries. The intercompany reimbursement agreement between Georgia Power and Alabama Power for the SEGCO loan guarantee also introduced cross-segment financial dependencies that could amplify risk transmission under joint liability frameworks.",

      "question": "How did the potential NEIL policy assessment risk exposure disclosed for Georgia Power in 2023 compare to its 2024 total retail electric revenues, and what does this imply about the company's risk management strategy relative to its revenue base?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power faced a potential NEIL policy assessment risk of up to $89 million (Chunk 1), which could have had a material effect on its financial condition. In 2023, Georgia Power's total retail electric revenues were $9,049 million (Chunk 2), increasing to $9,378 million in 2024 (Chunk 3). This implies that while Georgia Power's revenue base grew slightly (by $329 million or ~3.6%), the NEIL assessment risk remained static at $89 million. This suggests that Georgia Power's risk management strategy did not involve reducing its exposure to NEIL-related liabilities despite the growth in its revenue base, indicating a stable appetite for insurance-related risk.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Georgia Power: Discloses potential NEIL policy assessment risk of $89 million for Georgia Power.",

      "question": "How did the prefunded post-retirement benefit for the Piedmont segment change from $12 million in 2023 to $14 million in 2024, and what does this indicate about Duke Energy's funding strategy for post-retirement obligations within this segment over time?",
      "answer": "The prefunded post-retirement benefit for the Piedmont segment increased from $12 million in 2023 to $14 million in 2024, indicating a more proactive funding strategy by Duke Energy to address post-retirement obligations. In 2023, the segment reported a prefunded post-retirement benefit of $12 million, with no current or noncurrent liabilities disclosed for that segment. By 2024, the prefunded amount rose to $14 million, while the segment still showed no post-retirement liabilities. This suggests Duke Energy increased its prefunding in the Piedmont segment year-over-year, potentially aiming to reduce future financial exposure related to retirement benefits.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny over the uncertainties in cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, prompting detailed audits and disclosures. By 2023, Southern Company Gas maintained long-term gas transportation agreements under FERC regulation, with transportation costs reported at $112 million for the year. These agreements, governed by SNG's tariff, suggest a strategic alignment with Georgia Power's energy needs despite earlier nuclear project risks. Southern Company Gas also disclosed multi-year benefit payments, including $17 million in 2024, indicating continued financial planning influenced by inter-segment energy dependencies.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant scrutiny and uncertainty regarding the completion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with auditors noting risks to cost recovery due to construction delays and regulatory challenges. By 2024, Georgia Power had completed approximately $1.1 billion in construction related to these units, and this progress was partially offset by customer bill credits issued in 2023. The shift from uncertainty in 2022 to substantial completion in 2024 suggests that Southern Company was able to stabilize its cost recovery position, enabling strategic use of bill credits to manage customer impacts. This reflects a broader evolution in Southern Company's financial strategy, where major infrastructure investments are increasingly tied to customer-facing financial adjustments.",

The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments and net repayments of short-term bank debt and commercial paper, partially offset by net issuances of long-term debt and issuances of common stock.\n\n## Alabama Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities increased $311 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with a Rate RSE adjustment effective in January 2021 and higher customer usage, as well as the timing of fossil fuel stock purchases and receivable collections, partially offset by decreased fuel cost recovery.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to gross property additions.\n\nThe net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to capital contributions from Southern Company and net long-term debt issuances, partially offset by common stock dividend payments.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities decreased $37 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to decreased fuel cost recovery, partially offset by the timing of customer receivable collections and vendor payments and customer bill credits issued in 2020 associated with Tax Reform and 2018 and 2019 earnings in excess of the allowed retail ROE range.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to gross property additions, including approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, related to the construction of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4.

      "question": "How did the change in Duke Energy Ohio's segment financials from 2022 to 2023 influence the company's noncurrent pension liability, and what does this indicate about the long-term liability management in that segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Ohio reported a noncurrent pension liability of $88 million, reflecting the segment's pension obligations. By 2023, this liability decreased to $72 million, indicating an improvement in liability management. This reduction in the noncurrent pension liability from $88 million to $72 million suggests that Duke Energy Ohio likely made strategic pension contributions or experienced favorable actuarial adjustments over the year. The connection between the Ohio segment and the noncurrent pension liability highlights how segment-level financial activities directly influence the company's broader pension obligations, and the reduction implies better alignment of pension assets with liabilities in the Ohio region.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant uncertainties related to the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, prompting extensive auditing procedures by Deloitte to assess financial disclosures and potential risks. By 2024, Southern Company disclosed $2,009 million in obligations under the BB+ and/or Ba1 or below rating category, with Georgia Power alone accounting for $789 million. This indicates that the financial exposure tied to lower-rated obligations increased over time, potentially reflecting the lingering impact of the Plant Vogtle project's uncertainties on Georgia Power's credit profile and, consequently, Southern Company's consolidated risk position.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's current post-retirement liability for the Ohio segment evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this indicate about the company's short-term obligations related to post-retirement benefits?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Ohio reported a current post-retirement liability of $1 million, as disclosed in the 2023 segment data. This figure remained unchanged at $1 million in 2024, indicating stability in the short-term post-retirement obligations for that segment. Additionally, in 2024, Duke Energy Ohio reported $14 million in regulatory liabilities, which may reflect longer-term obligations or commitments. The consistency in the current liability suggests no major adjustments in the segment's immediate post-retirement funding requirements over the two years.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2023) \u2192 Ohio Segment: In 2023, Duke Energy Ohio had a current post-retirement liability of $1 million.",

        "Hop 3: Current Post-Retirement Liability \u2190 DUK(2024): In 2024, the current liability remained at $1 million, with $14 million in regulatory liabilities indicating broader obligations."

The majority of the Registrants' fuel expense for the periods presented was purchased under long-term commitments. Each Registrant expects that a substantial amount of its future fuel needs will continue to be purchased under long-term commitments.\n\nGeorgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required whether or not any capacity is available. Portions of the capacity payments made to MEAG Power for its Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 investment relate to costs in excess of Georgia Power's allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these portions at the time of the disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity is included in purchased power in Southern Company's statements of income and in purchased power, non-affiliates in Georgia Power's statements of income. Georgia Power's capacity payments related to this commitment totaled $6 million, $5 million, and $6 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, Georgia Power's estimated long-term obligations related to this commitment totaled $42 million, consisting of $4 million for 2022, $3 million annually for 2023 through 2025, $1 million for 2026, and $28 million thereafter.\n\nSee Note 9 for information regarding PPAs accounted for as leases.\n\nSouthern Company Gas has commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply, including charges recoverable through natural gas cost recovery mechanisms or, alternatively, billed to marketers selling retail natural gas. Gas supply commitments include amounts for gas commodity purchases associated with Nicor Gas and SouthStar of 56 million mmBtu at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2021 and valued at $222 million. Southern Company Gas provides guarantees to certain gas suppliers for certain of its subsidiaries in support of payment obligations. Southern Company Gas' expected future contractual obligations for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply that are not recognized on the balance sheets at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the Alabama PSC's July 2022 modifications to Alabama Power's Rate NDR charge structure impact the company's 2023 storm reserve balances and customer billing limits, particularly in relation to the suspension of the reserve establishment charge when balances exceeded $75 million?",
      "answer": "The Alabama PSC's July 2022 modifications to the Rate NDR charge structure had a measurable impact on Alabama Power's 2023 financials. The maximum Rate NDR charge was reduced from $10 per month per non-residential account and $5 per residential account to $5 and $2.50, respectively. This change, along with the suspension of the reserve establishment charge once the NDR balance exceeded $75 million in August 2022, led to a shift in how reserves were maintained. In 2023, Alabama Power collected approximately $12 million under Rate NDR, compared to $14 million in 2022. By December 31, 2023, the NDR balance stood at $76 million, down from $97 million in 2022, indicating a slower accumulation of reserves under the new structure. Despite this, Alabama Power expected to collect approximately $12 million annually under Rate NDR unless the balance fell below $50 million.",

By 2023, this volume dropped to 3 million mmBtu for Alabama Power, with Southern Company's total exposure declining to 12 million mmBtu. This reduction likely contributed to a more streamlined hedging strategy, as evidenced by the pre-tax loss estimate of $(37) million for Southern Company in 2024, compared to 'immaterial' expected reclassifications in 2022, indicating a more defined risk exposure profile.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas disclosed a longest hedge date of 2027 for natural gas, indicating a strategic extension of risk management commitments. By 2024, this extended exposure was accompanied by specific cash collateral management practices, including $17 million held in broker margin accounts at year-end. The 2023 disclosures on regulatory hedge accounting and derivative settlement practices provide context for how these long-term hedging strategies were operationalized through collateral requirements in the following year.",

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts.

      "question": "How did Southern Company's disclosures about Georgia Power's decommissioning obligations for Plant Hatch evolve between 2022 and 2023, and what does this reveal about their ARO (Asset Retirement Obligation) management strategy for nuclear assets?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company, through its auditor Deloitte, was actively scrutinizing Georgia Power\u2019s disclosures regarding uncertainties in cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including inquiries into construction status, legal risks, and regulatory challenges. This reflects an emphasis on forward-looking financial risks tied to nuclear construction. By 2023, the disclosures shifted focus to Georgia Power's existing nuclear decommissioning obligations, including those tied to Plant Hatch, which were now being capitalized and depreciated as part of long-lived assets. The 2023 financial statements explicitly mention Plant Hatch in the context of AROs (Asset Retirement Obligations), indicating a transition from risk monitoring during construction to formal liability recognition in operations. This evolution suggests a strategic shift in financial reporting from risk mitigation during project execution to structured liability management in the post-operational planning phase for nuclear assets.",

      "question": "How did Alabama Power's projected pension obligation increase of $89 million disclosed in SO's 2024 filing impact Southern Company's consolidated financial exposure compared to the 2022 disclosure, and what does this reveal about the company's long-term liability management?",
      "answer": "In SO's 2022 filing, Alabama Power was disclosed as a segment of Southern Company, establishing its inclusion in the consolidated financial statements. By 2024, the filing revealed that Alabama Power's projected pension obligation increased by $89 million as of December 31, 2024, due to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate. Since Alabama Power is a subsidiary, this increase directly affected Southern Company's consolidated projected obligation for pension plans, raising the total obligation by $89 million. This indicates that Southern Company's consolidated liabilities are sensitive to pension obligation changes at the subsidiary level, and it highlights the long-term financial exposure the company faces in managing these pension liabilities across its segments.",

        "Hop 1: [SO](2022) \u2192 [Alabama Power]: Discloses Alabama Power as a subsidiary segment, making its financials part of Southern Company's consolidated statements.",

        "Hop 3: [Projected Obligation for Pension Plan] \u2190 [SO](2024): The $89 million increase in Alabama Power's pension obligation contributes to Southern Company's consolidated projected pension obligation, directly affecting the company's total long-term liabilities."

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant uncertainties regarding the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as noted in the audit disclosures, which included regulatory scrutiny and potential legal challenges. These uncertainties likely influenced cautious financial practices, including the timing of customer receivable collections, as seen in the 2021 comparison where receivables were partially offset by customer bill credits. By 2024, with the completion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with $0.2 billion invested in 2024 versus $1.1 billion in 2023), Georgia Power experienced a $2.0 billion increase in operating cash flow, partly due to improved fuel cost recovery and vendor payment timing, but also negatively impacted by the timing of customer receivable collections. This suggests that the resolution of Plant Vogtle uncertainties led to improved cash flow dynamics but introduced new timing shifts in receivables, reflecting a strategic adjustment in collection practices post-completion.",

See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power\" for additional information.\n\nThe net cash used for financing activities in 2024 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments, partially offset by capital contributions from Southern Company. The net cash used for financing activities in 2023 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments, largely offset by net issuances of long-term debt and capital contributions from Southern Company.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities increased $2.0 billion in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments, increased fuel cost recovery, and fossil fuel stock purchases, partially offset by storm restoration costs and the timing of customer receivable collections.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to gross property additions, including approximately $0.2 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively, related to the construction and completion of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information on construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n\nThe net cash provided from financing activities in 2024 was primarily related to capital contributions from Southern Company and net issuances of senior notes, partially offset by common stock dividend payments, a reduction in commercial paper borrowings, and a net decrease in short-term borrowings. The net cash provided from financing activities in 2023 was primarily related to capital contributions from Southern Company, net issuances of senior notes, an increase in commercial paper borrowings, and reofferings of pollution control revenue bonds which were previously held by Georgia Power, partially offset by common stock dividend payments and a net decrease in short-term borrowings.\n\n## Mississippi Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities increased $37 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to the timing of vendor payments and increased retail fuel cost recovery, partially offset by the timing of customer receivable collections.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2024 and 2023 was primarily related to gross property additions.\n\nThe net cash used for financing activities in 2024 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments, partially offset by capital contributions from Southern Company and net issuances of senior notes. The net cash used for financing activities in 2023 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments, partially offset by the issuance of senior notes.\n\n## Southern Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities decreased $388 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to the utilization of federal tax  credit carryforwards and the timing of customer receivable collections, partially offset by the timing of vendor payments.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2024 was primarily related to ongoing construction activities. The net cash used for investing activities in 2023 was primarily related to the acquisitions of the South Cheyenne and Millers Branch solar facilities and ongoing construction activities. See Note 15 to the financial statements under \"Southern Power\" for additional information.\n\nThe net cash used for financing activities in 2024 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments, net distributions to noncontrolling interests, and a reduction in commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by capital contributions from Southern Company. The net cash used for financing activities in 2023 was primarily related to the repayment of senior notes at maturity, common stock dividend payments, net distributions to noncontrolling interests, and net repayments of short-term debt.\n\n## Southern Company Gas\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities decreased $210 million in 2024 as compared to 2023 primarily due to a reduction in natural gas cost recovery as well as a decrease in receivables, partially offset by a decrease in payables for natural gas, both as a result of significantly lower gas prices in 2024 and weather impacts.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company faced significant regulatory scrutiny over Georgia Power's construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with concerns about cost recovery and financial disclosures. Georgia Power reported $30 million in deferred regulatory assets in 2021 (as seen in SO_10k_2022.pdf), indicating early-stage regulatory cost deferrals. By 2024, Southern Company's deferred regulatory assets had increased to $1,815 million, showing a substantial rise from $1,858 million in 2023. This suggests that the earlier regulatory challenges and cost recovery uncertainties likely contributed to a more pronounced deferral of regulatory costs over time, as the company continued to seek regulatory relief and adjustments.",

      "question": "How did the change in Southern Company's Net Regulatory Assets from 2023 to 2024 impact Georgia Power's regulatory asset amortization, given Southern Company's continued stake in Georgia Power?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company reported Net Regulatory Assets of $208 million (with Georgia Power accounting for $74 million), and by 2024, this balance decreased to $189 million (with Georgia Power at $64 million). This $19 million net decrease in total regulatory assets included $10 million in amortization of regulatory assets for Southern Company Gas. Georgia Power specifically saw a $10 million change in its regulatory asset balance from 2023 to 2024, driven in part by $5 million in amortization of net gain and $1 million in amortization of prior service costs. Southern Company's continued stake in Georgia Power, confirmed in 2024 through the Power of Attorney and resolution documentation, meant that Georgia Power's regulatory asset amortization directly influenced the consolidated Net Regulatory Assets of the parent company.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Net Regulatory Assets: Southern Company reported $208 million in Net Regulatory Assets at year-end 2023, with Georgia Power accounting for $74 million of that total.",

        "Hop 3: Georgia Power \u2190 SO(2024): Southern Company maintained its stake in Georgia Power in 2024, as evidenced by the Power of Attorney and resolution documentation, ensuring Georgia Power's financials continued to influence Southern Company's consolidated regulatory assets."

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company faced potential financial exposure through Alabama Power due to the unresolved $75 million holdback from the Gulf Power sale, tied to the Plant Daniel operating agreement. This uncertainty could have impacted Alabama Power's financial condition due to its operational responsibility for the plant. By 2024, the revised operating agreement was finalized in July 2022 (as reported in the 2024 filing), and the $75 million holdback was released to Southern Company, reducing financial risk. Additionally, Alabama Power continued to operate Plant Daniel jointly with Mississippi Power, with its proportionate share of operating expenses included in its income statement, indicating a stable operational structure but with clarified financial exposure.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company classified Georgia Power's $4.8 billion in FFB Credit Facility borrowings as long-term debt, while Alabama Power's $200 million Series 2023A Floating Rate Senior Notes due in 2073 were classified as 'securities due within one year' due to holder repayment options beginning in 2024. By 2024, Georgia Power itself had $117 million in Series 2024C Floating Rate Senior Notes due in 2074 classified as 'securities due within one year' because repayment options began in 2025, while its FFB borrowings decreased to $4.7 billion.

As a result, the senior notes are classified as securities due w ithin one year on the balance sheets of S outhern Company and Alabama Pow er at December 31, 2024.\n\n(c) Amounts include principal amortization related to the FFB borrow ings; how ever, the final maturity date is February 20, 2044. S ee \"DOE Loan G uarantee Borrow ings\" herein for additional information. G eorgia Pow er's 2025 maturities include approximately $117 million aggregate principal amount of S eries 2024C Floating Rate S enior Notes due November 15, 2074 that are repayable at the option of the holders at certain dates beginning in 2025. As a result, the senior notes are classified as securities due w ithin one year on the balance sheets of Southern Company and G eorgia Pow er at December 31, 2024.\n\n(d) Southern Pow er's 2026 maturities include $564 million of euro-denominated debt at the U.S . dollar-denominated hedge settlement amount.\n\n## DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings\n\nPursuant to the loan guarantee program established under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program), Georgia Power and the DOE entered into a loan guarantee agreement in 2014 and the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement in 2019. Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee the obligations of Georgia Power under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, Georgia Power was authorized to make term loan borrowings through the FFB in an amount up to approximately $5.130 billion.\n\nIn 2021, Georgia Power made the final borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities and no further borrowings are permitted. During 2024, Georgia Power made principal amortization payments of $86 million under the FFB Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Georgia Power had $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the FFB Credit Facilities, respectively.\n\nAll borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities are full recourse to Georgia Power, and Georgia Power is obligated to reimburse the DOE for any payments the DOE is required to make to the FFB under its guarantee. Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE are secured by a first priority lien on (i) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (primarily the units, the related real property, and any nuclear fuel loaded in the reactor core) and (ii) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. There are no restrictions on Georgia Power's ability to grant liens on other property.\n\nThe final maturity date for each advance under the FFB Credit Facilities is February 20, 2044. Interest is payable quarterly and principal payments began in 2020. Each borrowing under the FFB Credit Facilities bears interest at a fix ed rate equal to the applicable U.S. Treasury rate at the time of the borrowing plus a spread equal to 0.375%.\n\nUnder the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, Georgia Power is subject to customary borrower affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, G eorgia Power is subject to project-related reporting requirements and other project-specific covenants and events of default.\n\nIn the event certain mandatory prepayment events occur, Georgia Power will be required to prepay the outstanding principal amount of all borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years (with level principal amortization). Among other things, these mandatory prepayment events include (i) loss of necessary governmental approvals for operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) loss of regulation by the Georgia PSC; (iii) cost disallowances by the Georgia PSC that could have a material adverse effect on Georgia Power's ability to repay the outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities; (iv) certain material casualty losses or a governmental taking of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; or (v) loss of access to the intellectual property rights necessary to operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Under certain circumstances, insurance proceeds and any proceeds from an event of taking must be applied to immediately prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. G eorgia Power also may voluntarily prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, any prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) will be made with a make-whole premium or discount, as applicable.\n\nSee Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.",

      "question": "What does the change in Piedmont's performance obligations from 2022 to 2024 suggest about Duke Energy's asset retirement liability management strategy, particularly given the shift from $592 million in total obligations for Piedmont in 2022 to just $29 million in noncurrent liabilities by the end of 2024?",
      "answer": "The significant reduction in Piedmont's reported obligations\u2014from $592 million in remaining performance obligations in 2022 to just $29 million in total asset retirement obligations by the end of 2024\u2014suggests a strategic or accounting shift in how Duke Energy is managing or reporting liabilities associated with the Piedmont segment. This could indicate either a substantial reduction in long-term retirement obligations, a reclassification of these liabilities, or a consolidation change in segment reporting. Given that the Total Noncurrent Asset Retirement Obligation for Duke Energy as a whole remained substantial at $9.342 billion in 2024, the drop in Piedmont's reported share may reflect a reallocation of liabilities to other segments or a strategic decision to externalize or defer certain obligations previously attributed to Piedmont.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 Piedmont: In 2022, Duke Energy reported $592 million in remaining performance obligations attributed to the Piedmont segment.",
        "Hop 2: Piedmont \u2192 Total Noncurrent Asset Retirement Obligation: By 2024, Piedmont's contribution to this liability category dropped to just $29 million, suggesting a material change in how the segment's obligations were accounted for or managed.",
        "Hop 3: Total Noncurrent Asset Retirement Obligation \u2190 DUK(2024): Despite the drop in Piedmont's reported liability, the company's total noncurrent asset retirement obligation remained high at $9.342 billion, indicating that the liability was not eliminated but likely shifted or restructured."

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's Carolinas segment held $25 million in noncurrent post-retirement liabilities, indicating a notable long-term obligation tied to retiree benefits. By 2024, this figure dropped to $0, suggesting a strategic restructuring or funding shift in how the company manages these liabilities. This change implies that Duke Energy may have taken steps to prefund or otherwise mitigate long-term post-retirement obligations specifically within the Carolinas segment, reducing its dependency on deferred liabilities. The broader Duke Energy group saw a decrease in noncurrent post-retirement liabilities from $179 million in 2023 to $165 million in 2024, aligning with this trend.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power had a maximum annual assessment of $54 million under NEIL policies related to nuclear insurance liabilities, which could have a material effect on Southern Company's financial condition. By 2024, Southern Company began amortizing Software and Cloud Computing Costs, with Alabama Power specifically amortizing $76 million of these costs over the life of the related software, which could last up to 10 years (through 2034). This indicates a strategic shift towards digital transformation while managing existing nuclear-related financial exposures.",

      "question": "How does Alabama Power's 2024 derivative liability disclosure reflect the execution of their hedging strategy originally outlined in the 2022 filing?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power disclosed their 'Longest Hedge Date' as 2024, indicating that their hedging strategy at that time extended forward to manage risk through that year [Chunk 1]. By 2024, Alabama Power reported $23 million in current derivative liabilities and $12 million in non-current liabilities under hedging instruments for regulatory purposes, showing that hedging activities were actively maintained [Chunk 3]. The connection between the 2024 liabilities and the 2022 hedge horizon suggests that Alabama Power executed or at least maintained hedging instruments consistent with the strategy outlined in 2022, with liabilities reflecting the financial commitments of those instruments [Chunk 2]. However, the absence of updated hedge date disclosures in 2024 limits the ability to assess forward-looking extensions beyond the original 2024 horizon.",

      "question": "How did the projected pension obligation for Georgia Power change from 2022 to 2024, and what does this indicate about Southern Company's long-term liability exposure through its stake in Georgia Power?",
      "answer": "In 2022, a 25 basis point change in the discount rate resulted in a $180 million increase (or $170 million decrease) in the projected pension obligation for Georgia Power, while in 2024, the same change led to a $106 million increase (or $101 million decrease). This indicates a reduction in Southern Company's long-term liability exposure through its stake in Georgia Power, as the magnitude of pension obligation sensitivity to discount rate fluctuations has decreased over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Projected Obligation for Pension Plan: Southern Company disclosed a $180 million increase (or $170 million decrease) in Georgia Power's pension obligation due to a 25 basis point change in discount rate.",
        "Hop 2: Projected Obligation for Pension Plan \u2192 Georgia Power: The pension obligation is directly tied to Georgia Power's workforce and retirement benefits structure.",
        "Hop 3: Georgia Power \u2190 SO(2024): Southern Company maintains a controlling stake in Georgia Power, making changes in its pension obligations directly relevant to SO's consolidated liability exposure."

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Florida had an intercompany income tax payable of $114 million and a disclosed current post-retirement liability of $2 million. By 2024, the intercompany income tax payable for Florida decreased to $113 million (implied from total company payable of $486 million and other segments' values), while the current post-retirement liability remained flat at $2 million. The slight reduction in the Florida segment's tax payable, combined with the stability of its post-retirement liability, suggests minimal direct financial impact from this segment on the overall liability position. However, the company-wide current post-retirement liability decreased from $8 million in 2023 to $8 million in 2024, indicating that while Florida's contribution remained stable, other segments like Duke Energy Carolinas and Progress Energy saw reductions that drove the overall decline.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Piedmont had no recorded liabilities for ash impoundment closures, as shown in the 2021 year-end data from DUK's 2022 10-K filing. By 2023, Piedmont was included in the broader liability planning for post-retirement benefits, with a six-year average remaining service period explicitly mentioned in the 2023 filing. This indicates a strategic shift toward consolidated liability management across all subsidiaries, including Piedmont, even though ash closure obligations themselves remained unspecified for Piedmont in the 2023 disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 Ash Closure: In 2022, the company disclosed $5,293 million in ash impoundment closure obligations, with no amount attributed to Piedmont.",
        "Hop 2: Ash Closure \u2192 Piedmont: The 2022 filing explicitly showed zero liability for Piedmont in ash closure obligations, indicating it was not included in the asset retirement planning at that time.",
        "Hop 3: Piedmont \u2190 DUK(2023): In 2023, Piedmont was explicitly included in the company's liability planning, with a six-year average remaining service period mentioned for post-retirement benefits accounting."

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant scrutiny over the financial disclosures related to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including regulatory, legal, and construction risks that could impact cost recovery. These uncertainties were monitored through audits, regulatory filings, and NRC inspections. By 2023, this concern translated into a substantial increase in 'Other deferred credits and liabilities,' rising from $42 million in 2022 to $196 million in 2023. This increase indicates a materialization of earlier-identified risks, with Georgia Power recognizing deferred liabilities tied to the ongoing financial and regulatory challenges of the Vogtle expansion. The connection between the initial risk disclosures in 2022 and the deferred liability growth in 2023 shows a clear temporal evolution of financial exposure tied to the project.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's energy revenues relate to energy demand changes between 2023 and 2024, especially considering the $884 million drop in energy revenues at Southern Power in 2023 and the 23.1% increase in natural gas generation volume in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Power experienced an $884 million decrease in energy revenues primarily due to falling fuel and purchased power prices, along with a net decline in the volume of KWHs sold under natural gas PPAs. This reflects how energy revenues were negatively impacted by both pricing and reduced demand or generation availability. In 2024, although energy revenues continued to decline by $13 million at Southern Power due to lower fuel prices, this was partially offset by a 23.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, indicating a strategic shift toward greater utilization of natural gas generation. The relationship between energy revenues and demand evolved as Southern Company responded to lower prices by increasing generation volume, particularly through natural gas, to stabilize revenue streams despite the ongoing sensitivity of energy revenues to fuel costs and demand fluctuations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Energy Revenues: Southern Power saw a significant $884 million drop in energy revenues, driven by lower fuel prices and reduced KWH volumes sold under natural gas PPAs.",
        "Hop 2: Energy Revenues \u2192 Demand for Energy: Energy revenues are directly influenced by demand within Southern Company\u2019s service territory, as well as generation availability and fuel prices.",
        "Hop 3: Demand for Energy \u2190 SO(2024): In 2024, despite continued pressure on energy prices, Southern Company increased natural gas generation by 23.1%, reflecting a shift in generation mix to meet demand more cost-effectively."

Energy revenues decreased $45 million at the traditional electric operating companies and $13 million at Southern Power primarily due to fuel and purchased power price decreases compared to 2023. Partially offsetting the Southern Power decrease was an increase in the volume of KWHs sold primarily under natural gas and solar PPAs. The increase in capacity revenues was primarily due to a net increase in revenues from capacity contracts at Georgia Power and an increase in capacity revenues associated with natural gas PPAs at Southern Power. The changes in capacity and energy revenues also reflect decreases resulting from power sales agreements that ended in 2023 at Alabama Power and Mississippi Power.\n\nWholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fix ed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the",

The decrease was primarily due to a $54 million net decrease related to the average cost of fuel and purchased power and a $17 million net decrease related to the volume of KWHs generated and purchased.\n\nFuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Alabama Power's energy cost recovery clause. Alabama Power, along with the Alabama PSC, continuously monitors the under/over recovered balance to determine whether adjustments to billing rates are required. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate ECR\" for additional information.\n\n## Fuel\n\nFuel expense was $1.4 billion in 2024, an increase of $59 million, or 4.5%, compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to a 23.1% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas, an 8.4% increase in the volume of KWHs generated by coal, and a 9.6% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by hydro facilities as a result of less rainfall, partially offset by an 8.7% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by natural gas, which ex cludes tolling agreements, and a 7.8% decrease in the average cost per KWH generated by coal.\n\n## Purchased Power -Non-Affiliates\n\nPurchased power expense from non-affiliates was $199 million in 2024, a decrease of $54 million, or 21.3%, compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 31.3% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased as a result of a PPA that ended in May 2023 and the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama Generating Station generation, partially offset by a 12.5% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased.\n\nEnergy purchases from non-affiliates will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation.\n\n## Purchased Power -Affiliates\n\nPurchased power expense from affiliates was $175 million in 2024, a decrease of $76 million, or 30.3%, compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a 42.4% decrease in the volume of KWHs purchased due to the availability of Plant Barry Unit 8 and Central Alabama Generating Station generation and a reduction in capacity-related expenses due to lower capacity needs in 2024, partially offset by a 21.0% increase in the average cost per KWH purchased.\n\nEnergy purchases from affiliates will vary depending on demand for energy and the availability and cost of generating resources at each company within the Southern Company system.

This joint ownership meant Georgia Power was jointly and severally liable for third-party claims related to the plant. By 2023, Georgia Power's maximum potential annual assessment under NEIL insurance policies had risen to $89 million, reflecting increased liability exposure tied to its involvement in multiple jointly-owned plants, including Scherer. The interconnected ownership structure and shared liability obligations meant that Georgia Power's risk exposure in 2023 was directly influenced by its 2022 stake in Scherer, as it remained subject to assessments for losses exceeding insurer funds.",

      "answer": "The allocation of interest expense from NEECH to NextEra Energy Resources remained based on a 70% debt capital structure in both 2022 and 2024, as explicitly stated in the filings. In 2024, however, NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) reported that changes in the fair value of non-qualifying hedge derivative instruments were marked to market and recognized directly in earnings, resulting in volatility. This contrasts with the 2022 context, where the allocation mechanism was described but no specific mention was made of the mark-to-market volatility impact. The 2024 disclosure highlights that NEER's results included significant unrealized gains or losses from non-qualifying hedges, which were not offset by corresponding changes in physical asset valuations under GAAP, thereby increasing earnings volatility.",

The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.\n\nAt FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\nIn NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE estimates the fair v alue of these deriv ativ es using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs.\n\nCertain derivative transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing  adjusted  earnings  and  could  be  significant  to  NEER's  results  because  the  economic  offset  to  the  positions  are  not  marked  to  market. A s  a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP . For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy M arketing and Trading and M arket Risk Sensitivity.\n\n## Accounting for Pension Benefits\n\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. M anagement believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nFor the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial calculations based on the plan's provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in Alabama Power's pension plan prior service cost liability from 2023 to 2024 reflect changes in Southern Company's broader pension obligations, and what does this suggest about their pension funding strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power reported a prior service cost liability of $4 million, which decreased to $3 million by the end of 2024. This reduction mirrored a broader trend within Southern Company, where the consolidated prior service cost liability dropped from $13 million in 2023 to $11 million in 2024. The decline in liability suggests that Southern Company may have implemented a more aggressive pension funding strategy across its subsidiaries, including Alabama Power, potentially through increased contributions or actuarial adjustments. This trend indicates a strategic move to reduce long-term pension liabilities on the balance sheet.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Alabama Power: Southern Company's 2023 financial statements included Alabama Power's pension liabilities, showing a prior service cost of $4 million.",
        "Hop 2: Alabama Power \u2192 Prior Service Cost - Pension Plan: Alabama Power's portion of the pension liability is explicitly disclosed in the regulatory assets and liabilities section of the financial statements.",
        "Hop 3: Prior Service Cost - Pension Plan \u2190 SO(2024): By 2024, the consolidated prior service cost for Southern Company decreased to $11 million, with Alabama Power's share dropping to $3 million."

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to joint ownership risk through Alabama Power and Georgia Power evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in relation to SEGCO's operations and liability assessments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company's exposure to joint ownership risk was evident through Alabama Power and Georgia Power's equal ownership of SEGCO, which included $1,020 MWs of generating capacity and associated transmission facilities. Both entities made payments to SEGCO for operating expenses, taxes, interest, and a ROE, with Alabama Power paying $112 million and Georgia Power paying $115 million in 2023 alone. SEGCO also paid $25 million in dividends, split equally between the two entities. In 2024, Georgia Power retained legal authority through a power of attorney, indicating continued active involvement in SEGCO's governance. However, the retirement of SEGCO's generating units is expected by 2028, and Alabama Power is evaluating with Georgia Power the extension of Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 beyond that date, suggesting a potential increase in liability exposure if operations are extended. This evolution shows a transition from stable joint ownership in 2023 to a more uncertain risk profile in 2024 as operational decisions loom.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas reported $195 million in deferred regulatory assets related to under-recovered environmental remediation costs, while its accrued environmental remediation liability stood at $192 million. By 2024, the deferred regulatory assets increased slightly to $201 million, and the accrued liability also rose to $198 million. This indicates a parallel increase in both the liability and the regulatory asset, suggesting that the company continued to defer additional costs related to environmental remediation that were not yet recovered through rates. The slight growth in both figures shows a consistent regulatory treatment of these liabilities across the two years.",

      "answer": "The reduction in Southern Company Gas' net purchased mmBtu volumes from 102 in 2023 to 83 in 2024 did not result in a proportional decrease in derivative collateral requirements. Despite the 19-point drop in physical gas volumes, Southern Company Gas still maintained $17 million in cash collateral held in broker margin accounts at year-end 2024. This suggests that while physical gas purchasing activity decreased, the company's exposure to financial derivatives\u2014and the associated margin requirements\u2014remained significant, potentially due to continued hedging activities or market volatility.

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $17 million.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&amp;P, or Fitch or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit ex posure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their ex posure to counterparty credit risk.\n\nSouthern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investmentgrade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's disclosures focused on Alabama Power's generation asset amortization, including details about long-lived assets. By 2024, the company expanded its reporting to include structured amortization periods for retiree benefit plans, specifically noting a maximum 14-year amortization horizon aligned with workforce service periods. This evolution reflects a broader regulatory asset management strategy, paralleling the long-term amortization approach seen in physical assets like Plant Gorgas Unit 10 ($419 million amortized over 13 years through 2037) and Plant Barry Unit 4 ($35 million over 10 years through 2034), indicating a coordinated approach to long-term liability management under regulatory oversight.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's asset retirement obligations related to Plant Hatch evolve from 2023 to 2024, and how does Georgia Power's role as agent for co-owners impact the distribution of these liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company disclosed that Georgia Power had retirement obligations related to Plant Hatch as part of its nuclear decommissioning liabilities, which were computed as the present value of estimated future costs and recorded as asset retirement obligations (AROs). By 2024, Georgia Power continued to operate Plant Hatch as an agent for co-owners, which implies that while Georgia Power manages the plant's operations and associated liabilities, the financial burden of these AROs is shared among the co-owners. This structure, confirmed in the 2024 filing, ensures that Georgia Power remains operationally accountable while the financial obligations are distributed across the ownership structure, maintaining a consistent approach to liability management across years.",

      "answer": "The reclassification of certain line items to 'gains on disposal of investments and other property' in NEE's 2024 consolidated financial statements indicates a shift in focus toward asset disposals as a component of financial reporting. This aligns with NEER's significant drop in segment earnings from $4,400 million in 2022 to just $185 million in 2024, suggesting that gains from disposals may have become a more prominent contributor to reported results as core segment earnings declined. The explicit mention of 'gains on disposal of investments and other property - net' in NEER\u2019s segment disclosures further supports this interpretation, showing that such gains were material enough to warrant separate classification and reemphasis in consolidated reporting.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas contributed $68 million to 'Other regulatory liabilities, deferred', while in 2024, this increased to $84 million. This $16 million increase reflects a growing regulatory burden specific to the gas segment. Across the same period, SO\u2019s total 'Other regulatory liabilities, deferred' balance decreased slightly from $231 million in 2023 to $213 million in 2024. Despite this overall decline, the gas segment's share of the liability grew, indicating a relative shift in regulatory obligations from other segments toward Southern Company Gas. This suggests a potential increase in deferred regulatory liabilities tied to gas operations, possibly due to new compliance requirements or rate-setting mechanisms.",

      "answer": "Southern Company's 2022 financials showed net cash provided from operating activities of $663 million, a significant decrease from 2021 due to reduced fuel cost recovery across its traditional electric operating companies, including Georgia Power. Specifically, Georgia Power's 2021 operating cash flow decreased by $37 million compared to 2020, driven by lower fuel cost recovery, despite partial offsets from customer bill credits and receivable collections. The 2024 filing confirms Georgia Power remains a key subsidiary within the Southern Company system, as evidenced by the continued legal and operational oversight through mechanisms like the Power of Attorney and board resolutions, indicating sustained strategic importance despite the earlier cash flow challenges.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Net Cash Provided from Operating Activities: SO reported $663 million in 2022, down from $1,207 million in 2020, with Georgia Power contributing to the decline.",
        "Hop 2: Net Cash Provided from Operating Activities \u2192 Georgia Power: Georgia Power's operating cash flow decreased by $37 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to reduced fuel cost recovery.",

The net cash used for financing activities in 2020 was primarily related to common stock dividend payments and net repayments of short-term bank debt and commercial paper, partially offset by net issuances of long-term debt and issuances of common stock.\n\n## Alabama Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities increased $311 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in retail revenues associated with a Rate RSE adjustment effective in January 2021 and higher customer usage, as well as the timing of fossil fuel stock purchases and receivable collections, partially offset by decreased fuel cost recovery.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to gross property additions.\n\nThe net cash provided from financing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to capital contributions from Southern Company and net long-term debt issuances, partially offset by common stock dividend payments.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nNet cash provided from operating activities decreased $37 million in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to decreased fuel cost recovery, partially offset by the timing of customer receivable collections and vendor payments and customer bill credits issued in 2020 associated with Tax Reform and 2018 and 2019 earnings in excess of the allowed retail ROE range.\n\nThe net cash used for investing activities in 2021 and 2020 was primarily related to gross property additions, including approximately $1.3 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, related to the construction of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4.

      "answer": "In 2022, NEE allocated interest expense to NEER based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt and differential membership interests sold by NextEra Energy Resources' subsidiaries. By 2024, this allocation methodology remained consistent, but the segment reporting for NextEra Energy Resources now included additional line items such as equity in earnings of equity method investees and changes in unrealized gains (losses) on equity securities held in NEER's nuclear decommissioning funds. This indicates that while the capital structure assumption remained stable, NEE refined its financial reporting around membership interests to reflect broader performance indicators, suggesting a more nuanced approach to managing and reporting on its capital structure through differential ownership interests.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power increased its total capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 by $99 million to replenish construction contingency due to delays and productivity issues (Hop 2). This adjustment directly influenced Georgia Power's 2023 disclosures, where it detailed how construction contingency costs were recovered through the ECCR tariff, with recovery beginning in the year following actual expenditure. The 2023 filings also showed revised cost recovery amounts based on updated compliance filings, including a $10 million increase effective January 1, 2022 (Hop 3).

At December 31, 2021, associated project expenditures included in CWIP totaled approximately $304 million.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $181 million. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power will apply $126 million to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining $55 million will be refunded to customers through bill credits in July 2022.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power\" for additional information.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nPlant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status\n\nConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in which Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including contingency, through the end of the first quarter 2023 and the fourth quarter 2023, respectively, is $10.4 billion.\n\nGeorgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and Unit 4. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n\nDuring 2021, Southern Nuclear performed additional construction remediation work necessary to ensure quality and design standards are met and support system turnovers necessary for Unit 3 hot functional testing, which was completed in July 2021, and fuel load. As a result of Unit 3 challenges including, but not limited to, construction productivity, construction remediation work, the pace of system turnovers, spent fuel pool repairs, and the timeframe and duration for hot functional and other testing, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established in January 2021. Through the fourth quarter 2021, the project continued to face these and other challenges related to the completion of documentation, including inspection records, necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs and begin fuel load. As a result, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan currently targets fuel load for Unit 3 in the second quarter 2022 and an in-service date during the third quarter 2022 and primarily depends on significant improvements in overall construction productivity and production levels, the volume of construction remediation work, the pace of system and area turnovers, and the progression of startup and other testing. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to these milestone dates, an in-service date during the fourth quarter 2022 or the first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 is projected, although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.\n\nAs the result of productivity challenges and temporarily diverting some Unit 4 craft and support resources to Unit 3 construction efforts, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear also further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from those established in January 2021. The temporary diversion of Unit 4 resources to support Unit 3 has continued into the first quarter 2022; therefore, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan targets an in-service date during the first quarter 2023 for Unit 4 and primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as well as appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electricians and pipefitters, being added and maintained. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to the milestone dates, an in-service date during the third or fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4 is projected, although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.\n\nThe latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition, if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt - DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings\" for additional information.\n\nDuring 2021, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $1.3 billion were assigned to the base capital cost forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, and support resources for Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power also increased its total capital cost forecast as of December 31, 2021 by $99 million to replenish construction contingency.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to regulatory scrutiny through Georgia Power in 2022 relate to the $10.753 billion total project capital cost forecast disclosed in 2023 for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company, through its subsidiary Georgia Power, faced extensive regulatory scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) regarding the uncertainties in cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Auditors and regulators were actively evaluating disclosures, construction schedules, and cost forecasts, with concerns about potential risks to financial statements. By 2023, Georgia Power had revised its total project capital cost forecast to $10.753 billion, up from $7.3 billion in 2018, reflecting significant cost overruns and regulatory negotiations. The Georgia PSC ultimately approved a prudence stipulation allowing Georgia Power to recover $7.562 billion of these costs, resolving prior uncertainties. This evolution shows how earlier regulatory pressures and risk disclosures (2022) directly influenced the magnitude and structure of the final capital cost forecast and recovery mechanism (2023).",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company, through Georgia Power, faced a potential additional pre-tax charge of up to $460 million due to Plant Vogtle's cost-sharing provisions triggered by project capital cost overruns. Georgia Power, as the operator of Plant Vogtle, was contractually responsible for managing construction and bore disproportionate financial risk, including 55.7% of qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC, and 65.7% of costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over EAC. By 2024, Southern Company maintained its stake in Georgia Power, indicating continued exposure to Plant Vogtle's financial outcomes through Georgia Power's ongoing operational and cost management responsibilities. This shows an evolution where initial cost-sharing risks identified in 2022 remained relevant in 2024 due to the sustained operational and financial structure managed by Georgia Power.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n## Amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements\n\nIn connection with a September 2018 vote by the Vogtle Owners to continue construction, Georgia Power entered into (i) a binding term sheet (Vogtle Owner Term Sheet) with the other Vogtle Owners and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG Power SPVJ, LLC (MEAG SPVJ), MEAG Power SPVM, LLC (MEAG SPVM), and MEAG Power SPVP, LLC (MEAG SPVP) to take certain actions which partially mitigate potential financial exposure for the other V ogtle Owners, including additional amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements and the purchase of PTCs from the other Vogtle Owners at pre-established prices, and (ii) a term sheet (MEAG Term Sheet) with MEAG Power and MEAG SPVJ to provide up to $300 million of funding with respect to MEAG SPVJ's ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 under certain circumstances. In January 2019, Georgia Power, MEAG Power, and MEAG SPVJ entered into an agreement to implement the provisions of the MEAG Term Sheet. In February 2019, Georgia Power, the other Vogtle Owners, and MEAG Power's wholly-owned subsidiaries MEAG SPVJ, MEAG SPVM, and MEAG SPVP entered into certain amendments to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements to implement the provisions of the Vogtle Owner Term Sheet (Global Amendments).\n\nPursuant to the Global Amendments: (i) each Vogtle Owner must pay its proportionate share of qualifying construction costs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 based on its ownership percentage up to the estimated cost at completion (EAC) for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 which formed the basis of Georgia Power's forecast of $8.4 billion in the nineteenth VCM plus $800 million; (ii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 55.7% of actual qualifying construction costs between $800 million and $1.6 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in $80 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 44.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests; and (iii) Georgia Power will be responsible for 65.7% of qualifying construction costs between $1.6 billion and $2.1 billion over the EAC in the nineteenth VCM (resulting in a further $100 million of potential additional costs to Georgia Power), with the remaining Vogtle Owners responsible for 34.3% of such costs pro rata in accordance with their respective ownership interests. If the EAC is revised and exceeds the EAC in the nineteenth VCM by more than $2.1 billion, each of the other Vogtle Owners will have a one-time option at the time the project budget forecast is so revised to tender a portion of its ownership interest to Georgia Power in exchange for Georgia Power's agreement to pay 100% of such Vogtle Owner's remaining share of total construction costs in excess of the EAC in the nineteenth VCM plus $2.1 billion.\n\nIn addition, pursuant to the Global Amendments, the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction if certain adverse events occur, including, among other events: (i) the bankruptcy of Toshiba; (ii) the termination or rejection in bankruptcy of certain agreements, including the Vogtle Services Agreement, the Bechtel Agreement, or the agency agreement with Southern Nuclear; (iii) Georgia Power's public announcement of its intention not to submit for rate recovery any portion of its investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 or the Georgia PSC determines that any of Georgia Power's costs relating to the construction of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 will not be recovered in retail rates, excluding any additional amounts paid by Georgia Power on behalf of the other Vogtle Owners pursuant to the Global Amendments described above and the first 6% of costs during any six-month VCM reporting period that are disallowed by the Georgia PSC for recovery, or for which Georgia Power elects not to seek cost recovery, through retail rates; and (iv) an incremental extension of one year or more from the seventeenth VCM report estimated in-service dates of November 2021 and November 2022 for Units 3 and 4, respectively. The latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition, if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See Note 8 under \"Long-term Debt - DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings\" for additional information.\n\nGeorgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners do not agree on either the starting dollar amount for the determination of cost increases subject to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the Global Amendments or the extent to which COVID-19-related costs impact the calculation. Based on the definition in the Global Amendments, Georgia Power believes the starting dollar amount is $18.38 billion and the current project capital cost forecast has triggered the cost-sharing provisions. The other V ogtle Owners have asserted that the project cost increases have reached the cost-sharing thresholds and have triggered the tender provisions under the Global Amendments. Georgia Power recorded an additional pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) associated with these cost-sharing and tender provisions, which is included in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may be required to record further pre-tax charges to income of up to approximately $460 million associated with these provisions based on the current project capital cost forecast. The incremental charges associated with these provisions will not be recovered from retail customers. On October 29, 2021, Georgia Power and the other Vogtle Owners entered into an agreement to clarify the process for the tender provisions of the Global Amendments to provide for a decision between 120 and 180 days after the tender option is triggered, which the other Vogtle Owners assert occurred on February 14, 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy Ohio reported a current post-retirement liability of $2 million, which decreased to $1 million in 2024. This reduction indicates a deliberate liability management strategy by the Ohio Segment, which contributed to a broader decline in Duke Energy\u2019s consolidated post-retirement obligations\u2014from $275 million in 2023 to $173 million in 2024. The Ohio Segment\u2019s smaller liability, combined with larger reductions in noncurrent liabilities (from $266 million to $165 million), suggests a focused effort to reduce both short- and long-term post-retirement burdens, aligning with a more aggressive de-risking approach in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny from the Georgia Public Service Commission and independent monitors over uncertainties in the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including construction delays, legal risks, and Nuclear Regulatory Commission licensing hurdles. This scrutiny likely contributed to a high 'Other regulatory liabilities, deferred' balance of $85M in 2023 for Georgia Power. By 2024, this liability decreased to $67M, suggesting either resolution of some uncertainties, improved regulatory alignment, or partial cost recovery realization, indicating a shift in the regulatory landscape or project execution that reduced deferred liabilities tied to the Plant Vogtle project.",

      "answer": "In 2023, SO reported a $1.9 billion (10.2%) decline in Retail Electric Revenues, largely influenced by changes in Georgia Power's rate-setting mechanism tied to its 2022 Annual Rate Proceeding (ARP). This regulatory dependency highlights how Georgia Power's pricing directly affects SO's revenue stream. Despite this decline, SO maintained its legal stake in Georgia Power in 2024, as evidenced by the continued presence of Georgia Power in SO's corporate structure under Power of Attorney and resolutions. This shows that while SO's 2023 financial performance was negatively impacted by Georgia Power's rate adjustments, its structural ownership remained unchanged in 2024.",

      "question": "How did the financial uncertainties surrounding Georgia Power's Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction in 2022 influence the weighted average interest rate on Georgia Power's short-term debt in Q4 2023, and what does this reveal about the evolving risk profile of the project?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant financial uncertainties related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including regulatory scrutiny, potential cost overruns, and legal risks, which were highlighted in the auditor's procedures. By Q4 2023, Georgia Power reported a weighted average interest rate of 5.8% on its short-term debt, up from 3.1% in 2022. This increase suggests that lenders may have factored in the heightened risk associated with the ongoing uncertainties of the Plant Vogtle project. The evolution from 2022 to 2023 indicates that the financial markets and creditors were responding to the prolonged exposure to construction risk, leading to a higher cost of borrowing for Georgia Power.",

      "question": "What does the decline in Georgia Power's 'Other regulatory assets, deferred' from $11 million in 2023 to $3 million in 2024 indicate about Southern Company's regulatory asset management strategy, particularly in light of Georgia Power's exposure to nuclear insurance liabilities in 2023?",
      "answer": "The significant decrease in Georgia Power's 'Other regulatory assets, deferred' from $11 million in 2023 to $3 million in 2024 suggests that Southern Company may be actively reducing or liquidating certain deferred regulatory assets, potentially to offset liabilities or fund operational needs. This trend aligns with a broader reduction in deferred regulatory liabilities as well, which declined from $85 million to $67 million for Georgia Power over the same period. The 2023 exposure to potential nuclear insurance assessments\u2014up to $89 million under NEIL policies\u2014may have prompted a strategic realignment of regulatory assets to strengthen liquidity buffers or reduce exposure to uncertain future liabilities. This indicates a shift toward more conservative regulatory asset management, prioritizing short-term financial resilience over deferred cost recovery.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 construction risks in 2022 influence Georgia Power's net state valuation allowance, and how did this compare to Southern Company's overall net state valuation allowance in 2024 across other subsidiaries and jurisdictions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company, through its Georgia Power subsidiary, faced significant uncertainties related to the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including risks around cost recovery, regulatory scrutiny, and potential legal challenges. These uncertainties were closely monitored by auditors and impacted Georgia Power\u2019s financial disclosures. In 2022, Georgia Power had a net state valuation allowance of $58 million tied to state tax credit carryforwards, partly influenced by the Vogtle project's financial and regulatory risks. By 2024, Southern Company's consolidated net state valuation allowance had increased to $82 million, with significant portions allocated to other subsidiaries like Mississippi Power ($32M), Southern Power ($21M), and New York entities ($25M).

      "question": "How did Southern Company's regulatory risk exposure related to Georgia Power's nuclear assets evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in relation to Plant Hatch decommissioning obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's auditor (Deloitte) highlighted significant regulatory and cost recovery risks tied to Georgia Power\u2019s nuclear construction projects, particularly Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, noting extensive audit procedures focused on disclosures and potential legal or regulatory challenges. By 2023, while Plant Vogtle remained a focal point, Georgia Power's financial statements explicitly included Plant Hatch among its nuclear decommissioning obligations, indicating a broader scope of long-term liabilities. This shift suggests that while immediate attention was on new construction in 2022, by 2023, the company had also formalized its long-term financial responsibility for older nuclear facilities like Plant Hatch, thereby expanding the regulatory risk profile beyond just new builds.",

      "question": "How did the increase in DUK's current post-retirement liability from $9 million in 2023 to $12 million in 2024 impact the Piedmont Segment's net liability and intangible asset valuation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, DUK reported a current post-retirement liability of $9 million, with the Piedmont Segment showing a prefunded post-retirement benefit of $10 million and a net liability (asset) of $(10) million. By 2024, DUK\u2019s current post-retirement liability increased to $12 million, while the Piedmont Segment\u2019s prefunded benefit rose to $12 million, resulting in a net liability (asset) of $(12) million. Additionally, the Piedmont Segment\u2019s total intangible assets, net, stood at $16 million in 2024. This indicates that despite a higher prefunded benefit, the segment\u2019s net liability position worsened year-over-year, and the growing post-retirement obligation may have exerted financial pressure that affected asset valuation strategies.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny over Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including independent monitoring, NRC inspections, and legal inquiries, due to uncertainties in cost recovery. By 2024, this risk was partially reflected in Alabama Power's derivative liabilities, which stood at $110 million for regulatory hedging instruments, compared to Georgia Power's $122 million in similar liabilities. This suggests that while Georgia Power remained directly exposed through construction and regulatory processes, Alabama Power increasingly bore financial risk through derivative instruments tied to the same project.",

Southern Nuclear operates and provides services to Alabama Power's and Georgia Power's nuclear plants.\n\nIn addition, Georgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases totaling $35 million at December 31, 2024, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of Plant V ogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. See Note 3 to the financial statements under \"Commitments\" in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Titles to Property\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies', Southern Power's, and SEGCO's interests in the principal plants and other important units of the respective companies are owned in fee by such companies, subject to the following major encumbrances: (1) a leasehold interest granted by Mississippi Power's largest retail customer, Chevron Products Company (Chevron), at the Chevron refinery, where five combustion turbines owned by Mississippi Power are located and used for co-generation, as well as liens on these assets pursuant to the related co-generation agreements and (2) liens associated with Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE under its loan guarantee, which are secured by a first priority lien on (a) G eorgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 and (b) G eorgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. See Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Assets Subject to Lien\" and Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. The traditional electric operating companies own the fee interests in certain of their principal plants as tenants in common. See \"Jointly-Owned Facilities\" herein and Note 5 to the financial statements under \"Joint Ownership Agreements\" in Item 8 herein for additional information. Properties such as electric transmission and distribution lines, steam heating mains, and gas pipelines are constructed principally on rights-of-way, which are maintained under franchise or are held by easement only. A substantial portion of lands submerged by reservoirs is held under flood right easements. In addition, certain of the renewable generating facilities occupy or use real property that is not owned, primarily through various leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits, or licenses from private landowners or governmental entities.\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Company Gas considers its properties to be adequately maintained, substantially in good operating condition, and suitable for their intended purpose. The following sections provide the location and general character of the materially important properties that are used by the segments of Southern Company Gas. Substantially all of Nicor G as' properties are subject to the lien of the indenture securing its first mortgage bonds. See Note 8 to the financial statements in Item 8 herein for additional information.\n\n## Distribution and Transmission Mains\n\nSouthern Company Gas' distribution systems transport natural gas from its pipeline suppliers to customers in its service areas. These systems consist primarily of distribution and transmission mains, compressor stations, peak shaving/storage plants, service lines, meters, and regulators. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment owned approximately 78,500 miles of underground distribution and transmission mains, which are located on easements or rights-of-way that generally provide for perpetual use.\n\n## Storage Assets\n\n## Gas Distribution Operations\n\nSouthern Company Gas owns and operates eight underground natural gas storage fields in Illinois with a total working capacity of approximately 150 Bcf, approximately 135 Bcf of which is usually cycled on an annual basis. This system is designed to meet about 50% of the estimated peak-day deliveries and approximately 40% of the normal winter deliveries in Illinois. This level of storage capability provides Nicor Gas with supply flex ibility, improves the reliability of deliveries, and helps mitigate the risk associated with seasonal price movements.\n\nSouthern Company Gas also has four LNG plants located in Georgia and Tennessee with total LNG storage capacity of approximately 7.0 Bcf. In addition, Southern Company Gas owns two propane storage facilities in Virginia, each with storage capacity of approximately 0.3 Bcf. The LNG plants and propane storage facilities are used by Southern Company Gas' gas distribution operations segment to supplement natural gas supply during peak usage periods.\n\n## All Other\n\nIn September 2022, certain affiliates of Southern Company Gas entered into agreements to sell two natural gas storage facilities located in California and Texas. The sale of the Texas facility was completed in November 2022 and the sale of the California",

      "question": "How did the financial risk exposure of Georgia Power in 2023, particularly regarding potential nuclear insurance assessments, influence the classification and management of securities due within one year by Southern Company in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power faced a maximum potential annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL nuclear insurance policies, which could have significantly impacted Southern Company's financial condition if triggered. By 2024, this risk was managed in part through the classification of $117 million in floating rate senior notes due 2074 as 'securities due within one year' on Southern Company's balance sheet, due to their repayable-at-option-of-holders structure beginning in 2025. This reflects a strategic financial alignment to address potential liabilities from the prior year while maintaining flexibility through long-dated debt instruments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2023) \u2192 Georgia Power: Georgia Power had a maximum potential annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL nuclear insurance policies as of December 31, 2023, representing a material financial risk.",
        "Hop 2: Georgia Power \u2192 Securities Due Within One Year: Georgia Power's $117 million in Series 2024C Floating Rate Senior Notes due 2074 were classified as securities due within one year because they were repayable at the option of holders beginning in 2025.",
        "Hop 3: Securities Due Within One Year \u2190 SO(2024): Southern Company included Georgia Power's $117 million floating rate senior notes in its 'securities due within one year' classification on the 2024 balance sheet, reflecting direct financial exposure management."

Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee the obligations of Georgia Power under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, Georgia Power was authorized to make term loan borrowings through the FFB in an amount up to approximately $5.130 billion.\n\nIn 2021, Georgia Power made the final borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities and no further borrowings are permitted. During 2024, Georgia Power made principal amortization payments of $86 million under the FFB Credit Facilities.

In addition, G eorgia Power is subject to project-related reporting requirements and other project-specific covenants and events of default.\n\nIn the event certain mandatory prepayment events occur, Georgia Power will be required to prepay the outstanding principal amount of all borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years (with level principal amortization). Among other things, these mandatory prepayment events include (i) loss of necessary governmental approvals for operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) loss of regulation by the Georgia PSC; (iii) cost disallowances by the Georgia PSC that could have a material adverse effect on Georgia Power's ability to repay the outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities; (iv) certain material casualty losses or a governmental taking of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; or (v) loss of access to the intellectual property rights necessary to operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Under certain circumstances, insurance proceeds and any proceeds from an event of taking must be applied to immediately prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities.

      "question": "How did the decrease in Georgia Power's investment in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from $1.1 billion in 2023 to $0.2 billion in 2024 affect Southern Company's overall gross property additions and financing strategy across years?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power invested $1.1 billion in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, representing a significant portion of its gross property additions. By 2024, this investment dropped to $0.2 billion, signaling the nearing completion of the project. This reduction in capital expenditure contributed to a broader decline in Southern Company's overall gross property additions, as reflected in the lower cash used for investing activities across its subsidiaries. In response, Georgia Power adjusted its financing strategy, relying more on capital contributions from Southern Company and net issuances of senior notes in 2024, while reducing commercial paper borrowings. This shift reflects a transition from heavy construction financing to a more stable capital structure as major projects conclude.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company Gas's management of increased natural gas hedge volumes from 2022 to 2024 affect its collateral requirements and risk exposure?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Southern Company Gas increased its total hedge volume from 68 million mmBtu (2022) to 83 million mmBtu (2024). Despite this increase, the segment maintained effective risk management practices, including the use of netting agreements and strict counterparty credit policies. As a result, Southern Company Gas only held $17 million in cash collateral on deposit in broker margin accounts at the end of 2024. The segment also continued to require counterparties to post collateral or other credit security, ensuring that exposure to counterparty credit risk remained controlled. This demonstrates that even with higher hedge volumes, Southern Company Gas successfully managed its risk exposure through disciplined credit and collateral management strategies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Total Hedge Volume: Southern Company Gas reported a total hedge volume of 68 million mmBtu at the end of 2021 (as disclosed in the 2022 filing).",
        "Hop 2: Total Hedge Volume \u2192 Southern Company Gas: The hedge volumes are directly tied to Southern Company Gas's risk exposure and require specific risk management controls.",
        "Hop 3: Southern Company Gas \u2190 SO(2024): By 2024, Southern Company Gas had increased its total hedge volume to 83 million mmBtu and maintained $17 million in cash collateral on deposit, reflecting its risk mitigation strategies."

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $17 million.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&amp;P, or Fitch or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit ex posure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their ex posure to counterparty credit risk.\n\nSouthern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investmentgrade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against",

As a result, the senior notes are classified as securities due w ithin one year on the balance sheets of S outhern Company and Alabama Pow er at December 31, 2024.\n\n(c) Amounts include principal amortization related to the FFB borrow ings; how ever, the final maturity date is February 20, 2044. S ee \"DOE Loan G uarantee Borrow ings\" herein for additional information. G eorgia Pow er's 2025 maturities include approximately $117 million aggregate principal amount of S eries 2024C Floating Rate S enior Notes due November 15, 2074 that are repayable at the option of the holders at certain dates beginning in 2025. As a result, the senior notes are classified as securities due w ithin one year on the balance sheets of Southern Company and G eorgia Pow er at December 31, 2024.\n\n(d) Southern Pow er's 2026 maturities include $564 million of euro-denominated debt at the U.S . dollar-denominated hedge settlement amount.\n\n## DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings\n\nPursuant to the loan guarantee program established under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (Title XVII Loan Guarantee Program), Georgia Power and the DOE entered into a loan guarantee agreement in 2014 and the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement in 2019. Under the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, the DOE agreed to guarantee the obligations of Georgia Power under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, Georgia Power was authorized to make term loan borrowings through the FFB in an amount up to approximately $5.130 billion.\n\nIn 2021, Georgia Power made the final borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities and no further borrowings are permitted. During 2024, Georgia Power made principal amortization payments of $86 million under the FFB Credit Facilities. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, Georgia Power had $4.7 billion and $4.8 billion of borrowings outstanding under the FFB Credit Facilities, respectively.\n\nAll borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities are full recourse to Georgia Power, and Georgia Power is obligated to reimburse the DOE for any payments the DOE is required to make to the FFB under its guarantee. Georgia Power's reimbursement obligations to the DOE are secured by a first priority lien on (i) Georgia Power's undivided ownership interest in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (primarily the units, the related real property, and any nuclear fuel loaded in the reactor core) and (ii) Georgia Power's rights and obligations under the principal contracts relating to Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. There are no restrictions on Georgia Power's ability to grant liens on other property.\n\nThe final maturity date for each advance under the FFB Credit Facilities is February 20, 2044. Interest is payable quarterly and principal payments began in 2020. Each borrowing under the FFB Credit Facilities bears interest at a fix ed rate equal to the applicable U.S. Treasury rate at the time of the borrowing plus a spread equal to 0.375%.\n\nUnder the Amended and Restated Loan Guarantee Agreement, Georgia Power is subject to customary borrower affirmative and negative covenants and events of default. In addition, G eorgia Power is subject to project-related reporting requirements and other project-specific covenants and events of default.\n\nIn the event certain mandatory prepayment events occur, Georgia Power will be required to prepay the outstanding principal amount of all borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years (with level principal amortization). Among other things, these mandatory prepayment events include (i) loss of necessary governmental approvals for operation of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; (ii) loss of regulation by the Georgia PSC; (iii) cost disallowances by the Georgia PSC that could have a material adverse effect on Georgia Power's ability to repay the outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities; (iv) certain material casualty losses or a governmental taking of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4; or (v) loss of access to the intellectual property rights necessary to operate Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. Under certain circumstances, insurance proceeds and any proceeds from an event of taking must be applied to immediately prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. G eorgia Power also may voluntarily prepay outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities. Under the FFB Credit Facilities, any prepayment (whether mandatory or optional) will be made with a make-whole premium or discount, as applicable.\n\nSee Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy had a credit facility with Commercial Retail Customer (CRC) of $350 million, with $587 million in Restricted Receivables reported. By 2024, Duke Energy terminated its credit facility with CRC after repaying $350 million in borrowings. At the time of termination, the Restricted Receivables associated with CRC totaled $682 million, which was transferred back to Duke Energy Ohio ($316 million) and Duke Energy Indiana ($366 million) to be collected. This indicates that while the credit facility was fully repaid, the level of restricted receivables increased from 2022 to 2024, reflecting ongoing customer payment obligations.",

O n a revolving basis, C R C  bought certain accounts receivable arising from  the sale of electricity, natural gas and related services from  D uke E nergy O hio and D uke E nergy Indiana. C R C  then borrowed am ounts under a credit facility to buy the receivables from  D uke E nergy O hio and Duke E nergy Indiana. Borrowing availability from  the credit facility was lim ited to the am ount of qualified receivables sold to C R C , which generally excluded receivables past due more than a predeterm ined num ber of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation was cash collections from the receivables.\n\nThe proceeds D uke E nergy Ohio and D uke E nergy Indiana received from  the sale of receivables to C R C  were approxim ately 75% cash and 25% in the form  of a subordinated note from  C R C . T he subordinated note was a retained interest in the receivables sold.\n\nCRC was considered a VIE  because (i) equity capitalization was insufficient to support its operations, (ii) power to direct the activities that m ost significantly im pact the econom ic perform ance of the entity was not held by the equity holder and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of C R C  were funded by D uke E nergy. T he m ost significant activities that im pacted the econom ic perform ance of C R C  were decisions m ade to m anage delinquent receivables. D uke E nergy was considered the prim ary beneficiary and consolidated C R C  as it m ade these decisions. N either D uke E nergy O hio nor D uke E nergy Indiana consolidated C R C .\n\nI n M arch 2024, D uke E nergy repaid all outstanding C R C  borrowings totaling $350 m illion and term inated the related C R C  credit facility. Additionally, D uke E nergy's related restricted receivables outstanding at C R C  at the tim e of term ination totaled $682 m illion, consisting of $316 m illion and $366 m illion of restricted receivables that were transferred back to D uke Energy Indiana and D uke E nergy O hio, respectively, to be collected and reported as R eceivables on the C onsolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Receivables Financing - Credit Facilities\n\nThe following table sum m arizes the am ounts and expiration dates of the credit facilities and associated restricted receivables described above.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company, through its segment Georgia Power, faced significant uncertainties regarding the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as highlighted by Deloitte's audit procedures which focused on construction status, cost forecasts, regulatory filings, and legal risks. By 2023, Georgia Power had entered into a Prudency Stipulation that allowed for the recovery of $7.562 billion in total construction and capital costs, including AFUDC financing costs above $4.418 billion. This shows that the earlier uncertainties were partially resolved through regulatory agreement, shifting from risk assessment and disclosure in 2022 to a defined cost recovery mechanism in 2023, with Georgia Power now operating under a certified threshold for AFUDC financing costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Georgia Power: Southern Company's 2022 disclosures revealed that Georgia Power faced significant uncertainties in recovering the construction costs of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including regulatory scrutiny and potential legal risks.",

      "answer": "Alabama Power's prepaid other postretirement benefit costs increased from $28 million at December 31, 2022, to $74 million at December 31, 2023, as disclosed in Southern Company's 2023 filing. Southern Company did not report any prepaid other postretirement benefit costs on a consolidated basis in either year.

        "Hop 3: [Prepaid other postretirement benefit costs] \u2190 [SO](2023): Southern Company's consolidated financial statements for 2023 showed $0 for prepaid other postretirement benefit costs, indicating that the increase in Alabama Power's costs was not consolidated."

      "question": "How did the change in Alabama Power's net gain from pension and postretirement benefit plans between 2022 and 2024 reflect on Southern Company's overall investment performance and retirement liability management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power reported a net gain of $52 million from pension and postretirement benefit plans, which decreased to $48 million by 2024. This $4 million decline indicates a slight weakening in investment performance or adjustments in liability management strategies over the two-year period. The reduction in net gain suggests Southern Company may have faced challenges in maintaining the same level of returns on pension fund investments or had to recalibrate actuarial assumptions in response to changing market conditions. The evolution of this metric is critical for understanding how Southern Company has balanced its investment strategy against growing retirement obligations across its utility segments.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [SO](2022) \u2192 [Alabama Power]: Southern Company's 2022 report included Alabama Power's financial disclosures, such as a $52 million net gain from pension and postretirement benefit plans.",
        "Hop 2: [Alabama Power] \u2192 [Net Gain - Investment]: Alabama Power's pension fund performance, specifically the $52 million net gain in 2022 and $48 million in 2024, reflects the investment returns and liability adjustments within the company's benefit plans.",
        "Hop 3: [Net Gain - Investment] \u2190 [SO](2024): By 2024, Southern Company's consolidated financial statements showed Alabama Power's net gain had decreased, signaling a shift in investment performance or liability management approach."

      "question": "How did Southern Company's ownership structure of Plant Scherer in 2022 and its connection to Georgia Power influence the potential financial liability exposure for Georgia Power in 2023, particularly in relation to nuclear insurance assessments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's subsidiary Georgia Power held only an 8.4% ownership stake in Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 and a 75% stake in Unit 3, jointly owning the plant with entities like OPC, MEAG Power, and Dalton. This joint ownership meant Georgia Power was operationally responsible and exposed to shared liabilities. By 2023, Georgia Power faced a maximum annual assessment of $89 million under NEIL nuclear insurance policies, significantly higher than Alabama Power\u2019s $54 million, reflecting its broader liability exposure across multiple plants including those co-owned like Plant Scherer. This suggests that Georgia Power's involvement in jointly owned plants increased its potential financial burden from nuclear risk, despite varying ownership percentages.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Plant Scherer: Southern Company's subsidiaries, including Georgia Power, held an 8.4% ownership stake in Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 and 75% in Unit 3.",
        "Hop 2: Plant Scherer \u2192 Georgia Power: Georgia Power was contractually responsible for operation and maintenance of its undivided interests in jointly owned plants like Plant Scherer, and thus exposed to associated liabilities.",
        "Hop 3: Georgia Power \u2190 SO(2023): Georgia Power faced a maximum annual nuclear insurance assessment of $89 million under NEIL policies, higher than Alabama Power\u2019s $54 million, indicating increased liability exposure."

      "question": "How did the cost of nuclear-related services provided by Southern Nuclear to Georgia Power in 2022 influence the financial structure of the Southern Company power pool in 2023, particularly in relation to Plant Vogtle Unit 4 construction management?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power incurred $895 million in costs for nuclear-related services from Southern Nuclear, including construction management for Plant Vogtle Unit 4, which directly impacted Georgia Power's financial disclosures regarding uncertainties in cost recovery. By 2023, these services continued under the Southern Company power pool structure, where Georgia Power's power purchases from affiliates, including Southern Nuclear, were integrated into the pool's coordinated economic dispatch and cost-sharing framework. This interdependency meant that the escalating costs of Plant Vogtle Unit 4 construction were absorbed into the broader power pool economics, affecting the cost recovery mechanisms and financial transparency of the Southern Company system as a whole.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Georgia Power: In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant financial scrutiny over the cost recovery uncertainties of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, with Southern Nuclear providing construction management services that contributed to $895 million in nuclear-related service costs.",
        "Hop 2: Georgia Power \u2192 Southern Company Power Pool: Georgia Power's nuclear-related costs were integrated into the Southern Company power pool through cost-sharing agreements and power purchase arrangements, where system resources are centrally dispatched and costs are proportionally shared.",
        "Hop 3: Southern Company Power Pool \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, the Southern Company power pool's financial structure reflected the ongoing integration of Georgia Power's Plant Vogtle Unit 4 construction costs, with the pool's operations governed by centralized dispatch and cost recovery mechanisms that influenced the overall financial transparency of the system."

      "answer": "The 2022 regulatory scrutiny by the Georgia Public Service Commission and Nuclear Regulatory Commission over Plant Vogtle Unit 3 and 4 construction uncertainties prompted Georgia Power to defer and disclose potential cost recovery risks. By 2023, these uncertainties, among other minor items, were incorporated into Georgia Power's regulatory accounting practices as part of 'numerous immaterial components' with amortization periods not exceeding 10 years. This reflects a shift from uncertainty assessment in 2022 to structured amortization of smaller, less material regulatory items in 2023, aligning with broader utility accounting practices where regulatory assets are systematically amortized over approved timeframes in response to oversight.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax credit of approximately $228 million ($170 million after tax) in the fourth quarter to recognize CWIP costs previously charged to income, which became recoverable through retail rates following the Georgia PSC's approval of the Prudency Stipulation. This credit was directly tied to the resolution of regulatory uncertainty around the $10.8 billion total project capital cost forecast for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4. In 2024, this credit was reflected in SO's financial disclosures as a recognized recovery mechanism, with the associated AFUDC on these costs also being recognized. The resolution of the prudence proceeding allowed Georgia Power to shift from a period of significant cost uncertainty and pre-tax charges (e.g., $1.1 billion in 2018 and hundreds of millions more in 2020\u20132022) to a stabilized recovery framework, directly influencing the 2024 financial reporting and regulatory asset treatment.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nThe approval of the Prudency Stipulation resolved all issues for determination by the Georgia PSC regarding the reasonableness, prudence, and cost recovery for the remaining Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction and capital costs not already in retail base rates.\n\nAs a result of the Georgia PSC's approval of the Prudency Stipulation, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax credit to income of approximately $228 million ($170 million after tax ) in the fourth quarter 2023 to recognize CWIP costs previously charged to income, which are now recoverable through retail rates. Associated AFUDC on these costs, which totaled approximately $14 million, was also recognized.\n\n## Mississippi Power\n\nMississippi Power's rates and charges for service to retail customers are subject to the regulatory oversight of the Mississippi PSC. Mississippi Power's rates are a combination of base rates and several separate cost recovery clauses for specific categories of costs. These separate cost recovery clauses address such items as fuel and purchased power, ad valorem taxes, property damage, and the costs of compliance with environmental laws and regulations. Costs not addressed through one of the specific cost recovery clauses are expected to be recovered through Mississippi Power's base rates.\n\n## Performance Evaluation Plan\n\nMississippi Power's retail base rates generally are set under the PEP, a rate plan approved by the Mississippi PSC. In recognition that Mississippi Power's long-term financial success is dependent upon how well it satisfies its customers' needs, PEP includes performance indicators that directly tie customer service indicators to Mississippi Power's allowed ROE. PEP measures Mississippi Power's performance on a 10-point scale as a weighted average of results in three areas: average customer price, as compared to prices of other regional utilities (weighted at 40%); service reliability, measured in percentage of time customers had electric service (40%); and customer satisfaction, measured in a survey of residential customers (20%). Typically, two PEP filings are made for each calendar year: the PEP projected filing in March of the current year and the PEP lookback filing in March of the subsequent year. The annual PEP projected filings utilize a historic test year adjusted for \"known and measurable\" changes and discounted cash flow and regression formulas to determine base ROE. The PEP lookback filing reflects the actual revenue requirement.\n\nIn June 2022, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filing, resulting in an annual increase in revenues of approximately $18 million, or 1.9%, effective with the first billing cycle of April 2022. In June 2023 and on June 13, 2024, the Mississippi PSC approved Mississippi Power's annual retail PEP filings for 2023 and 2024, respectively, with no change in retail rates.\n\n## Integrated Resource Plans\n\nIn 2020, the Mississippi PSC issued an order requiring Mississippi Power to incorporate into its 2021 IRP a schedule of early or anticipated retirement of 950 MWs of fossil-steam generation by year-end 2027 to reduce the excess reserve margin Mississippi Power anticipated at that time. The order stated that Mississippi Power will be allowed to defer any retirement-related costs as regulatory assets for future recovery.\n\nIn 2021, the Mississippi PSC concluded its review of Mississippi Power's 2021 IRP. The 2021 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 (268 MWs) and Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 (206 MWs based on 40% ownership) in December 2023, 2025, and 2026, respectively, consistent with each unit's remaining useful life in the most recent approved depreciation studies. In addition, the schedule reflected the early retirement of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 (502 MWs based on 50% ownership) by the end of 2027.\n\nIn October 2023, Mississippi Power signed an affiliate PPA with Georgia Power for 750 MWs of capacity, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n\nOn April 26, 2024, Mississippi Power filed its 2024 IRP with the Mississippi PSC. The Mississippi PSC did not note any deficiencies within the prescribed 120-day review period; therefore, the filing is concluded. The 2024 IRP included a schedule to retire Plant Watson Unit 4 and Plant Greene County Units 1 and 2 and to retire early Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2, all by the end of 2028, which is consistent with the completion of Mississippi Power's affiliate PPA with Georgia Power. On January 9, 2025, Mississippi Power notified the Mississippi PSC of its intent to extend the retirement date of Plant Daniel Unit 2 and potentially ex tend the retirement dates of other fossil steam units beyond their current 2028 retirement dates in order to serve recently signed economic development loads of approximately 600 MWs.\n\nThe remaining net book value of Plant Daniel Units 1 and 2 was approximately $478 million at December 31, 2024, and Mississippi Power is continuing to depreciate these units using the current approved rates. Mississippi Power expects to reclassify the net book value remaining at retirement to a regulatory asset to be amortized over a period to be determined by the Mississippi",

      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power's regulatory assets included generation and purchased power details, which formed part of its broader asset structure. By 2023, these assets included a specific classification for 'immaterial components' that comprised numerous smaller items, with amortization periods generally not exceeding 20 years. This evolution reflects a more granular breakdown of regulatory assets, with Alabama Power's portion extending up to 20 years, compared to shorter periods for other subsidiaries like Georgia Power (10 years). The shift indicates a formalization of previously aggregated disclosures into distinct, though still immaterial, regulatory components.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant regulatory scrutiny and uncertainty over the cost recovery for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including construction delays and potential legal and regulatory challenges that could impact financial disclosures. By 2024, Georgia Power began generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Unit 4 in Q2 2024, and for Unit 3 in Q3 2023, recognizing them as income tax benefits. Additionally, Georgia Power started purchasing PTCs from other Vogtle joint owners, which contributed to tax benefits. However, despite these federal tax benefits, Georgia Power carried $515 million in net state tax credit carryforwards for Georgia, of which only $472 million were expected to be utilized, with a valuation allowance of $124 million, indicating that the state-level benefits were not fully realizable. The earlier regulatory risks around cost recovery appear to have delayed the full recognition and monetization of tax benefits, which only began to materialize in 2023\u20132024 as units came online and PTCs were secured through both generation and intercompany purchases.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS\n\n## Natural Gas\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from natural gas facilities are primarily through long-term PPAs that consist of two types of agreements. The first type, referred to as a unit or block sale, is a customer purchase from a dedicated generating unit where all or a portion of the generation from that unit is reserved for that customer. Southern Power typically has the ability to serve the unit or block sale customer from an alternate resource. The second type, referred to as requirements service, provides that Southern Power serve the customer's capacity and energy requirements from a combination of the customer's own generating units and from Southern Power resources not dedicated to serve unit or block sales. Southern Power has rights to purchase power provided by the requirements customers' resources when economically viable.\n\nAs a general matter, substantially all of the PPAs provide that the purchasers are responsible for either procuring the fuel (tolling agreements) or reimbursing Southern Power for substantially all of the cost of fuel or purchased power relating to the energy delivered under such PPAs. To the extent a particular generating facility does not meet the operational requirements contemplated in the PPAs, Southern Power may be responsible for excess fuel costs. With respect to fuel transportation risk, most of Southern Power's PPAs provide that the counterparties are responsible for the availability of fuel transportation to the particular generating facility.\n\nCapacity charges that form part of the PPA payments are designed to recover fixed and variable operation and maintenance costs based on dollars-per-kilowatt year. In general, to reduce Southern Power's exposure to certain operation and maintenance costs, Southern Power has LTSAs. See Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Long-Term Service Agreements\" for additional information.\n\n## Solar and Wind\n\nSouthern Power's electricity sales from solar and wind generating facilities are also primarily through long-term PPAs; however, these PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or provide Southern Power a certain fixed price for the electricity sold to the grid. As a result, Southern Power's ability to recover fix ed and variable operations and maintenance ex penses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Generally, under the renewable generation PPAs, the purchasing party retains the right to keep or resell the associated renewable energy credits.\n\n## Income Tax Matters\n\n## Consolidated Income Taxes\n\nThe impact of certain tax events at Southern Company and/or its other subsidiaries can, and does, affect each Registrant's ability to utilize certain tax  credits. See \"Tax Credits\" and ACCOUNTING POLICIES - \"Application of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Accounting for Income Taxes\" herein and Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Tax Credits\n\nSouthern Company receives ITCs and PTCs in connection with investments in solar, wind, fuel cell, advanced nuclear, hydroelectric, and battery energy storage facilities primarily at Southern Power, G eorgia Power, and Alabama Power.\n\nSouthern Power's ITCs relate to its investment in new solar facilities and battery energy storage facilities (co-located with ex isting solar facilities) that are acquired or constructed and its PTCs relate to the first 10 years of energy production from its wind and solar facilities, which have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on Southern Power's cash flows and net income. At December 31, 2024, Southern Company and Southern Power had approximately $765 million and $384 million, respectively, of unutilized federal ITCs and PTCs, which are currently projected to be fully utilized by 2028 but could be further delayed. Since 2018, Southern Power has utilized tax equity partnerships for certain wind, solar, and battery energy storage projects, where the tax  equity partner takes significantly all of the respective federal tax  benefits. These tax  equity partnerships are consolidated in Southern Company's and Southern Power's financial statements using the HLBV methodology to allocate partnership gains and losses.\n\nIn the third quarter 2023 and the second quarter 2024, Georgia Power started generating advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, respectively, beginning on each unit's respective in-service date. PTCs are recognized as an income tax benefit based on KWH production. In addition, pursuant to the Vogtle Joint Ownership Agreements (as defined in Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction - Cost and Schedule\"), Georgia Power is purchasing advanced nuclear PTCs for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 from the other Vogtle Owners. The gain recognized on the purchase of the joint owner PTCs is recognized as an income tax benefit.

      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy's Piedmont segment reported $71 million in remaining performance obligations, indicating early-stage planning or commitments. By 2024, the Closure of Ash Impoundments was explicitly disclosed with a total asset retirement obligation of $5,173 million across the company, but notably, the Piedmont segment showed $0 liability for this category, suggesting a strategic reallocation or completion of obligations specific to ash impoundment closure for Piedmont. This indicates a significant shift in liability management, where Piedmont's responsibilities were either transferred or fully executed between 2022 and 2024.",

These risks likely delayed or altered the timing of tax benefit realization. By 2023, Southern Company reported $12 million in Federal ITC/PTC carryforwards for Georgia Power, with an expected utilization by 2028. This suggests that earlier construction uncertainties may have pushed back the expected utilization timeline, aligning with a more conservative forecast of when these tax credits can be effectively used.",

      "question": "How did Southern Company's decline in 'Total other natural gas revenues' from $2,609 million in 2022 to $687 million in 2023 impact Alabama Power's exposure to financial risk, particularly in light of Alabama Power's potential liability from the NEIL policy assessments and other operational challenges in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company reported $2,609 million in 'Total other natural gas revenues', a significant portion of which was tied to gas marketing and wholesale services. By 2023, this figure dropped sharply to $687 million, indicating a major contraction in this revenue stream. This decline likely reduced the financial buffer available to Southern Company and its segments, including Alabama Power. In 2023, Alabama Power faced increased financial risk exposure, including a potential maximum annual assessment of $54 million under the NEIL insurance policies and ongoing legal uncertainties related to pole rental rates with AT&T. The sharp drop in natural gas-related revenues may have left Alabama Power more vulnerable to these liabilities, increasing the potential impact on Southern Company's consolidated financial position and operational flexibility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Total other natural gas revenues: Southern Company reported $2,609 million in other natural gas revenues in 2022, primarily from gas marketing and wholesale services.",
        "Hop 2: Total other natural gas revenues \u2192 Alabama Power: These revenues contributed to the overall financial health and risk mitigation capacity of Southern Company and its segments, including Alabama Power.",
        "Hop 3: Alabama Power \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, Southern Company's 'Total other natural gas revenues' dropped to $687 million, while Alabama Power faced new financial risks, including a $54 million maximum annual NEIL policy assessment and unresolved legal disputes."

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company's Wholesale Electric Revenues included a significant contribution from Short-Term Opportunity Sales, which are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the company's variable production costs. By 2023, wholesale electric revenues decreased by $1.2 billion, or 32.2%, primarily due to a drop in energy revenues, which were impacted by lower fuel and purchased power prices compared to 2022. Short-Term Opportunity Sales, as a component of these revenues, saw reduced market-based margins due to the overall decline in energy revenues. This shift altered the composition of wholesale revenues, emphasizing the sensitivity of Short-Term Opportunity Sales to market price fluctuations and their direct impact on the energy revenue segment of Wholesale Electric Revenues.",

The increase in rates and pricing in 2021 was primarily due to an increase effective January 1, 2021 in Alabama Power's Rate RSE, net of a related customer refund, and increases at Georgia Power resulting from higher contributions by commercial and industrial customers with variable demand-driven pricing, fixed residential customer bill programs, the effects of higher KWH sales on ECCR tariff revenues, and base tariff increases in accordance with the 2019 ARP, partially offset by a decrease in Georgia Power's NCCR tariff, both effective January 1, 2021.\n\nElectric rates for the traditional electric operating companies include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel costs, including the energy component of purchased power costs. Under these provisions, fuel revenues generally equal fuel expenses, including the energy component of PPA costs, and do not affect net income. The traditional electric operating companies each have one or more regulatory mechanisms to recover other costs such as environmental and other compliance costs, storm damage, new plants, and PPA capacity costs.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power\" and \"Georgia Power\" for additional information. Also see \"Energy Sales\" herein for a discussion of changes in the volume of energy sold, including changes related to sales growth (decline) and weather.\n\nWholesale electric revenues consist of revenues from PPAs and short-term opportunity sales. Wholesale electric revenues from PPAs (other than solar and wind PPAs) have both capacity and energy components. Capacity revenues generally represent the greatest contribution to net income and are designed to provide recovery of fixed costs plus a return on investment. Energy revenues will vary depending on fuel prices, the market prices of wholesale energy compared to the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's electric service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. Increases and decreases in energy revenues that are driven by fuel prices are accompanied by an increase or decrease in fuel costs and do not have a significant impact on net income. Energy sales from solar and wind PPAs do not have a capacity charge and customers either purchase the energy output of a dedicated renewable facility through an energy charge or through a fixed price related to the energy. As a result, the ability to recover fixed and variable operations and maintenance expenses is dependent upon the level of energy generated from these facilities, which can be impacted by weather conditions, equipment performance, transmission constraints, and other factors. Wholesale electric revenues at Mississippi Power include FERC-regulated MRA sales under cost-based tariffs as well as market-based sales. Short-term opportunity sales are made at market-based rates that generally provide a margin above the Southern Company system's variable cost to produce the energy.\n\nWholesale electric revenues from power sales were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Georgia Power's Prior Service Cost liability decreased from $5 million in 2023 to $4 million in 2024, indicating a reduction of $1 million over the year. This change is part of a broader trend across Southern Company's subsidiaries, where the total Prior Service Cost liability for all entities (including Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power) declined from $13 million in 2023 to $11 million in 2024. The reduction suggests a focused effort on managing pension liabilities, particularly within the regulated utility segments like Georgia Power, which is a key component of Southern Company's operations.",

      "question": "How did the regulatory treatment of Atlanta Gas Light within Southern Company's portfolio change between 2022 and 2024, particularly regarding authorized ROE and cost recovery mechanisms, given that Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas to end-use customers?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Atlanta Gas Light had an authorized Return on Equity (ROE) of 10.25%, with no bad debt rider or energy efficiency plan in place, and its last base rate case decision was in 2019. By 2024, Southern Company Gas emphasized that Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, distinguishing it from other gas distribution utilities, which typically have cost recovery mechanisms tied to gas prices and customer consumption. Unlike other utilities in the portfolio, Atlanta Gas Light was not subject to the same natural gas cost recovery provisions, as its operations did not involve direct gas sales to consumers. This regulatory distinction meant that Atlanta Gas Light's financial performance was not impacted by fluctuations in natural gas prices or weather-related demand changes, unlike the other gas distribution utilities which relied on weather normalization and cost recovery mechanisms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [SO](2022) \u2192 [Authorized ROE]: In 2022, Southern Company disclosed that Atlanta Gas Light had an authorized ROE of 10.25%, with a base rate case decision from 2019 and no bad debt rider or energy efficiency plan.",
        "Hop 2: [Authorized ROE] \u2192 [Atlanta Gas Light]: The authorized ROE figures and regulatory mechanisms were disclosed in the context of Atlanta Gas Light's specific regulatory environment, including the absence of certain riders and mechanisms.",
        "Hop 3: [Atlanta Gas Light] \u2190 [SO](2024): In 2024, Southern Company clarified that Atlanta Gas Light does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, which differentiated it from other gas distribution utilities and affected its cost recovery mechanisms."

          "chunk_text": "\nRevenues increased from rate changes in 2024 primarily due to base rate increases at the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Rate Proceedings\" for additional information.\n\nRevenues associated with gas costs and other cost recovery decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower natural gas cost recovery associated with lower natural gas prices and lower demand associated with warmer weather. The natural gas distribution utilities have weather or revenue normalization mechanisms that mitigate revenue fluctuations from customer consumption changes. Natural gas distribution rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See \"Cost of Natural G as\" herein for additional information.\n\nRevenues from gas marketing services decreased in 2024 primarily due to lower commodity prices.\n\nSouthern Company Gas has various regulatory mechanisms, such as weather and revenue normalization and straight-fixed-variable rate design, which limit its exposure to weather changes within typical ranges in each of its utility's respective service territory. Southern Company Gas also utilizes weather hedges to limit the negative income impacts in the event of warmer-than-normal weather in Illinois for gas distribution operations and in Illinois and Georgia for gas marketing services. Therefore, weather typically does not have a significant net income impact.\n\n## Cost of Natural Gas\n\nExcluding Atlanta Gas Light, which does not sell natural gas to end-use customers, the natural gas distribution utilities' rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in natural gas costs. Therefore, gas costs recovered through natural gas revenues generally equal the amount expensed in cost of natural gas and do not affect net income from the natural gas distribution utilities. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas - Natural Gas Cost Recovery\" for additional information. Cost of natural gas at the natural gas distribution utilities represented 80.3% of the total cost of natural gas for 2024.\n\nGas marketing services customers are charged for actual and estimated natural gas consumed. Cost of natural gas includes the cost of fuel and associated transportation costs, lost and unaccounted for gas, and gains and losses associated with certain derivatives.\n\nCost of natural gas was $1.2 billion, a decrease of $448 million, or 27.3%, in 2024 as compared to 2023, which reflects lower gas cost recovery in 2024 as a result of a 17.1% decrease in natural gas prices compared to 2023.\n\n## Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses\n\nOther operations and maintenance expenses decreased $40 million, or 3.1%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to prior year regulatory disallowances totaling $88 million at Nicor Gas and decreases of $12 million related to energy services contracts and $9 million in ex penses passed through to customers primarily related to bad debt and energy efficiency programs at the natural gas distribution utilities, partially offset by increases of $56 million in compensation and benefit expenses and $20 million in survey, locate, and inspection expenses for distribution gas mains. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Southern Company Gas\" for additional information.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $68 million, or 11.7%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily due to continued investments at the natural gas distribution utilities.

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\nAs part of its ongoing processes, Southern Nuclear continues to evaluate cost and schedule forecasts on a regular basis to incorporate current information available, particularly in the areas of engineering support, commodity installation, system turnovers and related test results, and workforce statistics. Southern Nuclear establishes aggressive target values for monthly construction production and system turnover activities, which are reflected in the site work plans.\n\nIn mid-March 2020, Southern Nuclear began implementing policies and procedures designed to mitigate the risk of transmission of COVID-19 at the construction site, including worker distancing measures; isolating individuals who tested positive for COVID-19, showed symptoms consistent with COVID-19, were being tested for COVID-19, or were in close contact with such persons; requiring self-quarantine; and adopting additional precautionary measures. Since March 2020, the number of active cases at the site has fluctuated consistent with the surrounding area and impacted productivity levels and pace of activity completion, with the site experiencing peaks in the number of active cases in January 2021, August 2021, and January 2022. Georgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and Unit 4. Georgia Power's proportionate share of the estimated incremental cost associated with COVID-19 mitigation actions and impacts on construction productivity is currently estimated to be between $160 million and $200 million and is included in the total project capital cost forecast. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n\nDuring 2021, Southern Nuclear performed additional construction remediation work necessary to ensure quality and design standards are met and support system turnovers necessary for Unit 3 hot functional testing, which was completed in July 2021, and fuel load. As a result of Unit 3 challenges including, but not limited to, construction productivity, construction remediation work, the pace of system turnovers, spent fuel pool repairs, and the timeframe and duration for hot functional and other testing, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established in January 2021. Through the fourth quarter 2021, the project continued to face these and other challenges related to the completion of documentation, including inspection records, necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs and begin fuel load. As a result, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan currently targets fuel load for Unit 3 in the second quarter 2022 and an in-service date during the third quarter 2022 and primarily depends on significant improvements in overall construction productivity and production levels, the volume of construction remediation work, the pace of system and area turnovers, and the progression of startup and other testing. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to these milestone dates, an in-service date during the fourth quarter 2022 or the first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 is projected, although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.\n\nAs the result of productivity challenges and temporarily diverting some Unit 4 craft and support resources to Unit 3 construction efforts, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear also further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from those established in January 2021. The temporary diversion of Unit 4 resources to support Unit 3 has continued into the first quarter 2022; therefore, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan targets an in-service date during the first quarter 2023 for Unit 4 and primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as well as appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electricians and pipefitters, being added and maintained. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to the milestone dates, an in-service date during the third or fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4 is projected, although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.\n\nDuring 2021, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $1.3 billion were assigned to the base capital cost forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, and support resources for Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power also increased its total capital cost forecast as of December 31, 2021 by $99 million to replenish construction contingency.\n\nAfter considering the significant level of uncertainty that exists regarding the future recoverability of these costs since the ultimate outcome of these matters is subject to the outcome of future assessments by management, as well as Georgia PSC decisions in future regulatory proceedings, Georgia Power recorded pre-tax charges to income in the first quarter 2021, the second quarter 2021, the third quarter 2021, and the fourth quarter 2021 of $48 million ($36 million after tax), $460 million ($343 million after tax), $264 million ($197 million after tax), and $480 million ($358 million after tax), respectively, for the increases in the total project capital cost forecast. Georgia Power may request the Georgia PSC to evaluate those expenditures for rate recovery during the prudence review following the Unit 4 fuel load pursuant to the twenty-fourth VCM stipulation described below. In addition, Georgia Power recorded a pre-tax charge to income in the fourth quarter 2021 of approximately $440 million ($328 million after tax) for incremental costs, which will not be recovered from retail customers, associated with the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described below.",

At December 31, 2021, associated project expenditures included in CWIP totaled approximately $304 million.\n\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, Alabama Power's weighted common equity return exceeded 6.15%, resulting in Alabama Power establishing a current regulatory liability of $181 million. In accordance with an Alabama PSC order issued on February 1, 2022, Alabama Power will apply $126 million to reduce the Rate ECR under recovered balance and the remaining $55 million will be refunded to customers through bill credits in July 2022.\n\nSee Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power\" for additional information.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nPlant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 Construction and Start-Up Status\n\nConstruction continues on Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 (with electric generating capacity of approximately 1,100 MWs each), in which Georgia Power holds a 45.7% ownership interest. Georgia Power's share of the total project capital cost forecast to complete Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including contingency, through the end of the first quarter 2023 and the fourth quarter 2023, respectively, is $10.4 billion.\n\nGeorgia Power estimates the productivity impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic have consumed approximately three to four months of schedule margin previously embedded in the site work plan for Unit 3 and Unit 4. The continuing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could further disrupt or delay construction and testing activities at Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n\nDuring 2021, Southern Nuclear performed additional construction remediation work necessary to ensure quality and design standards are met and support system turnovers necessary for Unit 3 hot functional testing, which was completed in July 2021, and fuel load. As a result of Unit 3 challenges including, but not limited to, construction productivity, construction remediation work, the pace of system turnovers, spent fuel pool repairs, and the timeframe and duration for hot functional and other testing, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established in January 2021. Through the fourth quarter 2021, the project continued to face these and other challenges related to the completion of documentation, including inspection records, necessary to submit the remaining ITAACs and begin fuel load. As a result, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended certain milestone dates, including fuel load for Unit 3, from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan currently targets fuel load for Unit 3 in the second quarter 2022 and an in-service date during the third quarter 2022 and primarily depends on significant improvements in overall construction productivity and production levels, the volume of construction remediation work, the pace of system and area turnovers, and the progression of startup and other testing. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to these milestone dates, an in-service date during the fourth quarter 2022 or the first quarter 2023 for Unit 3 is projected, although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.\n\nAs the result of productivity challenges and temporarily diverting some Unit 4 craft and support resources to Unit 3 construction efforts, at the end of each of the second and third quarters 2021, Southern Nuclear also further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from those established in January 2021. The temporary diversion of Unit 4 resources to support Unit 3 has continued into the first quarter 2022; therefore, at the end of the fourth quarter 2021, Southern Nuclear further extended milestone dates for Unit 4 from those established at the end of the third quarter 2021. The site work plan targets an in-service date during the first quarter 2023 for Unit 4 and primarily depends on overall construction productivity and production levels significantly improving as well as appropriate levels of craft laborers, particularly electricians and pipefitters, being added and maintained. As the site work plan includes minimal margin to the milestone dates, an in-service date during the third or fourth quarter 2023 for Unit 4 is projected, although any further delays could result in a later in-service date.\n\nThe latest schedule extension triggers the requirement that the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests in Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 must vote to continue construction by March 8, 2022. Georgia Power has voted to continue construction. In addition, if the holders of at least 90% of the ownership interests of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4 do not vote to continue construction, the DOE may require Georgia Power to prepay all outstanding borrowings under the FFB Credit Facilities over a period of five years. See Note 8 to the financial statements under \"Long-term Debt - DOE Loan Guarantee Borrowings\" for additional information.\n\nDuring 2021, established construction contingency and additional costs totaling $1.3 billion were assigned to the base capital cost forecast for costs primarily associated with schedule extensions, construction productivity, the pace of system turnovers, and support resources for Units 3 and 4. Georgia Power also increased its total capital cost forecast as of December 31, 2021 by $99 million to replenish construction contingency.",

      "question": "How did Alabama Power's 2022 long-term debt structure influence its financial flexibility to absorb potential liabilities from NEIL assessments and the AT&T pole rental dispute in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power reported total long-term debt excluding one-year maturities at $8,936 million, with senior notes at $8,725 million carrying a weighted average interest rate of 3.89%. This high level of fixed debt obligations constrained Alabama Power\u2019s financial flexibility heading into 2023, during which it faced potential liabilities including a maximum NEIL assessment of $54 million and an adverse outcome in the AT&T pole rental dispute that could have required $87 million in refunds. The combination of significant debt servicing requirements and these new contingent liabilities likely placed pressure on cash flows and limited Alabama Power\u2019s ability to absorb unexpected financial impacts without affecting its credit profile or operational investments.",

        "Hop 1: SO(2022) \u2192 Total LT Debt Excl 1Y Due: Alabama Power had $8,936 million in long-term debt excluding short-term maturities, with senior notes at $8,725 million at 3.89% interest.",
        "Hop 2: Total LT Debt Excl 1Y Due \u2192 Alabama Power: This debt structure indicates substantial fixed financial obligations and limited room for additional liabilities.",
        "Hop 3: Alabama Power \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, Alabama Power faced potential liabilities including a $54 million NEIL assessment and up to $87 million in pole rental dispute refunds, which could strain financial flexibility."

      "question": "How did Southern Company's exposure to Plant Vogtle construction risks through Georgia Power in 2022 relate to Alabama Power's maximum potential insurance assessments under NEIL policies in 2023, particularly in light of the joint railcar lease guarantees between the two subsidiaries?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company faced significant risks tied to Georgia Power's Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 construction, including uncertainties around cost recovery, legal actions, and regulatory challenges, with Deloitte conducting extensive audits to assess financial disclosures (SO_10k_2022.pdf). By 2023, Alabama Power had a maximum potential insurance assessment of $54 million under NEIL policies, while Georgia Power\u2019s was $89 million (SO_10k_2023.pdf). This indicates that although Plant Vogtle construction risks persisted, Southern Company's risk distribution across its subsidiaries evolved, with Georgia Power still bearing a larger share of insurance exposure. Additionally, the railcar lease residual guarantees between Alabama Power and Georgia Power (SO_10k_2023.pdf) suggest shared financial obligations that could amplify risk transmission between the two entities, linking 2022\u2019s construction uncertainties to 2023\u2019s insurance and lease liabilities.",

        "Hop 2: Georgia Power \u2192 Alabama Power: Georgia Power and Alabama Power were jointly involved in railcar lease residual guarantees and shared NEIL insurance policies, indicating a financial interdependence.",
        "Hop 3: Alabama Power \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, Alabama Power had a defined maximum insurance assessment of $54 million under NEIL policies, reflecting its ongoing liability exposure under Southern Company\u2019s structure."

      "answer": "In 2022, the Southern Company system's weighted average swap contract cost was $0.08 per mmBtu above market prices, but by 2023, this shifted to $0.76 per mmBtu below market prices\u2014a significant improvement in contract pricing relative to market rates. This favorable shift in swap contract cost directly contributed to the $674 million decrease in the average cost of fuel and purchased power in 2023 compared to 2022. Additionally, the Southern Company system leveraged this lower natural gas pricing to reduce both non-affiliate and affiliate purchased power expenses, with a 32.9% drop in average cost per KWH from non-affiliates and a 51.4% drop from affiliates, both attributed to lower natural gas prices. This demonstrates how the improved swap contract positioning in 2023 flowed through to reduce system-wide fuel and energy procurement costs.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSouthern Company Gas' derivative contracts are comprised of both long and short natural gas positions. A long position is a contract to purchase natural gas, and a short position is a contract to sell natural gas. The volumes presented above for Southern Company Gas represent the net of long natural gas positions of 74 million mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 6 million mmBtu at December 31, 2021 and the net of long natural gas positions of 4.42 billion mmBtu and short natural gas positions of 3.90 billion mmBtu at December 31, 2020.\n\nFor the Southern Company system, the weighted average swap contract cost per mmBtu was approximately $0.74 per mmBtu below market prices at December 31, 2021 and was equal to market prices at December 31, 2020. The change in option fair value is primarily attributable to the volatility of the market and the underlying change in the natural gas price. Substantially all of the traditional electric operating companies' natural gas hedge gains and losses are recovered through their respective fuel cost recovery clauses.\n\nThe Registrants use over-the-counter contracts that are not exchange traded but are fair valued using prices which are market observable, and thus fall into Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. In addition, Southern Company Gas uses exchange-traded marketobservable contracts, which are categorized as Level 1. See Note 13 to the financial statements for further discussion of fair value measurements. The maturities of the energy-related derivative contracts for Southern Company and Southern Company Gas at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the change in SO's gain (loss) on energy-related cash flow hedges from 2022 to 2023 impact the financial performance of Southern Company Gas, particularly in relation to natural gas cost volatility and interest expense trends?",
      "answer": "In 2022, SO reported a gain of $37 million on energy-related cash flow hedges for Southern Company Gas, which helped offset part of the $3,004 million natural gas cost. By 2023, this shifted to a loss of $44 million, coinciding with a slight increase in natural gas costs to $3,004 million and rising interest expenses from $263 million in 2022 to $310 million in 2023. This reversal from gain to loss indicates a deterioration in the effectiveness of hedging strategies, likely exacerbating the impact of higher natural gas prices and increasing interest burdens on Southern Company Gas' financial performance.",

        "Hop 2: Gain (Loss) on Energy-Related Cash Flow Hedges \u2192 Southern Company Gas: The hedging gains/losses are directly tied to Southern Company Gas' exposure to natural gas price volatility.",
        "Hop 3: Southern Company Gas \u2190 SO(2023): In 2023, Southern Company Gas experienced a $44 million loss on these hedges, while also facing higher interest expenses and sustained high natural gas costs."

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company disclosed that Alabama Power expected to utilize its federal ITC/PTC carryforwards by 2029. In 2024, Alabama Power reported $23 million in current hedging instrument liabilities and $41 million in non-current hedging instrument liabilities. The continuation of hedging activities in 2024 alongside a still-distant utilization horizon for tax credits (2029) suggests Southern Company may be using financial hedging to manage volatility while awaiting future tax credit benefits.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Southern Company Gas recorded $158 million in revenue taxes, which decreased by $29 million to $129 million in 2023. This decrease aligns with evidence showing a $60 million reduction in expenses passed through to customers, primarily related to bad debt and energy efficiency programs at gas distribution operations. The reduction in revenue taxes indicates that Southern Company Gas adjusted its tax cost recovery approach, potentially reflecting changes in tax policy or regulatory negotiations affecting how tax burdens are transferred to customers in gas distribution services.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas reported an amortization of net gain of $3 million, while in 2024, this figure increased significantly to $5 million. This increase contributed to a larger total reclassification adjustment of $11 million in 2024 for Southern Company Gas, which in turn affected the overall net regulatory asset position. Specifically, Southern Company\u2019s net regulatory liabilities for Southern Company Gas increased from $68 million at the end of 2023 to $84 million at the end of 2024, indicating a $16 million deterioration in the regulatory asset position due in part to the increased amortization of net gain.",

There are certain derivatives that could require collateral, but not accelerated payment, in the event of various credit rating changes of certain Southern Company subsidiaries. Generally, collateral may be provided by a Southern Company guaranty, letter of credit, or cash. At December 31, 2024, the Registrants had no collateral posted with derivative counterparties to satisfy these arrangements.\n\nFor Southern Company, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities and interest rate derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $72 million at December 31, 2024. For Southern Power, the fair value of foreign currency derivative liabilities with contingent features, and the max imum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, was $24 million at December 31, 2024. For the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power, energy-related derivative liabilities with contingent features and the maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the credit-risk-related contingent features, at a rating below BBB- and/or Baa3, were immaterial at December 31, 2024. The maximum potential collateral requirements arising from the creditrisk-related contingent features for the traditional electric operating companies and Southern Power include certain agreements that could require collateral in the event that one or more Southern Company power pool participants has a credit rating change to below investment grade.\n\nAlabama Power and Southern Power maintain accounts with certain regional transmission organizations to facilitate financial derivative transactions, and they may be required to post collateral based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral posted in these accounts was immaterial for Alabama Power and Southern Power. Southern Company Gas maintains accounts with brokers or the clearing houses of certain ex changes to facilitate financial derivative transactions. Based on the value of the positions in these accounts and the associated margin requirements, Southern Company Gas may be required to deposit cash into these accounts. At December 31, 2024, cash collateral held on deposit in broker margin accounts was $17 million.\n\nThe Registrants are exposed to losses related to financial instruments in the event of counterparties' nonperformance. The Registrants generally enter into agreements and material transactions with counterparties that have investment grade credit ratings by Moody's, S&amp;P, or Fitch or with counterparties who have posted collateral to cover potential credit ex posure. The Registrants have also established risk management policies and controls to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties in order to mitigate their ex posure to counterparty credit risk.\n\nSouthern Company Gas uses established credit policies to determine and monitor the creditworthiness of counterparties, including requirements to post collateral or other credit security, as well as the quality of pledged collateral. Collateral or credit security is most often in the form of cash or letters of credit from an investmentgrade financial institution, but may also include cash or U.S. government securities held by a trustee. Prior to entering a physical transaction, Southern Company Gas assigns its counterparties an internal credit rating and credit limit based on the counterparties' Moody's, S&amp;P, and Fitch ratings, commercially available credit reports, and audited financial statements. Southern Company Gas may require counterparties to pledge additional collateral when deemed necessary.\n\nSouthern Company Gas utilizes netting agreements whenever possible to mitigate exposure to counterparty credit risk. Netting agreements enable Southern Company Gas to net certain assets and liabilities by counterparty across product lines and against",

      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant uncertainties regarding the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, as evidenced by the extensive audit procedures conducted by Deloitte, including inquiries into construction status, regulatory filings, legal risks, and NRC licensing reviews. These uncertainties were tied to the potential for incomplete cost recovery due to project risks. By 2023, Georgia Power's 'Other Deferred Charges and Assets'\u2014a line item reflecting such deferrals\u2014decreased from $56 million to $29 million. This reduction suggests that some of the previously deferred costs may have been resolved or written down, potentially reflecting progress in construction or regulatory decisions that clarified the likelihood of cost recovery. However, the continued disclosure of deferred charges in 2023 indicates that some uncertainties remained, albeit at a reduced level, showing an evolution in the risk profile associated with Plant Vogtle.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in Southern Company Gas's natural gas options hedge volume from 102 million mmBtu in 2023 to 83 million mmBtu in 2024 impact its earnings sensitivity to gas price volatility compared to the broader Southern Company portfolio?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Southern Company Gas had a total natural gas options hedge volume of 102 million mmBtu, which dropped to 83 million mmBtu by the end of 2024. This 19 million mmBtu decrease suggests a reduced hedging position, potentially increasing earnings sensitivity to gas price volatility. Meanwhile, the broader Southern Company increased its natural gas options hedge volume from 339 million mmBtu in 2023 to 431 million mmBtu in 2024, indicating a more aggressive risk management approach in other segments. This divergence implies that Southern Company Gas may have adjusted its hedging strategy to either reflect more stable gas price expectations or to allow for greater market exposure, which could increase earnings variability in the gas segment relative to the rest of the company.",

      "question": "How did the financial disclosure practices around Georgia Power's ownership stake in Plant Hatch evolve from Southern Company's 2022 filing to its 2024 filing, and what does this imply about the company's transparency regarding nuclear assets?",
      "answer": "In Southern Company's 2022 filing, Georgia Power's ownership stake in Plant Hatch was disclosed with specific financial figures of $757 million in 2021 and $716 million in 2020. The 2022 filing also provided detailed context around asset retirement obligations tied to Plant Hatch as part of Georgia Power's nuclear decommissioning liabilities. However, by the 2024 filing, there was no updated financial disclosure or specific mention of Plant Hatch in relation to Georgia Power, with Georgia Power only being referenced in a procedural context as a subsidiary under corporate governance documentation. This indicates a decreased emphasis on transparency around nuclear asset valuations and liabilities, suggesting a shift in disclosure strategy rather than a change in operational or ownership structure.",

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance from its state PSC or applicable state regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory assets.\n\nThe ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" herein for additional information. Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to its solar and wind facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the restoration of land at the end of the lease.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.\n\nSouthern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.\n\nDetails of the AROs included in the balance sheets are as follows:\n\n",

By 2024, Georgia Power remained one of SO's key operating subsidiaries, as evidenced by its inclusion in the Power of Attorney and resolution documents, continuing its role as operator and maintainer of jointly-owned facilities like Plant Hatch. This indicates that while the financial value of Plant Hatch likely evolved between 2022 and 2024, Georgia Power maintained its central operational responsibility, suggesting strategic continuity in how SO manages nuclear assets through its subsidiaries despite potential financial or ownership adjustments.",

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's 2023 revenue strategy for its natural gas and infrastructure segment (GU&I) influence its 2024 financial commitments for Piedmont, particularly in terms of performance obligations extending through 2029?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy's 2023 revenue strategy for the GU&I segment, which emphasized disaggregated revenue reporting to better align with customer expectations, regulatory structures, and economic factors (chunk 1), directly informed resource allocation and planning decisions. Since GU&I includes Piedmont\u2014a natural gas distribution business (chunk 2)\u2014this strategic revenue focus led to increased visibility and planning around long-term commitments. By 2024, this translated into specific performance obligations for Piedmont totaling $405 million across 2025\u20132029, with $64 million committed for 2025 alone (chunk 3). The evolution from strategic insight in 2023 to financial planning in 2024 demonstrates a clear causal chain through the GU&I segment to Piedmont.",

      "question": "How did the financial relationship between Duke Energy Florida's segment performance and its noncurrent pension liability evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of the reported liability values?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Duke Energy Florida reported a noncurrent pension liability of $45 million, as disclosed in the financial statements. By 2024, this liability for the Florida segment was no longer present, as the company reported a net asset position of $247 million, which included prefunded pension assets. This indicates a significant shift in the pension funding strategy, transforming the segment's pension position from a liability to a prefunded asset over the two-year period.",

        "Hop 1: DUK(2022) \u2192 Florida Segment: In 2022, Duke Energy Florida had $50 million in cash and cash equivalents, indicating its segment-level financial position.",

        "Hop 3: Noncurrent Pension Liability \u2190 DUK(2024): By 2024, Duke Energy Florida no longer had a pension liability, instead reporting $247 million in prefunded pension assets."

      "question": "How did Georgia Power's uncertainties around Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 cost recovery in 2022 impact their 2024 capital expenditure strategy, particularly the $1.0 billion allocated to General Plant investments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Georgia Power faced significant scrutiny and uncertainties regarding the cost recovery of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4, including regulatory monitoring, potential legal actions, and risks tied to construction delays and cost overruns (SO_10k_2022.pdf:page_129:chunk_1). By 2024, Georgia Power had allocated $8.6 billion in total capital expenditures, of which $1.0 billion was directed toward General Plant (SO_10k_2024.pdf:page_14:chunk_2). This allocation suggests a recalibration of capital priorities, with General Plant investment representing a more established and potentially lower-risk asset category compared to the ongoing nuclear expansion. The continued investment in General Plant amid earlier uncertainties may reflect a strategic effort to maintain operational stability and diversify capital deployment across asset classes.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Alabama Power's prior service cost liability was part of Southern Company's broader pension obligations, though specific figures for Alabama Power alone were not explicitly broken out. By 2024, Alabama Power's prior service cost liability was reported at $3 million, down from $4 million in 2023. This reduction indicates a gradual amortization or strategic management of legacy pension costs across the Southern Company subsidiaries. The decrease in Alabama Power\u2019s share of the prior service cost aligns with Southern Company's broader trend of reducing total regulatory assets (liabilities) from $(48 million) in 2023 to $(45 million) in 2024 for Alabama Power, suggesting a focused effort to manage long-term employee benefit liabilities.",

By 2024, Georgia Power remained a key subsidiary under Southern Company, as evidenced by the continued use of corporate resolutions and powers of attorney, indicating ongoing strategic oversight. The evolution of the relationship shows Southern Company maintaining governance control over Georgia Power while managing long-term nuclear asset liabilities that originated in earlier reporting periods. This reflects a stable corporate structure with sustained financial commitments to aging nuclear infrastructure.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.\n\nGiven the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)\n\nThe consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.\n\nSouthern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.\n\nCurrent and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.\n\nGiven the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)\n\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.\n\nThe ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property",

The majority of the Registrants' fuel expense for the periods presented was purchased under long-term commitments. Each Registrant expects that a substantial amount of its future fuel needs will continue to be purchased under long-term commitments.\n\nGeorgia Power has commitments, in the form of capacity purchases, regarding a portion of a 5% interest in the original cost of Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 owned by MEAG Power that are in effect until the later of the retirement of the plant or the latest stated maturity date of MEAG Power's bonds issued to finance such ownership interest. The payments for capacity are required whether or not any capacity is available. Portions of the capacity payments made to MEAG Power for its Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 investment relate to costs in excess of Georgia Power's allowed investment for ratemaking purposes. The present value of these portions at the time of the disallowance was written off. Generally, the cost of such capacity is included in purchased power in Southern Company's statements of income and in purchased power, non-affiliates in Georgia Power's statements of income. Georgia Power's capacity payments related to this commitment totaled $6 million, $5 million, and $6 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, Georgia Power's estimated long-term obligations related to this commitment totaled $42 million, consisting of $4 million for 2022, $3 million annually for 2023 through 2025, $1 million for 2026, and $28 million thereafter.\n\nSee Note 9 for information regarding PPAs accounted for as leases.\n\nSouthern Company Gas has commitments for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply, including charges recoverable through natural gas cost recovery mechanisms or, alternatively, billed to marketers selling retail natural gas. Gas supply commitments include amounts for gas commodity purchases associated with Nicor Gas and SouthStar of 56 million mmBtu at floating gas prices calculated using forward natural gas prices at December 31, 2021 and valued at $222 million. Southern Company Gas provides guarantees to certain gas suppliers for certain of its subsidiaries in support of payment obligations. Southern Company Gas' expected future contractual obligations for pipeline charges, storage capacity, and gas supply that are not recognized on the balance sheets at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n\n",

This mirrors the broader company trend, where the total noncurrent post-retirement liability for Duke Energy decreased from $179 million in 2023 to $165 million in 2024. The alignment between the Ohio segment and the overall company suggests a consistent strategy of managing pension and post-retirement liabilities, potentially through benefit adjustments, funding improvements, or workforce restructuring.",

      "question": "How did the financial risk exposure of Georgia Power in 2023, particularly under the NEIL insurance policies, influence the strategic decisions regarding Plant Scherer's operational lifespan and environmental upgrades in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power faced a maximum annual retrospective assessment of $89 million under NEIL insurance policies, which could have significantly impacted its financial stability in the event of a nuclear incident. This risk exposure likely contributed to Georgia Power's cautious approach to long-term investments in aging coal plants like Plant Scherer. By 2024, Georgia Power requested an extension of Plant Scherer Unit 3\u2019s operation through at least December 31, 2035, and proposed environmental upgrades for multiple units at the plant to comply with new regulations. These actions indicate a strategic shift toward extending the life of key assets while managing risk through compliance and modernization, balancing the need for continued generation capacity with the financial constraints posed by insurance liabilities and regulatory pressures.",

In the 2023 IRP Update decision, the Georgia PSC approved the following requests:\n\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates with the recoverable costs not to exceed the certified amount, which was approved by the Georgia PSC on August 20, 2024. With this approval, the Georgia PSC recognized the potential for circumstances beyond Georgia Power's control that could cause the project costs to exceed the certified amount, in which case Georgia Power would provide documentation to the Georgia PSC to explain and justify potential recovery of additional reasonable and prudent costs. Georgia Power is required to file semiannual construction monitoring reports with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation, the first of which was filed on February 14, 2025.\n- Certification of an affiliate PPA with Mississippi Power for 750 MWs, which began January 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Certification of a non-affiliate PPA for 230 MWs, which began May 1, 2024 and will continue through December 2028.\n- Authority to develop, own, and operate up to 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities, including storage systems co-located with existing Georgia Powerowned solar facilities with the recoverable costs not to ex ceed the certified amount, as approved by the Georgia PSC on December 3, 2024, as well as the issuance of an expedited RFP for an additional 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities. Georgia Power is required to file quarterly construction monitoring reports for Georgia Power-owned resources with the Georgia PSC through commercial operation.\n- Approval of transmission projects necessary to support the generation resources approved in the 2023 IRP Update.\n\nThe 2023 IRP Update assumed a retirement date at the end of 2035 for Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 (1,400 MWs). See \"2025 IRP\" herein for additional information.\n\nOn January 12, 2024, Georgia Power entered into an agreement for engineering, procurement, and construction to construct three 442-MW simple cycle combustion turbine units at Plant Y ates (Plant Y ates Units 8, 9, and 10), which are projected to be placed in service in the fourth quarter 2026, the second quarter 2027, and the third quarter 2027, respectively.\n\nIn the third quarter 2024, G eorgia Power entered into agreements for engineering, procurement, and construction of four battery energy storage facilities totaling 500 MWs, which are projected to be placed in service in 2026.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Georgia Power had recorded approximately $760 million of combined capital costs, excluding AFUDC, for the 265-MW battery energy storage facility approved in the 2022 IRP, the 500 MWs of battery energy storage facilities approved in the 2023 IRP Update, and the 1,400 MWs from three simple cycle combustion turbines at Plant Yates approved in the 2023 IRP Update. The total certified amounts related to these projects are approximately $2.8 billion, excluding AFUDC.\n\nThe ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be determined at this time.\n\n## 2025 IRP\n\nOn January 31, 2025, Georgia Power filed its triennial IRP (2025 IRP). The filing includes a request to ex tend the operation of Plant Scherer Unit 3 (614 MWs based on 75% ownership) through at least December 31, 2035 and Plant Gaston Units 1 through 4 (500 MWs based on 50% ownership through SEGCO) through at least December 31, 2034. See Note 7 under \"SEGCO\" for additional information.\n\nAs in the 2023 IRP Update, Plant Bowen Units 1 and 2 are also assumed to operate through at least the end of 2035.\n\nIn addition, the 2025 IRP includes, among other things, requests for approval of the following:\n\n- Pursuit of installation of environmental controls and natural gas co-firing at Plant Bowen Units 1 through 4 (3,160 MWs), Plant Scherer Units 1 and 2 (137 MWs based on 8.4% ownership), and Plant Scherer Unit 3 for compliance with both ELG supplemental rules and GHG rules.\n- Upgrades to Plant McIntosh Units 10 and 11 (1,319 MWs) for a projected 194 MWs of incremental capacity by 2028 and Plant McIntosh Units 1 through 8 (640 MWs) for a projected 74 MWs of incremental capacity by 2033.\n- Upgrades to Plant Hatch Units 1 and 2 (900 MWs based on 50.1% ownership) and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 (1,060 MWs based on 45.7% ownership) for a projected 112 MWs of incremental capacity, some of which would be available as early as 2028.\n- Investments related to the continued reliable hydro operations of nine facilities, as well as the authority to develop, own, and operate a projected incremental 16 MWs from Plant Goat Rock Units 3 through 6.\n- RFPs for at least 1,100 MWs of utility scale and distributed generation renewable resources. Georgia Power is seeking to add up to 4,000 MWs of incremental renewable resources by 2035.\n- Issuance of a capacity RFP to procure resources to meet capacity needs in 2032 and 2033.",

      "question": "Given Southern Company's exposure to significant nuclear insurance liabilities and legal risks affecting Alabama Power's financial position in 2023, how did the unchanged 4.60% annual salary increase assumption in 2024 impact pension liability estimates for Alabama Power employees, and what does this imply about Southern Company's long-term benefit obligation modeling under continued financial pressures?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Alabama Power faced material financial risks from potential nuclear insurance assessments up to $54 million and ongoing legal uncertainties regarding pole rental agreements. Despite these pressures, Alabama Power maintained the same 4.60% annual salary increase assumption for pension benefits in 2024, consistent with Southern Company's broader pension planning framework. This static assumption suggests Southern Company and its subsidiaries are projecting stable wage growth in pension liability calculations, even amid financial risks that could affect cash flow and benefit funding capabilities. The continued use of this assumption implies confidence in long-term financial stability or a strategic decision to prioritize pension obligations despite external liabilities.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Georgia Power had a maximum annual decommissioning cost of $89 million under NEIL policies due to potential nuclear incidents, which could have significantly impacted Southern Company's financial condition if insurance proceeds were inadequate. By 2024, Georgia Power had no annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking for Plant Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 and 2, with any required funding deferred to a regulatory asset. This shift suggests Southern Company transitioned from direct cost recovery to a deferred cost recovery model, likely to manage financial volatility from nuclear risk while maintaining compliance with NRC requirements. The removal of direct decommissioning cost from ratemaking in 2024 contrasts with the earlier year's exposure, indicating a strategic realignment in how nuclear liabilities are managed and funded.",

Significant assumptions used to determine these costs for ratemaking were an estimated inflation rate of 4.5% for Plant Farley, 2.5% for Plants Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and 2.3% for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and an estimated trust earnings rate of 7.0% for Plant Farley, 4.5% for Plants Hatch and Vogtle Units 1 and 2, and 4.3% for Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.\n\nAmounts previously contributed to the Funds for Plant Farley are currently projected to be adequate to meet the decommissioning obligations. Alabama Power's sitespecific estimates of decommissioning costs for Plant Farley are updated every five years. The next site study for Alabama Power is expected to be completed in 2028. Projections of funds are reviewed with the Alabama PSC to ensure that, over time, the deposits and earnings of the Funds will provide adequate funding to cover the site-specific costs. If necessary, Alabama Power would seek the Alabama PSC's approval to address any changes in a manner consistent with NRC and other applicable requirements.\n\nUnder the 2019 ARP, Georgia Power's annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking in 2022 was a total of $4 million for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Effective January 1, 2023, as approved in the 2022 ARP, there is no annual decommissioning cost for ratemaking for Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2. Any funding amount required by the NRC during the period covered by the 2022 ARP will be deferred to a regulatory asset and recovery is expected to be determined in Georgia Power's next base rate case. See Note 2 under \"Georgia Power - Rate Plans - 2022 ARP\" for additional information.",
