This consistent downward trend indicates a strategic shift toward reducing new investment commitments and potentially reallocating capital toward other priorities such as acquisitions, debt reduction, or shareholder returns.",

      "answer": "The financial impact of 'Decrease related to resolutions of audits with tax authorities' for HON increased significantly over the three-year period: $1 million in 2022, $132 million in 2023, and $31 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a sharp spike in audit resolutions during 2023, followed by a notable decline in 2024, suggesting a possible resolution of major outstanding audit issues in 2023 that reduced exposure in subsequent periods.",

      "answer": "In 2022, HON reported a gross decrease of $19 million related to prior periods' tax positions. This value was $0 in 2023, indicating no such decreases were recorded during that year. By 2024, the company reported a decrease of $17 million related to prior periods' tax positions. The pattern\u2014starting with a moderate decrease in 2022, followed by no decrease in 2023, and then a significant decrease in 2024\u2014suggests that the resolution of historical tax uncertainties was intermittent but active over the three-year period, with the most notable progress occurring in 2024.",

      "answer": "The tax benefit decreases related to audit resolutions increased significantly over the three-year period, rising from $1 million in 2022 to $132 million in 2023, and then declining to $31 million in 2024. This indicates a sharp spike in audit-related settlements in 2023, followed by a notable reduction in 2024, suggesting a period of heightened tax authority scrutiny in 2023 that subsequently eased.",

      "answer": "In 2022, HON reported gross increases related to prior period tax positions of $31 million. This figure rose sharply to $181 million in 2023, before dropping significantly to just $12 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a substantial upward adjustment in prior-year tax liabilities during 2023, potentially signaling audit resolutions or reassessments of past tax filings. The steep decline in 2024 suggests that these adjustments were largely addressed or finalized, reflecting a stabilization in tax position disclosures.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, FedEx's pension amendments had a fluctuating but minimal direct impact on its total MTM loss or gain. In 2022, pension amendments contributed a $87 reduction to the MTM loss, helping offset larger losses from discount rate changes. In 2023 and 2024, the impact of pension amendments was negligible, contributing only $1 each year to the MTM outcome. This progression shows that while pension amendments were used as a strategic tool to manage liabilities in 2022, they played a much smaller role in subsequent years as other actuarial factors dominated the MTM volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [FDX](2022) \u2192 [Pension Amendments]: Pension plan amendments contributed a $87 reduction to the total MTM loss in 2022, indicating active pension liability management.",
        "Hop 2: [FDX](2023) \u2192 [Pension Amendments]: Pension amendments contributed only $1 to the MTM outcome in 2023, showing a significant reduction in strategic pension adjustments.",
        "Hop 3: [FDX](2024) \u2192 [Pension Amendments]: Pension amendments again contributed only $1 in 2024, confirming that pension strategy adjustments had largely ceased after the initial actions in 2022."

      "answer": "FDX's allocation to mortgage-backed and other fixed-income securities increased in the U.S. pension plan from $1,065 million in 2022 to $1,386 million in 2023 and remained at that level in 2024, indicating a growing emphasis on this asset class within the U.S. plan. In contrast, the international pension plan saw a decline in this allocation from $217 million in 2022 to an unspecified amount in 2023 (implied reduction) and no mention in 2024, suggesting a strategic shift away from this asset class in international markets. This divergence reveals a nuanced investment strategy where FDX increased exposure in its domestic plan while reducing it internationally over the three-year period.",

      "answer": "The financial impact of pension plan amendments, including curtailment gains, was -$87 million in 2022, $1 million in 2023, and remained at $1 million in 2024. This represents a significant shift from a net cost to a neutral position, indicating a stabilization in FDX's pension strategy following the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands pension plan in 2022.",

        "Hop 1: [FDX](2023) \u2192 [Pension Amendments]: Financial impact was $1 million in 2023, showing a neutral position compared to the prior year.",
        "Hop 2: [FDX](2024) \u2192 [Pension Amendments]: Financial impact remained unchanged at $1 million in 2024, indicating sustained stabilization.",
        "Hop 3: [FDX](2022) \u2192 [Pension Amendments]: Financial impact was -$87 million in 2022, reflecting a significant cost related to pension amendments and curtailment gains, including the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands pension plan which contributed $224 million in gains."

      "answer": "FedEx's proceeds from stock issuances increased from $184 million in fiscal 2022 to $231 million in fiscal 2023, and further to $491 million in fiscal 2024, indicating a significant escalation in equity financing. This upward trajectory suggests a strategic shift toward raising capital through stock issuance, particularly in fiscal 2024, which may reflect the company's response to financial pressures or strategic investment needs.",

This consistent downward trend indicates that GE has been actively reducing its long-term employee obligations, likely as part of broader restructuring and divestiture strategies during this period.",

      "answer": "GE's 'All other assets' within discontinued operations declined significantly from $2,109 million in 2022 to $200 million in 2023, before rising to $13,910 million in 2024. This reflects a major asset reduction in 2023 consistent with divestiture activity, followed by a substantial increase in 2024 that suggests either new assets being classified as held for sale or revaluation of existing assets, indicating a dynamic restructuring process.",

      "question": "How did GE's use of financing discounts for equipment sold in conjunction with long-term service agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's strategy in securing long-term service revenue commitments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE explicitly mentioned offering financing discounts for equipment sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements, with these sales accounted for as financing arrangements when payments were collected through higher usage-based fees. In 2023, this disclosure was reiterated, showing continued strategic use of financing discounts to incentivize long-term service commitments. By 2024, GE maintained this disclosure language, but within the context of a restructured organization post the GE Vernova and GE Healthcare spin-offs, suggesting a consistent strategy focused on Aviation and Defense service contracts. The consistent mention of financing discounts across all three years indicates a sustained effort to bundle equipment financing with long-term service agreements to secure recurring revenue streams.",

Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for earnings from continuing operations, earnings from discontinued operations and net earnings. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total. Unless otherwise indicated, information in these notes to consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Certain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or spun-off. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nCONSOLIDATION. Our financial statements consolidate all of our affiliates, entities where we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest, or where we are required to apply the variable interest entity (VIE) model because we have the power to direct the most economically significant activities of entities. We reevaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in all entities when our rights and interests change.\n\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time. We recognize revenue on agreements for the sale of customized goods including power generation equipment, long-term construction projects and military development contracts on an over-time basis as we customize the customer's equipment during the manufacturing or integration process and obtain right to payment for work performed.\n\nWe recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method, which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Our estimate of costs to be incurred to fulfill our promise to a customer is based on our history of manufacturing or constructing similar assets for customers and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or pricing of the inputs. We provide for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.\n\nOur billing terms for these over-time contracts are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time. We recognize revenue on agreements for non-customized equipment including commercial aircraft engines, healthcare equipment and other goods we manufacture on a standardized basis for sale to the market at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (i.e., time between shipment and delivery).\n\nWhere arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not provide for anticipated losses on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.\n\nOur billing terms for these point-in-time equipment contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer; however, within certain businesses, we receive progress collections from customers for large equipment purchases, to generally reserve production slots.\n\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF SERVICES. Consistent with our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) discussion and the way we manage our businesses, we refer to sales under service agreements, which includes both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs) as sales of 'services,' which is an important part of our operations. We sometimes offer our customers financing discounts for the purchase of certain equipment when sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements. These sales are accounted for as financing arrangements when payments for the equipment are collected through higher usage-based fees from servicing the equipment. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time. We enter into long-term service agreements with our customers primarily within our Aviation and Power segments. These agreements require us to provide preventative maintenance, overhauls, and standby \"warrantytype\" services that include certain levels of assurance regarding asset performance and uptime throughout the contract periods, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision (e.g., equipment upgrade).\n\nWe recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Throughout the life of a contract, this measure of progress captures the nature, timing and extent of our underlying performance activities as our stand-ready services often fluctuate between routine inspections and maintenance, unscheduled service events and major overhauls at pre-determined usage intervals. We provide for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.\n\nOur billing terms for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) or upon the occurrence of a major maintenance event within the contract, such as an overhaul. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions.

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GA A P), which requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements. A lthough our current estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets, contract assets and investment securities, revisions to estimated profitability on long-term product service agreements, incremental credit losses on receivables and debt securities, incremental losses related to our contingencies, a change in the carrying amount of our tax assets and liabilities, or a change in our insurance liabilities and pension obligations as of the time of a relevant measurement event.\n\nIn preparing our Statement of Cash Flows, we make certain adjustments to reflect cash flows that cannot otherwise be calculated by changes in our Statement of Financial Position. These adjustments may include, but are not limited to, the effects of currency exchange, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, businesses classified as held for sale, the timing of settlements to suppliers for property, plant and equipment, non-cash gains/losses and other balance sheet reclassifications.\n\nWe have reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year's presentation. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for earnings from continuing operations, earnings from discontinued operations and net earnings. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total. Unless otherwise indicated, information in these notes to consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Certain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or spun-off.\n\nOn April 2, 2024 and January 3, 2023, General Electric Company, now operating as GE A erospace, completed the previously announced separation of GE Vernova and its separation of GE HealthCare, respectively, which resulted in three independent, publicly traded companies - GE A erospace, GE V ernova and GE HealthCare. We are organized into two business segments that are aligned with the industries we serve: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies. The historical results of GE V ernova and GE HealthCare are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. See Notes 2 and 25 for further information.\n\nCONSOLIDATION. Our financial statements consolidate all of our affiliates, entities where we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest, or where we are required to apply the variable interest entity (V IE) model and we have the power to direct the most economically significant activities of entities. We reev aluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in all entities when our rights and interests change. A ll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. We recognize revenue for equipment including commercial install and spare aircraft engines, defense aircraft engines, and other products we manufacture at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).\n\nWhere arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment, and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not provide for anticipated losses on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.\n\nOur billing terms for these contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer. We sometimes offer our customers financing discounts for the purchase of certain equipment when sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements. These sales are accounted for as financing arrangements when payments for the equipment are collected through higher usage-based fees from servicing the equipment. In some contracts, we receive progress collections from customers for large equipment purchases. Progress collections are not considered a significant financing component as they are used to meet working capital demands and protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. For certain commercial engine programs, we make payments to airlines when the aircraft with our engines are delivered by the airframers (aircraft allowances). We record aircraft allowances as a reduction in revenue when control of the engine is transferred to our airframer customer.\n\nSome of our contracts require us to make payments to customers related to failure to deliver our equipment on-time or meeting certain performance specifications, which is factored into our estimate of variable consideration using the expected value method taking into consideration performance relative to our contractual obligations, specified liquidated damages rates, if applicable, and history of paying damages to the customer or similar customers.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF SERVICES. Spare Parts. We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services businesses. We recognize revenue and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is when we deliver the spare part to the customer. In some cases, our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the form of volume or product durability discounts, which we incorporate into our estimate of transaction price using the expected value method. Delivery is measured using either proof of delivery or estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).",

This consistent downward trend indicates that GE has been actively reducing its long-term employee obligations, likely as part of broader restructuring and divestiture strategies during its transformation phase.",

      "answer": "GE's 'All other assets' value declined from $2,109 million in 2022 to $200 million in 2023, before surging to $13,910 million in 2024. This trajectory reflects a significant asset reduction in 2023 consistent with portfolio streamlining, followed by a notable increase in 2024, potentially signaling a strategic shift or reclassification of assets amid ongoing restructuring.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE(2022) \u2192 All other assets: GE reported 'All other assets' at $2,109 million as part of its discontinued operations disclosures.",
        "Hop 2: GE(2023) \u2192 All other assets: The value of 'All other assets' dropped sharply to $200 million, indicating a major reduction or reclassification likely tied to asset divestitures.",
        "Hop 3: GE(2024) \u2192 All other assets: 'All other assets' surged to $13,910 million, suggesting either a reversal of prior reductions, a reclassification of other asset categories, or new strategic holdings."

      "question": "How did GE's use of financing discounts for equipment sold in conjunction with long-term service agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's strategy in Aerospace and Power segments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE disclosed that it sometimes offered customers financing discounts for equipment sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements, with payments collected through higher usage-based fees. By 2023, this practice remained consistent, with GE continuing to account for these arrangements as financing arrangements, indicating ongoing strategic alignment in its Aerospace and Power segments. In 2024, GE reaffirmed this approach, explicitly noting that progress collections were used to meet working capital demands and protect against customer default, suggesting a more risk-aware application of financing discounts in a post-spinoff environment. The consistent use of financing discounts across all three years reflects GE\u2019s strategic emphasis on long-term service contracts to secure recurring revenue, with 2024 showing a more refined approach to managing financial exposure.",

        "Hop 3: [GE](2024) \u2192 [Financing Discounts]: Clarified that progress collections were used to meet working capital needs and protect against customer default, indicating a more strategic and risk-aware application post-spinoff of GE Vernova and GE Healthcare."

          "chunk_text": "We have reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year's presentation. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for earnings from continuing operations, earnings from discontinued operations and net earnings. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total. Unless otherwise indicated, information in these notes to consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Certain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or spun-off. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nCONSOLIDATION. Our financial statements consolidate all of our affiliates, entities where we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest, or where we are required to apply the variable interest entity (VIE) model because we have the power to direct the most economically significant activities of entities. We reevaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in all entities when our rights and interests change.\n\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time. We recognize revenue on agreements for the sale of customized goods including power generation equipment, long-term construction projects and military development contracts on an over-time basis as we customize the customer's equipment during the manufacturing or integration process and obtain right to payment for work performed.\n\nWe recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method, which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Our estimate of costs to be incurred to fulfill our promise to a customer is based on our history of manufacturing or constructing similar assets for customers and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or pricing of the inputs. We provide for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.\n\nOur billing terms for these over-time contracts are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time. We recognize revenue on agreements for non-customized equipment including commercial aircraft engines, healthcare equipment and other goods we manufacture on a standardized basis for sale to the market at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (i.e., time between shipment and delivery).\n\nWhere arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not provide for anticipated losses on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.\n\nOur billing terms for these point-in-time equipment contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer; however, within certain businesses, we receive progress collections from customers for large equipment purchases, to generally reserve production slots.\n\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF SERVICES. Consistent with our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) discussion and the way we manage our businesses, we refer to sales under service agreements, which includes both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs) as sales of 'services,' which is an important part of our operations. We sometimes offer our customers financing discounts for the purchase of certain equipment when sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements. These sales are accounted for as financing arrangements when payments for the equipment are collected through higher usage-based fees from servicing the equipment. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time. We enter into long-term service agreements with our customers primarily within our Aviation and Power segments. These agreements require us to provide preventative maintenance, overhauls, and standby \"warrantytype\" services that include certain levels of assurance regarding asset performance and uptime throughout the contract periods, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision (e.g., equipment upgrade).\n\nWe recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Throughout the life of a contract, this measure of progress captures the nature, timing and extent of our underlying performance activities as our stand-ready services often fluctuate between routine inspections and maintenance, unscheduled service events and major overhauls at pre-determined usage intervals. We provide for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.\n\nOur billing terms for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) or upon the occurrence of a major maintenance event within the contract, such as an overhaul. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions.

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GA A P), which requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements. A lthough our current estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets, contract assets and investment securities, revisions to estimated profitability on long-term product service agreements, incremental credit losses on receivables and debt securities, incremental losses related to our contingencies, a change in the carrying amount of our tax assets and liabilities, or a change in our insurance liabilities and pension obligations as of the time of a relevant measurement event.\n\nIn preparing our Statement of Cash Flows, we make certain adjustments to reflect cash flows that cannot otherwise be calculated by changes in our Statement of Financial Position. These adjustments may include, but are not limited to, the effects of currency exchange, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, businesses classified as held for sale, the timing of settlements to suppliers for property, plant and equipment, non-cash gains/losses and other balance sheet reclassifications.\n\nWe have reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year's presentation. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for earnings from continuing operations, earnings from discontinued operations and net earnings. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total. Unless otherwise indicated, information in these notes to consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Certain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or spun-off.\n\nOn April 2, 2024 and January 3, 2023, General Electric Company, now operating as GE A erospace, completed the previously announced separation of GE Vernova and its separation of GE HealthCare, respectively, which resulted in three independent, publicly traded companies - GE A erospace, GE V ernova and GE HealthCare. We are organized into two business segments that are aligned with the industries we serve: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies. The historical results of GE V ernova and GE HealthCare are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. See Notes 2 and 25 for further information.\n\nCONSOLIDATION. Our financial statements consolidate all of our affiliates, entities where we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest, or where we are required to apply the variable interest entity (V IE) model and we have the power to direct the most economically significant activities of entities. We reev aluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in all entities when our rights and interests change. A ll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. We recognize revenue for equipment including commercial install and spare aircraft engines, defense aircraft engines, and other products we manufacture at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).\n\nWhere arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment, and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not provide for anticipated losses on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.\n\nOur billing terms for these contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer. We sometimes offer our customers financing discounts for the purchase of certain equipment when sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements. These sales are accounted for as financing arrangements when payments for the equipment are collected through higher usage-based fees from servicing the equipment. In some contracts, we receive progress collections from customers for large equipment purchases. Progress collections are not considered a significant financing component as they are used to meet working capital demands and protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. For certain commercial engine programs, we make payments to airlines when the aircraft with our engines are delivered by the airframers (aircraft allowances). We record aircraft allowances as a reduction in revenue when control of the engine is transferred to our airframer customer.\n\nSome of our contracts require us to make payments to customers related to failure to deliver our equipment on-time or meeting certain performance specifications, which is factored into our estimate of variable consideration using the expected value method taking into consideration performance relative to our contractual obligations, specified liquidated damages rates, if applicable, and history of paying damages to the customer or similar customers.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF SERVICES. Spare Parts. We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services businesses. We recognize revenue and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is when we deliver the spare part to the customer. In some cases, our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the form of volume or product durability discounts, which we incorporate into our estimate of transaction price using the expected value method. Delivery is measured using either proof of delivery or estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).",

      "question": "How did GE's 'All other liabilities' evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this 3-year trajectory reveal about the company's liability management in the context of its discontinued operations and broader balance sheet restructuring?",
      "answer": "GE's 'All other liabilities' decreased consistently over the three-year period: from $13,240 million in 2022, to $1,125 million in 2023, and then to $6,376 million in 2024. This trajectory reveals a significant restructuring of liabilities, especially in 2023, likely tied to the divestiture and reclassification of major portions of discontinued operations. The rebound in 2024 suggests stabilization in core liabilities outside of discontinued operations, indicating a phased liability management strategy.",

        "Hop 1: GE(2022) \u2192 All other liabilities: Discloses $13,240 million in 'All other liabilities' related to discontinued operations.",

      "answer": "GE's insurance liabilities and annuity benefits were $37,166 million in 2022, decreased slightly to $376 million in 2023 (specifically for businesses held for sale), and then rose to $36,209 million in 2024. This indicates that while the company reduced some liabilities during its divestiture activities in 2023, it still maintained a significant level of long-term obligations by 2024, suggesting ongoing exposure to insurance-related risks despite strategic restructuring.",

      "question": "How did the discount rate applied to benefit obligations under U.S. Plans evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trend suggest about Emerson's (EMR) pension liability assumptions in a rising interest rate environment?",
      "answer": "The discount rate applied to benefit obligations under U.S. Plans increased from 5.64% in 2022 to 6.03% in 2023, then dropped to 4.97% in 2024. This pattern reflects a short-term upward adjustment in valuation assumptions likely in response to rising market interest rates, followed by a reversal in 2024 that may indicate a recalibration of long-term liability expectations or changes in plan structure. The volatility across the three years suggests Emerson's pension assumptions are sensitive to macroeconomic conditions and evolving actuarial judgments.",

      "answer": "Emerson Electric's Total Accumulated Benefit Obligation (TABO) decreased from $5,634 in fiscal year 2021 (reported in 2022) to $3,719 in fiscal year 2023, and then slightly increased to $3,942 in fiscal year 2024. This indicates a significant liability reduction in 2023 driven by rising discount rates, followed by a modest rebound in 2024 as discount rates declined. The trend reflects the sensitivity of pension obligations to interest rate assumptions and shows EMR's pension liability management improved materially in 2023 before reversing slightly in 2024.",

      "answer": "Emerson's expected return on U.S. pension plan assets remained at 6.00% in 2022, stayed unchanged at 6.00% in 2023, and then increased to 6.50% in 2024. This trajectory shows a deliberate stabilization followed by a strategic upward adjustment in return expectations, suggesting the company regained confidence in its pension fund investment strategy after a period of economic uncertainty.",

      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx reported a $224 million impact from the termination of the TNT Express Netherlands pension plan. By 2023 and 2024, this line item had dropped to zero, indicating the termination's financial effects were fully recognized by the end of 2022. Over the same period, FedEx experienced a shift from a $1,578 million total MTM loss in 2022 to MTM losses of $650 million in 2023 and $561 million in 2024, showing a decreasing trend in overall pension-related volatility. This suggests that the completion of the TNT pension plan termination allowed FedEx to stabilize its pension obligations, contributing to a broader strategy of reducing long-term liabilities and improving financial predictability.",

      "answer": "FedEx's financial commitment to Aircraft and Related Equipment showed a decreasing trend in future lease obligations from 2022 to 2024, with the present value of lease liabilities dropping from $668 million in 2022 to $640 million in 2023, and a broader shift in asset ownership reflected in 2024's balance sheet showing $30.5 billion in owned Aircraft and Related Equipment, up from $29.1 billion in 2023. This indicates a strategic shift toward greater ownership of aircraft rather than leasing, reducing long-term lease liabilities while increasing capital investment in the fleet.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [FDX](2022) \u2192 [Aircraft and Related Equipment]: In 2022, the present value of lease liability for Aircraft and Related Equipment was $668 million, indicating significant future financial obligations tied to leased aircraft.",
        "Hop 2: [FDX](2023) \u2192 [Aircraft and Related Equipment]: By 2023, the present value of lease liability for Aircraft and Related Equipment had decreased to $640 million, showing a reduction in future leasing costs and a potential shift in fleet financing strategy.",

      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx experienced a $87 million cost related to pension plan amendments, indicating a financial burden from changes in pension obligations. By 2023 and 2024, the impact of pension plan amendments had shifted to a neutral level, with only a $1 million adjustment recorded in each year. This evolution suggests that FedEx either stabilized its pension obligations or completed necessary amendments, leading to reduced financial volatility associated with these pension changes over the three-year period.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: FDX(2022) \u2192 Pension Amendments: Pension plan amendments, including curtailment gains, resulted in a $87 million cost.",
        "Hop 2: FDX(2023) \u2192 Pension Amendments: Pension plan amendments had a $1 million adjustment, indicating a significant reduction in cost or stabilization.",
        "Hop 3: FDX(2024) \u2192 Pension Amendments: Pension plan amendments continued to show a $1 million adjustment, maintaining the stabilized trend observed in 2023."

      "answer": "FedEx's proceeds from stock issuances increased steadily from $184 million in fiscal 2022 to $231 million in fiscal 2023, and further to $491 million in fiscal 2024. This upward trend indicates a growing reliance on equity financing, suggesting a strategic shift toward strengthening liquidity and funding initiatives such as dividend payments and treasury stock repurchases.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [FDX](2022) \u2192 [Proceeds from Stock Issuances]: $184 million in fiscal 2022, indicating a relatively modest level of equity financing.",
        "Hop 2: [FDX](2023) \u2192 [Proceeds from Stock Issuances]: Increased to $231 million in fiscal 2023, showing a deliberate increase in equity capital utilization.",
        "Hop 3: [FDX](2024) \u2192 [Proceeds from Stock Issuances]: Surged to $491 million in fiscal 2024, more than doubling from the previous year, signaling a significant strategic emphasis on equity financing."

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, LMT's projected benefit payments for its Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans increased steadily, from $1,980 million in 2022 to $2,160 million in 2024, reflecting growing long-term liabilities. In 2023, LMT disclosed that the service cost component of pension expense was recorded in the cost of sales accounts, while non-service components were split between non-service FAS pension income (expense) and other non-operating income (expense), indicating a refined accounting treatment. By 2024, LMT reported the impact of actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs on accumulated other comprehensive loss, showing increased volatility in pension obligations due to changes in plan asset returns and benefit valuations. This 3-year progression reveals both a growing pension liability and a more dynamic accounting sensitivity to market and actuarial assumptions.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's strategic focus in the Space segment evolved significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the Space segment absorbed the financial impact of the renationalization of the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) program, which had previously contributed $885 million in sales and $18 million in operating profit in 2021. By 2023, Space experienced a significant increase in product costs\u2014up $815 million\u2014driven by the ramp-up of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) development program and higher volume in the Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) program, signaling increased investment in strategic missile systems. In 2024, Lockheed Martin made a transformative move by acquiring Terran Orbital Corporation for $314 million, expanding its satellite design and production capabilities within the Space segment. This acquisition marked a clear strategic pivot to enhance capabilities in space systems and align with evolving customer demands.",

We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international  customers  with  products  and  services  that  have  defense,  civil  and  commercial  applications,  with  our  principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. As described in 'Note 4 - Information on Business Segments', we operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space.\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract to operate the UK's nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE program)). Accordingly,  the AWE  program's  ongoing  operations,  including  the  entity  that  manages  the  program,  are  no longer included in our financial results as of that date, however, during 2021, AWE generated sales of $885 million and operating profit of $18 million, which are included in Space's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December  31,  2020, AWE  generated  sales  of  $1.4  billion  and  operating  profit  of  $35  million,  which  are  included  in  Space's financial results for 2020.\n\nBasis of presentation - These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest  entities  if  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  We  eliminate  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  in  consolidation.  We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is  generally  longer  than  one  year.  This  primarily  impacts  receivables,  contract  assets,  inventories,  and  contract  liabilities.  We classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year.\n\nUse of estimates - We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP).  In  doing  so,  we  are  required  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets for impairment; income taxes including deferred income taxes; fair value measurements; and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition -The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract  when  it  has  approval  and  commitment  from  both  parties,  the  rights  of  the  parties  are  identified,  payment  terms  are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing  requirements,  primarily  international  direct  commercial  sale  contracts,  we  are  required  to  obtain  certain  regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Portfolio Shaping Activities\n\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\n\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses, investments and ventures at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses, investments or ventures that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with a different owner. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.\n\nOn September 9, 2024, we completed the sale of our Commercial Engine Solutions (CES) business, which was part of our Aeronautics business segment. We received $170 million in cash from the sale. G ains recognized from the sale in 2024 were not significant. The final gain is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital, indemnification, and tax  adjustments, which we ex pect to complete in 2025. This sale did not represent a strategic shift and the impacts to our consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash were not significant. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows for the CES business up to the divestiture date have not been reclassified to discontinued operations.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $314 million, which will be included in our Space business segment. Terran Orbital's product and service offerings include satellite design, production, launch planning, mission operations, and on-orbit support for the aerospace and defense industries. We believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings, provide additional innovative solutions to meet our customers' emerging requirements, and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Terran Orbital.\n\n## U.S. Budget E nvironment\n\nWith approximately three quarters of our sales from the U.S. G overnment, U.S. G overnment spending levels, particularly defense spending, and timely funding thereof can affect our financial performance over the short and long term.\n\nOn March 22, 2024, the President signed into law the second Fiscal Y ear (FY ) 2024 Consolidated Appropriations package, which includes the DoD funding. This legislation reflects the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA) spending limit of $886 billion for National Defense, of which $842 billion was for the DoD base budget.\n\nThe  President's  FY   2025  budget  request  was  submitted  to  Congress  on  March  11,  2024,  initiating  the  FY   2025  defense  authorization  and  appropriations legislative process. The request included $895 billion for National Defense, of which $850 billion is for the DoD base budget, in keeping with the limit established by the FRA. While compression on overall requirements driven by the FRA limit is evident, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has stated the FY  2025 budget proposal meets their objectives of keeping National Defense Strategy priorities on track.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the President signed a bill providing a total of $95 billion in additional supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, including funding for the restock of U.S. munitions capacity. Supplemental funding legislation is not subject to the FRA limits.\n\nThe House and Senate continue the legislative process on the FY  2025 budget. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Y ear 2025, signed by the President on December 24, 2024, is consistent with the FY  2025 President's Budget Request (PBR) and Congressionally mandated budget caps established by the FRA with a topline of $849.8 billion. The House Appropriations Committee also marked its bill at this same level. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, did not adhere to the FRA spending caps and marked budgets above the PBR, providing between a $21 billion and $25 billion increase over the PBR level. Regardless of toplines, all four Committees support additional funding for several of our programs, spread across our four business areas.\n\nCongress still needs to approve or revise the President's FY 2025 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY  2025 budget process to conclude. A second Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY  2025 passed the House and Senate on December 20, 2024, and was signed by the President on December 21, 2024. The bill funds U.S. G overnment operations through March 14, 2025. In addition to the Continuing Resolution, the President also signed the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act on December 21, 2024, which includes more than $100 billion in supplemental funding. Of note, the final version of the bill did",

      "question": "How did Lockheed Martin's RMS segment evolve from 2022 to 2024 in terms of operational restructuring, cost impacts, and strategic alignment, and what does this multi-year trajectory suggest about the segment's long-term efficiency initiatives?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Lockheed Martin's RMS segment underwent a progressive operational restructuring aimed at improving efficiency and aligning with changing program lifecycles. In 2022, the company recorded $100 million in severance and asset impairment charges specifically tied to RMS, signaling the start of a strategic realignment. In 2023, RMS was explicitly called out as one of the four core business segments, indicating its continued strategic importance and operational integration within Lockheed Martin\u2019s broader structure. By 2024, the company expanded its restructuring efforts across the corporation, recording $92 million in severance and asset charges, though no longer limited to RMS alone. This 3-year trajectory reflects a deliberate, multi-phase efficiency initiative that began with targeted restructuring in RMS and evolved into a broader corporate cost-optimization strategy, suggesting long-term commitment to operational agility and lifecycle cost management.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe  have  a  number  of  programs  that  are  designated  as  classified  by  the  U.S.  Government  which  cannot  be  specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.\n\nOur net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well  as  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government.  We  recognize  revenue  as  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. Lower than expected supply chain activity negatively affected our net sales during 2021.\n\nChanges in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts.  V olume  changes  in  segment  operating  profit  are  typically  based  on  the  current  profit  booking  rate  for  a  particular contract.\n\nIn  addition,  comparability  of  our  segment  sales,  operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-ofcompletion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nOur  consolidated  net  adjustments  not  related  to  volume,  including  net  profit  booking  rate  adjustments  and  other  matters, increased  segment  operating  profit  by  approximately  $2.0  billion  in  2021  and  $1.8  billion  in  2020.  The  consolidated  net adjustments in 2021 compared to 2020 increased primarily due to increases in profit booking rate adjustments at Space, MFC and RMS offset by a decrease in Aeronautics. The consolidated net adjustments for 2021 are inclusive of approximately $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for a classified program at Aeronautics, various programs at RMS and a commercial ground  solutions  program  at  Space.  The  consolidated  net  adjustments  for  2020  are  inclusive  of  approximately  $745  million  in unfavorable items, which include reserves for various programs at RMS, government satellite programs at Space and performance matters on a sensors and global sustainment international military program at MFC.\n\nWe  periodically  experience  performance  issues  and  record  losses  for  certain  programs.  For  further  discussion  on  certain programs at Aeronautics  and  RMS,  see  'Note  1  -  Organization  and  Significant Accounting  Policies'  included  in  our  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

      "question": "How did the volume and revenue per piece for UPS's Deferred product evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the product's performance and pricing strategy over time?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS's Deferred volume declined significantly, falling from 1,553 thousand packages per day in 2022 to 1,224 thousand in 2023 (a 21.2% drop), and further to 1,058 thousand in 2024 (an additional 13.6% decline). Despite this volume contraction, revenue per piece for the Deferred product increased steadily: from $15.07 in 2022 to $16.38 in 2023 (an $1.31 or 8.7% increase), and then to $17.77 in 2024 (an additional $1.39 or 8.5% increase). This indicates that UPS successfully implemented a pricing strategy that offset volume losses, maintaining or improving per-unit revenue even as overall demand for the product waned.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nBusiness-to-consumer shipments represented approximately 60.7% of average daily volume compared to 63.6% in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\n\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\n\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\n\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's ('DOE') Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic Air and Ground products were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, UPS consistently disclosed that the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for all U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefit Plans exceeded plan assets each year. This persistent underfunding indicates that the company has not achieved funded status for these obligations during the three-year period, suggesting a sustained reliance on alternative funding strategies or future cash contributions to meet long-term liabilities.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, HON's gross decreases related to prior period tax positions showed a fluctuating pattern: $19 million in 2022, $0 in 2023, and $17 million in 2024. This suggests that while there were material reversals or adjustments to previously recognized tax benefits in 2022 and 2024, the company experienced a temporary stabilization in 2023 with no decreases recorded for that category. The recurring decreases in 2022 and 2024 indicate ongoing scrutiny or resolution of earlier tax positions, with a notable absence in 2023, pointing to potential volatility in tax benefit management over the 3-year period.",

      "answer": "Honeywell's 'Increase in Investments' cash outflows decreased from $2,373 million in 2022 to $560 million in 2023, before rising sharply to $1,077 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a significant reduction in investment activity in 2023, followed by a partial rebound in 2024, suggesting a strategic shift toward more selective capital deployment in 2023 and a renewed, though still cautious, investment approach in 2024.",

        "Hop 1: [HON](2022) \u2192 [Increase in Investments]: In 2022, Honeywell reported an increase in investments of $2,373 million, indicating a relatively high level of capital deployment into investment vehicles.",
        "Hop 2: [HON](2023) \u2192 [Increase in Investments]: In 2023, the company's increase in investments dropped significantly to $560 million, showing a sharp reduction in investment activity compared to the prior year.",
        "Hop 3: [HON](2024) \u2192 [Increase in Investments]: By 2024, Honeywell's increase in investments rose to $1,077 million, reflecting a partial rebound from the 2023 low, though still below the 2022 level."

      "question": "How did the financial impact of HON's audit resolutions with tax authorities evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this progression reveal about the company's tax position stability and audit outcomes over time?",
      "answer": "The financial impact of HON's audit resolutions with tax authorities increased significantly from $1 million in 2022 to $132 million in 2023, followed by a decrease to $31 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a sharp escalation in audit resolutions during 2023, which may reflect either a backlog of audits being cleared or increased scrutiny, followed by a return to relatively lower levels in 2024. The volatility across the three years suggests an evolving tax risk profile, with 2023 being a pivotal year for audit-related tax settlements.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HON(2022) \u2192 Decrease related to resolutions of audits with tax authorities: $1 million decrease in 2022 indicates minimal audit resolution impact that year.",

        "Hop 3: HON(2024) \u2192 Decrease related to resolutions of audits with tax authorities: $31 million decrease in 2024, a sharp drop from 2023, indicates a return to lower levels of audit resolution activity."

      "answer": "HON's gross increases related to prior period tax positions were $39M in 2022, surged to $181M in 2023, and then dropped sharply to $12M in 2024. This pattern indicates significant volatility in the company's historical tax positions, suggesting potential changes in tax strategy, audit resolutions, or regulatory scrutiny during this time. The large increase in 2023 followed by a steep decline in 2024 implies that the company either identified or resolved substantial prior period tax matters in 2023, which were subsequently adjusted or finalized in 2024.",

      "question": "How did the discount rate used to determine interest cost for U.S. pension plans at Emerson (EMR) evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's long-term pension liability assumptions in a rising interest rate environment?",
      "answer": "The discount rate used to determine interest cost for U.S. pension plans at Emerson increased from 2.31% in 2022 to 5.49% in 2023, and further to 5.94% in 2024. This steady increase reflects a strategic adjustment in pension liability assumptions consistent with broader market interest rate trends, particularly the Federal Reserve's tightening cycle during this period. The upward trajectory in the discount rate suggests that Emerson recalibrated its actuarial assumptions to align with higher yields on high-quality corporate bonds, which are typically used to measure discount rates for pension obligations. This shift would reduce the present value of pension liabilities over time, indicating a more favorable funding position in a rising interest rate environment.",

      "question": "How did Emerson's Total Accumulated Benefit Obligation (TABO) evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the 3-year trend reveal about the company's pension liability exposure and discount rate sensitivity?",
      "answer": "Emerson's Total Accumulated Benefit Obligation (TABO) was $3,910 million in 2022, decreased slightly to $3,719 million in 2023, and then increased to $3,942 million in 2024. This fluctuation reflects the sensitivity of pension liabilities to changes in discount rates, which dropped significantly in 2024 (from 6.03% to 4.97% for U.S. plans and from 5.2% to 4.7% for non-U.S. plans), reversing the upward trend seen in 2023 when discount rates had increased. The pattern reveals that Emerson's pension liability exposure is highly sensitive to interest rate movements, with lower rates increasing obligations and higher rates reducing them.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [EMR](2023) \u2192 [Total Accumulated Benefit Obligation]: TABO was $3,719 million in 2023, reflecting higher discount rates compared to 2022.",
        "Hop 2: [EMR](2024) \u2192 [Total Accumulated Benefit Obligation]: TABO rose to $3,942 million in 2024 due to a significant drop in discount rates, increasing pension liabilities.",
        "Hop 3: [EMR](2022) \u2192 [Total Accumulated Benefit Obligation]: TABO stood at $3,910 million in 2022, with a notable increase in discount rates from 2021 contributing to a lower liability compared to the prior year."

      "answer": "Emerson's expected return on plan assets for U.S. pension plans decreased from 6.75% in 2020 (used for 2022 reporting) to 6.00% in 2022, remained stable at 6.00% in 2023, and then increased to 6.50% in 2024.

      "answer": "The discount rate used to determine interest cost for U.S. pension plans at Emerson increased from 2.31% in 2022 to 5.49% in 2023, and further to 5.94% in 2024. This significant upward trend reflects the company's adjustment of pension assumptions in response to rising interest rates during this period, which likely reduced the present value of benefit obligations and affected net pension expense.",

        "Hop 1: [EMR](2022) \u2192 [Discount Rate Interest Cost U.S. Plans]: The discount rate used to determine interest cost was 2.31% in 2022, indicating a low-interest-rate environment assumption.",
        "Hop 2: [EMR](2023) \u2192 [Discount Rate Interest Cost U.S. Plans]: The rate increased to 5.49% in 2023, showing a significant adjustment upward as macroeconomic interest rates began to rise.",
        "Hop 3: [EMR](2024) \u2192 [Discount Rate Interest Cost U.S. Plans]: The rate further increased to 5.94% in 2024, demonstrating a continued recalibration of pension assumptions in line with higher market rates."

      "answer": "Emerson's Total Accumulated Benefit Obligation (TABO) decreased from $5,634 in fiscal year 2022 to $3,719 in 2023, then slightly increased to $3,942 in 2024. This pattern indicates a significant de-risking or liability reduction effort in 2023, likely driven by rising discount rates which lowered the present value of future obligations. However, the modest increase in 2024 followed a drop in discount rates, which increased the valuation of pension liabilities. The company's U.S. pension plans remained overfunded (from $513 in 2022 to $800 in 2024), while non-U.S. plans remained underfunded (from -$57 in 2022 to -$38 in 2024), suggesting ongoing global pension risk management.",

      "answer": "Emerson's expected return on U.S. pension plan assets decreased from 6.00% in 2022 to remain unchanged at 6.00% in 2023, before increasing to 6.50% in 2024. This pattern suggests a strategic recalibration in the company's pension fund management, shifting from a conservative outlook in 2022 to a more optimistic long-term investment approach by 2024, potentially reflecting improved market conditions or changes in asset allocation.",

          "chunk_text": "\n[a] 2019 has been recast to conform to the current year presentation which reflects minor refinements.\n\n[b] As reported to the STB.\n\nGross  and  Revenue  Ton-Miles -  Gross  ton-miles  are  calculated  by  multiplying  the  weight  of  loaded  and  empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the  number  of  tariff  miles.  In  2021,  gross  ton-miles  and  revenue  ton-miles  increased  6%  and  7%,  respectively, compared to 2020, driven by a 4% increase in carloadings. Changes in commodity mix drove the variance in yearover-year increases between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles, and carloads (smaller increases in our intermodal and  automotive  shipments,  which  are  generally  lighter,  coupled  with  higher  increases  in  grain  and  industrial shipments, which are generally heavier).\n\nFreight Car Velocity - Freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network. The two key drivers  of  this  metric  are  the  speed  of  the  train  between  terminals  (average  train  speed)  and  the  time  a  rail  car spends at the terminals (average terminal dwell time). Train speed slowed and terminal dwell increased in 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 as the network handled additional volume and was impacted by weather and wildfire-related challenges, bridge outages caused by the California wildfires, other incidents causing delays on the network, and global supply chain disruptions. Continued implementation of our operating plan helped to partially offset these impacts.\n\nLocomotive  Productivity -  Locomotive  productivity  is  gross  ton-miles  per  average  daily  locomotive  horsepower. Locomotive productivity decreased 3% in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by the increased active fleet needed to handle  the  4%  volume  increase  as  well  as  manage  network  disruptions,  partially  offset  by  transportation  plan changes.\n\nTrain  Length -  Train  length  is  the  average  maximum  train  length  on  a  route  measured  in  feet.  Our  train  length increased 6% compared to 2020 as a result of blending service products and transportation plan changes designed to improve overall operational efficiency. However, in the second half of the year, train length declined slightly from the first half of 2021 due to California wildfire bridge outage reroutes in the third quarter and operational challenges in the fourth quarter.\n\nCar Trip Plan Compliance - Car trip plan compliance is the percentage of cars delivered on time in accordance with our  original  trip  plan.  Our  network  trip  plan  compliance  is  broken  into  the  intermodal  and  manifest/automotive products.  Intermodal  trip  plan  compliance  deteriorated  in  2021  compared  to  2020  primarily  due  to  global  supply chain disruptions. Manifest/automotive trip plan compliance deteriorated in 2021 compared to 2020 as our network slowed  because  of  the  outages  and  incidents  described  above  that  required  increased  resource  allocation  and rebalancing.\n\nWorkforce  Productivity -  Workforce  productivity  is  average  daily  car  miles  per  employee.  Workforce  productivity improved 10%, reaching an all-time record as employee counts were down 3% compared to 2020, while average daily car miles increased 6%. Productivity initiatives and a smaller capital workforce offset higher train and engine employee  levels due to weather and wildfire-related challenges, network disruptions,  and  reduced  crew utilization keeping total employee levels lower than 2020.",

Measuring our performance relativ e to a historical benchmark demonstrates our focus on continuously improv ing serv ice for our customers, and  we  believ e  it  is  a  better  indicator  of  serv ice  performance  than  the  prev iously  disclosed  trip  plan  compliance.  SPI  does  not  replace  the  serv ice commitments we have contractually agreed to with a small number of customers. SPI is calculated for intermodal and manifest products. Intermodal SPI improved 2 points, at the same time international v olume surged. Manifest SPI improv ed 4 points in 2024 compared to 2023.\n\nWorkforce Productivity - Workforce productiv ity is av erage daily car miles per employee.

In addition, we are maintaining an adequate training pipeline to prov ide a capacity buffer to enable responsiv eness in an ev er-changing demand and operating env ironment.\n\nOperating Ratio - Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating rev enues.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, LMT's projected benefit payments for its Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans increased steadily, rising from $1,980 million in 2022 to $2,080 million in 2023 and $2,160 million in 2024, indicating a growing long-term liability. In 2023, LMT disclosed that the service cost component of pension expense was recorded in the cost of sales accounts, while non-service components were separated into a distinct pension income/expense account, reflecting a structured approach to pension cost attribution. By 2024, LMT reported changes in actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs as part of accumulated other comprehensive loss, showing the impact of asset return variances and benefit obligation remeasurements on equity. This evolution reveals a more nuanced and transparent treatment of pension-related financial impacts over time, with increasing emphasis on actuarial precision and alignment with market performance.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LMT's Space segment included legacy revenue from the UK's Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) program, which generated $885 million in sales and $18 million in operating profit before the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract on June 30, 2021. In 2023, the Space segment experienced a significant increase in product costs\u2014up $815 million\u2014driven by the ramp-up of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) development program and higher volume in the Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) program. In 2024, LMT strategically expanded its Space segment by acquiring Terran Orbital for $314 million, adding satellite design, production, and on-orbit support capabilities. This acquisition marked a clear pivot toward enhancing commercial and defense satellite offerings. The evolution from reliance on legacy programs in 2022, to internal growth through major defense programs in 2023, to external expansion via acquisition in 2024 shows a multi-year transformation of the Space segment's strategic positioning.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Portfolio Shaping Activities\n\nWe continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\n\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses, investments and ventures at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses, investments or ventures that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with a different owner. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.\n\nOn September 9, 2024, we completed the sale of our Commercial Engine Solutions (CES) business, which was part of our Aeronautics business segment. We received $170 million in cash from the sale. G ains recognized from the sale in 2024 were not significant. The final gain is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital, indemnification, and tax  adjustments, which we ex pect to complete in 2025. This sale did not represent a strategic shift and the impacts to our consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash were not significant. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows for the CES business up to the divestiture date have not been reclassified to discontinued operations.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $314 million, which will be included in our Space business segment. Terran Orbital's product and service offerings include satellite design, production, launch planning, mission operations, and on-orbit support for the aerospace and defense industries. We believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings, provide additional innovative solutions to meet our customers' emerging requirements, and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Terran Orbital.\n\n## U.S. Budget E nvironment\n\nWith approximately three quarters of our sales from the U.S. G overnment, U.S. G overnment spending levels, particularly defense spending, and timely funding thereof can affect our financial performance over the short and long term.\n\nOn March 22, 2024, the President signed into law the second Fiscal Y ear (FY ) 2024 Consolidated Appropriations package, which includes the DoD funding. This legislation reflects the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA) spending limit of $886 billion for National Defense, of which $842 billion was for the DoD base budget.\n\nThe  President's  FY   2025  budget  request  was  submitted  to  Congress  on  March  11,  2024,  initiating  the  FY   2025  defense  authorization  and  appropriations legislative process. The request included $895 billion for National Defense, of which $850 billion is for the DoD base budget, in keeping with the limit established by the FRA. While compression on overall requirements driven by the FRA limit is evident, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has stated the FY  2025 budget proposal meets their objectives of keeping National Defense Strategy priorities on track.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the President signed a bill providing a total of $95 billion in additional supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, including funding for the restock of U.S. munitions capacity. Supplemental funding legislation is not subject to the FRA limits.\n\nThe House and Senate continue the legislative process on the FY  2025 budget. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Y ear 2025, signed by the President on December 24, 2024, is consistent with the FY  2025 President's Budget Request (PBR) and Congressionally mandated budget caps established by the FRA with a topline of $849.8 billion. The House Appropriations Committee also marked its bill at this same level. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, did not adhere to the FRA spending caps and marked budgets above the PBR, providing between a $21 billion and $25 billion increase over the PBR level. Regardless of toplines, all four Committees support additional funding for several of our programs, spread across our four business areas.\n\nCongress still needs to approve or revise the President's FY 2025 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY  2025 budget process to conclude. A second Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY  2025 passed the House and Senate on December 20, 2024, and was signed by the President on December 21, 2024. The bill funds U.S. G overnment operations through March 14, 2025. In addition to the Continuing Resolution, the President also signed the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act on December 21, 2024, which includes more than $100 billion in supplemental funding. Of note, the final version of the bill did",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Lockheed Martin Corporation\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies\n\nOrganization - We are a global security and aerospace company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international  customers  with  products  and  services  that  have  defense,  civil  and  commercial  applications,  with  our  principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. As described in 'Note 4 - Information on Business Segments', we operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space.\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract to operate the UK's nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE program)). Accordingly,  the AWE  program's  ongoing  operations,  including  the  entity  that  manages  the  program,  are  no longer included in our financial results as of that date, however, during 2021, AWE generated sales of $885 million and operating profit of $18 million, which are included in Space's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December  31,  2020, AWE  generated  sales  of  $1.4  billion  and  operating  profit  of  $35  million,  which  are  included  in  Space's financial results for 2020.\n\nBasis of presentation - These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest  entities  if  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  We  eliminate  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  in  consolidation.  We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is  generally  longer  than  one  year.  This  primarily  impacts  receivables,  contract  assets,  inventories,  and  contract  liabilities.  We classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year.\n\nUse of estimates - We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP).  In  doing  so,  we  are  required  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets for impairment; income taxes including deferred income taxes; fair value measurements; and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition -The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract  when  it  has  approval  and  commitment  from  both  parties,  the  rights  of  the  parties  are  identified,  payment  terms  are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing  requirements,  primarily  international  direct  commercial  sale  contracts,  we  are  required  to  obtain  certain  regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

      "answer": "The weighted average dilutive effect of equity awards decreased from 1.0 million shares in 2022 to 0.9 million in 2023, and remained stable at 0.9 million in 2024.

Correspondingly, the total weighted average common shares outstanding for diluted computations declined from 277.4 million in 2022 to 251.2 million in 2023 and further to 239.2 million in 2024, suggesting that Lockheed Martin may have implemented share repurchase programs or revised equity incentive structures to mitigate dilution despite ongoing equity-based compensation.",

The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.\n\nOur net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well  as  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government.  We  recognize  revenue  as  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. Lower than expected supply chain activity negatively affected our net sales during 2021.\n\nChanges in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts.  V olume  changes  in  segment  operating  profit  are  typically  based  on  the  current  profit  booking  rate  for  a  particular contract.\n\nIn  addition,  comparability  of  our  segment  sales,  operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-ofcompletion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nOur  consolidated  net  adjustments  not  related  to  volume,  including  net  profit  booking  rate  adjustments  and  other  matters, increased  segment  operating  profit  by  approximately  $2.0  billion  in  2021  and  $1.8  billion  in  2020.  The  consolidated  net adjustments in 2021 compared to 2020 increased primarily due to increases in profit booking rate adjustments at Space, MFC and RMS offset by a decrease in Aeronautics. The consolidated net adjustments for 2021 are inclusive of approximately $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for a classified program at Aeronautics, various programs at RMS and a commercial ground  solutions  program  at  Space.  The  consolidated  net  adjustments  for  2020  are  inclusive  of  approximately  $745  million  in unfavorable items, which include reserves for various programs at RMS, government satellite programs at Space and performance matters on a sensors and global sustainment international military program at MFC.\n\nWe  periodically  experience  performance  issues  and  record  losses  for  certain  programs.  For  further  discussion  on  certain programs at Aeronautics  and  RMS,  see  'Note  1  -  Organization  and  Significant Accounting  Policies'  included  in  our  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Combat Systems segment reported several major contract awards, including a $845M U.S. Army Stryker vehicle upgrade contract and a $555M contract for Piranha 5 armored vehicles for Romania, indicating strong international and domestic program momentum. However, by 2023, the segment experienced margin pressure due to 'lower-margin artillery facilities expansion work,' signaling a shift in the nature of contracts being executed. In 2024, the segment's physical footprint grew significantly, with a total of 18.2 million square feet of facilities, including 4.9 million square feet of government-owned facilities, suggesting increased infrastructure investment and long-term commitment to the segment. The combination of high-value contract wins in 2022, margin challenges in 2023, and facility expansion in 2024 indicates a strategic shift toward scaling operations despite short-term margin pressures, likely to secure long-term franchise positions in combat systems.",

The decrease in C5ISR solutions revenue was also due to approximately $115 of revenue in 2020 from a satellite communications business that was sold in the second quarter of that year. These decreases were offset partially by increased IT services revenue due to the ramp up of several new programs and higher volume on existing programs due to the reopening of, and increased access to, customer sites following limitations imposed in 2020 due to the pandemic.\n\nThe  Technologies  segment's  operating  margin  increased  60  basis  points  compared  with  2020  due  to favorable contract mix and reduced COVID-related impacts in our IT services business, particularly customer reimbursement of idle workforce cost at zero fee in 2020 and early 2021. Additionally, operating results in 2020 included  an  approximate  $40  loss  on  a  contract  with  a  non-U.S.  customer  from  schedule  delays  caused  by COVID-related travel restrictions, offset partially by a gain on the sale of the satellite communications business.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nWe expect the Technologies segment's 2022 revenue to be between $12.8 and $13 billion with operating margin of around 10%.\n\n## CORPORATE\n\nCorporate  operating  results  totaled  $84  in  2021  and  $56  in  2020  and  consisted  primarily  of  equity-based compensation expense.

These include advanced fire-control and weapon launch system s, tactical control system s, specialized hardware and software solutions for acoustics, cybersecurity , and torpedo guidance, and other core capabilities that are essential for subm arine m odernization with U.S. and allied forces.\n\nMission Systems also continues to invest in autonom ous capabilities both undersea and in the air.  Our  Unm anned  Undersea  V ehicle (UUV) Manufacturing and Assembly Center of Excellence provides m anufacturing, assem bly , integration and testing capabilities for Mission System s' Bluefin Robotics  UUVs, as well as the  Hammerhead and MEDUSA programs for the Navy . In addition, we support a variety of manned aircraft and unmanned aerial vehicle (UA V) platform s with m ission-critical processing and security subsystem s on both m odern com bat and ISR aircraft as well as emerging capabilities like the Collaborative Com bat Aircraft.\n\nRevenue for the T echnologies segm ent was 27% of our consolidated revenue in 2024, 31% in 2023 and 32% in 2022. Revenue by major products and services was as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics' Aerospace segment reported an operating margin of 12.7%, with expectations of margin expansion in the following years due to increased aircraft deliveries. In 2023, the margin improved by 50 basis points to 13.7%, driven by higher aircraft services volume, despite supply chain challenges affecting manufacturing. However, in 2024, the margin declined by 70 basis points from the previous year, despite revenue growth and the entry into service of the G700 aircraft, due to additional costs from supplier quality issues and late component deliveries. This trajectory reveals a volatile profitability trend, where initial gains were reversed in 2024, suggesting that execution challenges and production ramp-up costs can offset the benefits of increased deliveries and service revenue.",

      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics described that in its defense segments, billing typically occurs after revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets, while advances or deposits, especially on international contracts, lead to contract liabilities. In 2023, the company emphasized that the timing mismatch between revenue recognition, billings, and cash collections continues to result in billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and customer advances, and clarified that these are reported contract-by-contract on the balance sheet. By 2024, the disclosure remained largely consistent with 2022, reiterating that billing follows revenue recognition in defense contracts and that deposits in aerospace are liquidated as revenue is recognized.

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, RTX consistently excluded the effects of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations when calculating the organic change in Net Sales. In 2022, the company explicitly stated that these fluctuations were excluded alongside acquisitions, divestitures, and other non-recurring items to improve year-over-year comparability. In 2023, RTX reinforced this methodology, noting that foreign exchange effects were part of the exclusions to better reflect the underlying business performance. By 2024, the company maintained the same exclusionary framework, emphasizing transparency and comparability for investors despite ongoing currency volatility. This consistent treatment indicates that RTX views foreign exchange impacts as non-operational and prioritizes organic performance clarity for stakeholders.",

We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability.

Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating  adjustment,  and  costs  related  to  certain  acquisition  accounting  adjustments.  Restructuring  costs  generally  arise  from  severance  related  to  workforce reductions and facility exit costs.  We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB)  expense  under  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  (FAS)  requirements  of  U.S.  GAAP  and  our  pension  and  PRB  expense  under  U.S.  government  Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), primarily related to our Raytheon segment.

      "question": "How did RTX's CAS expense evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the 3-year trend reveal about the company's pension cost recognition patterns under U.S. government CAS requirements?",
      "answer": "RTX's CAS expense decreased from $2,201 million in 2021 (reported in the 2022 10-K) to $1,735 million in 2022, then further declined to $1,272 million in 2023, and continued to decrease to $971 million in 2024. This consistent downward trend over the three-year period indicates a reduction in pension costs recognized under U.S. government CAS requirements, primarily driven by changes in funding status, demographic or economic experience, and plan assumptions. The decline in CAS expense contrasts with the fluctuating FAS service cost, highlighting differences in cost recognition patterns between CAS and FAS methodologies.",

If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity in future reporting periods.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. G oodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets.  The  fair  value  for  acquired  customer  relationship  intangibles  is  determined  as  of  the  acquisition  date  based  on  estimates  and  judgments  regarding expectations for the future after-tax  cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that ex isted on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of ex pected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.\n\nAlso included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. At December 31, 2024, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $3.3 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $5.5 billion. We assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms, including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value ex ceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill, we primarily utilize a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies. For the quantitative assessments of indefinitelived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method.  These quantitative assessments incorporate significant assumptions that include sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions.\n\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. We assessed all of our reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required.\n\nThe Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact our significant assumptions used in testing goodwill, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company's market capitalization, and general industry, market, and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge.\n\nWe also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing using a qualitative approach as of  October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. As noted above, our indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis involves significant assumptions that are subject to variability. Material changes in these assumptions could occur and result in impairments in future periods.\n\nContingent Liabilities. As described in 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory, and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts,  performance  and  operating  cost  guarantees,  employee  benefit  plans,  legal,  and  environmental,  health,  and  safety  matters.  In  particular,  the  design, development, production, and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these technologies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates.

      "answer": "RTX consistently disclosed the organic change in Net Sales as a non-GAAP metric across all three years\u20142022, 2023, and 2024\u2014to provide transparency into the underlying performance of its business, excluding the effects of acquisitions, divestitures, and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. In 2022, RTX emphasized that this metric allows for better year-over-year comparability and is particularly relevant for understanding the performance of its RIS and RMD segments. In 2023, the company expanded on this by detailing that the metric also excludes restructuring costs, FAS/CAS operating adjustments, and acquisition accounting adjustments, reinforcing its commitment to revealing core operational performance. By 2024, RTX maintained the same methodology but placed greater emphasis on the metric's role in segment-level performance evaluation, especially for Pratt & Whitney, where foreign exchange hedging impacts were also factored into the analysis. The consistent use and refinement of the organic change in Net Sales metric across all three years indicate a strategic focus on isolating sustainable revenue growth and managing cost structure amid external volatility.",

'Business' of this Form 10-K.\n\nSegments are generally based on the management structure of the businesses and the grouping of similar operations, based on capabilities and technologies, where each management organization has general operating autonomy over diversified products and services. Segment Total net sales and Operating profit (loss) include intercompany sales and profit, which are ultimately eliminated within Eliminations and other, which also includes certain smaller non-reportable segments. Segment results ex clude certain acquisition accounting adjustments, the FAS/CAS operating adjustment, and certain corporate expenses, as further discussed below.\n\nWe present a FAS/CAS operating adjustment outside of segment results, which represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense under the Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements of U.S. GAAP and our pension and PRB expense under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) primarily related to our Raytheon segment. While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally ex pect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis.\n\nGiven the nature of our business, we believe that Total net sales and Operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management's view of our segment performance, as described below.\n\nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in 'Results of Operations.' We believe that these nonGAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability.

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does the progression reveal about the company's pension obligations and market adjustments over this period?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) underwent a significant transformation from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the company reported a total cost of $ (121) million, a notable improvement from the $ (723) million loss in 2023. By 2024, the company shifted to a net benefit of $ 63 million, indicating a reversal from a pension liability to a credit. This evolution reflects Caterpillar's improved pension fund performance, particularly in U.S. Pension Benefits, which improved from $ (269) million in 2022 to $ (74) million in 2024, and a reduction in Mark-to-Market losses from $ (606) million in 2022 to $ (154) million in 2024. The trend reveals a multi-year stabilization of pension obligations and improved market valuation assumptions.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's pre-tax profit increased from $8.2 billion in 2022 to $13.05 billion in 2023, and further to $13.37 billion in 2024. This represents a compound growth of approximately 62% over the three-year period. Over the same time, the company's effective tax rate also increased, from 21.2% in 2022 (calculated from $8.2 billion pre-tax and $1.742 billion tax provision) to 21.6% in 2023 (based on $8.752 billion pre-tax and $2.067 billion tax provision), and then to 19.6% in 2024 (from $13.373 billion pre-tax and $2.629 billion tax provision). The consistent growth in pre-tax profit indicates strong operational performance driven by increased sales in Machinery, Energy & Transportation, despite rising operating costs. The fluctuation in effective tax rate suggests shifting tax jurisdictions or changes in tax incentives, which could have impacted net profit growth.",

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's total customer receivables evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does the 3-year trend indicate about the company's credit exposure and financing activities?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's total customer receivables increased from $8,650 million in current status as of December 31, 2022, to $8,742 million as of December 31, 2023, and then slightly declined to $8,650 million as of December 31, 2024. However, the composition of these receivables shifted over time, with the 91+ days past due category rising from $45 million in 2022 to $55 million in 2023, before decreasing to $22 million in 2024. This indicates a temporary increase in credit risk in 2023, followed by some improvement in 2024. Meanwhile, revolving finance receivables increased from $334 million in 2022 to $548 million in 2024, showing a growing reliance on or expansion of revolving credit facilities tied to customer financing.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's mark-to-market loss (gain) shifted from a $606 million loss in 2022 to a $97 million loss in 2023, and then increased to a $154 million loss in 2024. This trajectory indicates a significant improvement in the company's pension fund performance in 2023, followed by a reversal in 2024 with a larger loss than the prior year. The fluctuation suggests volatility in the underlying pension assets or changes in discount rates, impacting Caterpillar's financial risk exposure and requiring closer management oversight.",

      "question": "How did Union Pacific's ownership and reliance on boxcars evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's asset strategy in its freight operations?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Union Pacific's ownership of boxcars increased from 2,210 in 2022 to 3,389 in 2023 and further to 3,741 in 2024, indicating a consistent strategic shift toward greater ownership of this segment of freight cars. Meanwhile, leased boxcars declined from 6,604 in 2022 to 7,572 in 2023, and then dropped significantly to 5,526 in 2024. This shows a deliberate effort to reduce dependency on leased boxcars and build a larger owned fleet, suggesting a long-term asset investment strategy focused on cost control and operational flexibility.",

        "Hop 3: [UNP](2022) \u2192 [Boxcars]: Owned 2,210 boxcars and leased 6,604, with an average age of 40.6 years, indicating older, more leased assets."

Measuring our performance relativ e to a historical benchmark demonstrates our focus on continuously improv ing serv ice for our customers, and  we  believ e  it  is  a  better  indicator  of  serv ice  performance  than  the  prev iously  disclosed  trip  plan  compliance.  SPI  does  not  replace  the  serv ice commitments we have contractually agreed to with a small number of customers. SPI is calculated for intermodal and manifest products. Intermodal SPI improved 2 points, at the same time international v olume surged.

Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the  number  of  tariff  miles.  In  2021,  gross  ton-miles  and  revenue  ton-miles  increased  6%  and  7%,  respectively, compared to 2020, driven by a 4% increase in carloadings. Changes in commodity mix drove the variance in yearover-year increases between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles, and carloads (smaller increases in our intermodal and  automotive  shipments,  which  are  generally  lighter,  coupled  with  higher  increases  in  grain  and  industrial shipments, which are generally heavier).\n\nFreight Car Velocity - Freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network. The two key drivers  of  this  metric  are  the  speed  of  the  train  between  terminals  (average  train  speed)  and  the  time  a  rail  car spends at the terminals (average terminal dwell time). Train speed slowed and terminal dwell increased in 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 as the network handled additional volume and was impacted by weather and wildfire-related challenges, bridge outages caused by the California wildfires, other incidents causing delays on the network, and global supply chain disruptions. Continued implementation of our operating plan helped to partially offset these impacts.\n\nLocomotive  Productivity -  Locomotive  productivity  is  gross  ton-miles  per  average  daily  locomotive  horsepower. Locomotive productivity decreased 3% in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by the increased active fleet needed to handle  the  4%  volume  increase  as  well  as  manage  network  disruptions,  partially  offset  by  transportation  plan changes.\n\nTrain  Length -  Train  length  is  the  average  maximum  train  length  on  a  route  measured  in  feet.  Our  train  length increased 6% compared to 2020 as a result of blending service products and transportation plan changes designed to improve overall operational efficiency. However, in the second half of the year, train length declined slightly from the first half of 2021 due to California wildfire bridge outage reroutes in the third quarter and operational challenges in the fourth quarter.\n\nCar Trip Plan Compliance - Car trip plan compliance is the percentage of cars delivered on time in accordance with our  original  trip  plan.  Our  network  trip  plan  compliance  is  broken  into  the  intermodal  and  manifest/automotive products.  Intermodal  trip  plan  compliance  deteriorated  in  2021  compared  to  2020  primarily  due  to  global  supply chain disruptions. Manifest/automotive trip plan compliance deteriorated in 2021 compared to 2020 as our network slowed  because  of  the  outages  and  incidents  described  above  that  required  increased  resource  allocation  and rebalancing.\n\nWorkforce  Productivity -  Workforce  productivity  is  average  daily  car  miles  per  employee.  Workforce  productivity improved 10%, reaching an all-time record as employee counts were down 3% compared to 2020, while average daily car miles increased 6%. Productivity initiatives and a smaller capital workforce offset higher train and engine employee  levels due to weather and wildfire-related challenges, network disruptions,  and  reduced  crew utilization keeping total employee levels lower than 2020.",

Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the  number  of  tariff  miles.  In  2021,  gross  ton-miles  and  revenue  ton-miles  increased  6%  and  7%,  respectively, compared to 2020, driven by a 4% increase in carloadings. Changes in commodity mix drove the variance in yearover-year increases between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles, and carloads (smaller increases in our intermodal and  automotive  shipments,  which  are  generally  lighter,  coupled  with  higher  increases  in  grain  and  industrial shipments, which are generally heavier).\n\nFreight Car Velocity - Freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network. The two key drivers  of  this  metric  are  the  speed  of  the  train  between  terminals  (average  train  speed)  and  the  time  a  rail  car spends at the terminals (average terminal dwell time). Train speed slowed and terminal dwell increased in 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 as the network handled additional volume and was impacted by weather and wildfire-related challenges, bridge outages caused by the California wildfires, other incidents causing delays on the network, and global supply chain disruptions. Continued implementation of our operating plan helped to partially offset these impacts.\n\nLocomotive  Productivity -  Locomotive  productivity  is  gross  ton-miles  per  average  daily  locomotive  horsepower. Locomotive productivity decreased 3% in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by the increased active fleet needed to handle  the  4%  volume  increase  as  well  as  manage  network  disruptions,  partially  offset  by  transportation  plan changes.\n\nTrain  Length -  Train  length  is  the  average  maximum  train  length  on  a  route  measured  in  feet.  Our  train  length increased 6% compared to 2020 as a result of blending service products and transportation plan changes designed to improve overall operational efficiency. However, in the second half of the year, train length declined slightly from the first half of 2021 due to California wildfire bridge outage reroutes in the third quarter and operational challenges in the fourth quarter.\n\nCar Trip Plan Compliance - Car trip plan compliance is the percentage of cars delivered on time in accordance with our  original  trip  plan.  Our  network  trip  plan  compliance  is  broken  into  the  intermodal  and  manifest/automotive products.  Intermodal  trip  plan  compliance  deteriorated  in  2021  compared  to  2020  primarily  due  to  global  supply chain disruptions. Manifest/automotive trip plan compliance deteriorated in 2021 compared to 2020 as our network slowed  because  of  the  outages  and  incidents  described  above  that  required  increased  resource  allocation  and rebalancing.\n\nWorkforce  Productivity -  Workforce  productivity  is  average  daily  car  miles  per  employee.  Workforce  productivity improved 10%, reaching an all-time record as employee counts were down 3% compared to 2020, while average daily car miles increased 6%. Productivity initiatives and a smaller capital workforce offset higher train and engine employee  levels due to weather and wildfire-related challenges, network disruptions,  and  reduced  crew utilization keeping total employee levels lower than 2020.",

      "answer": "GE's non-current compensation and benefits liabilities decreased significantly from $21,202 million in 2022 to $11,214 million in 2023, and further declined to $7,035 million in 2024. This consistent downward trend indicates a strategic reduction in long-term employee benefit obligations over the three-year period, likely reflecting restructuring efforts or pension liability management.",

      "question": "How did GE's 'All other assets' balance evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's treatment of these assets in relation to its discontinued operations?",
      "answer": "GE's 'All other assets' balance declined significantly from $554 million in 2022 to $200 million in 2023, and then increased sharply to $11,695 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a deliberate restructuring of asset composition, with a significant reduction in assets related to discontinued operations between 2022 and 2023, followed by a reclassification or reallocation of assets in 2024. The 2023 disclosure specifically notes 'Assets of discontinued operations' at $1,695 million, down from $31,890 million in 2022, while the 2024 filing shows 'Assets of discontinued operations' at $1,841 million, suggesting that the increase in 'All other assets' in 2024 likely reflects assets no longer categorized under discontinued operations or a strategic shift in asset classification.",

      "question": "How did GE's use of financing discounts for equipment purchases linked to long-term service agreements evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about the company's strategy in securing long-term service revenue commitments?",
      "answer": "GE consistently used financing discounts in 2022, 2023, and 2024 to incentivize customers to enter long-term service agreements alongside equipment purchases. In 2022, GE disclosed offering financing discounts for equipment sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements, with these arrangements accounted for as financing arrangements when payments were collected via higher usage-based fees. In 2023, GE reiterated this practice and emphasized that these financing discounts were tied to long-term service agreements within Aerospace and Power segments, indicating a strategic alignment of equipment sales with service revenue. In 2024, GE continued this disclosure, maintaining the same accounting treatment and noting that these discounts were still offered under similar conditions. The consistent use of financing discounts across all three years suggests that GE maintained a stable strategy to bundle equipment and services, aiming to secure recurring service revenue streams and deepen customer relationships over the lifecycle of the equipment.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1. BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\nFINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. Our financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GA A P), which requires us to make estimates based on assumptions about current, and for some estimates, future, economic and market conditions which affect reported amounts and related disclosures in our financial statements. A lthough our current estimates contemplate current and expected future conditions, as applicable, it is reasonably possible that actual conditions could differ from our expectations, which could materially affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Such changes could result in future impairments of goodwill, intangibles, long-lived assets, contract assets and investment securities, revisions to estimated profitability on long-term product service agreements, incremental credit losses on receivables and debt securities, incremental losses related to our contingencies, a change in the carrying amount of our tax assets and liabilities, or a change in our insurance liabilities and pension obligations as of the time of a relevant measurement event.\n\nIn preparing our Statement of Cash Flows, we make certain adjustments to reflect cash flows that cannot otherwise be calculated by changes in our Statement of Financial Position. These adjustments may include, but are not limited to, the effects of currency exchange, acquisitions and dispositions of businesses, businesses classified as held for sale, the timing of settlements to suppliers for property, plant and equipment, non-cash gains/losses and other balance sheet reclassifications.\n\nWe have reclassified certain prior-year amounts to conform to the current-year's presentation. Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Earnings per share amounts are computed independently for earnings from continuing operations, earnings from discontinued operations and net earnings. As a result, the sum of per-share amounts may not equal the total. Unless otherwise indicated, information in these notes to consolidated financial statements relates to continuing operations. Certain of our operations have been presented as discontinued. We present businesses whose disposal represents a strategic shift that has, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results as discontinued operations when the components meet the criteria for held for sale, are sold, or spun-off.\n\nOn April 2, 2024 and January 3, 2023, General Electric Company, now operating as GE A erospace, completed the previously announced separation of GE Vernova and its separation of GE HealthCare, respectively, which resulted in three independent, publicly traded companies - GE A erospace, GE V ernova and GE HealthCare. We are organized into two business segments that are aligned with the industries we serve: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies. The historical results of GE V ernova and GE HealthCare are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented. See Notes 2 and 25 for further information.\n\nCONSOLIDATION. Our financial statements consolidate all of our affiliates, entities where we have a controlling financial interest, most often because we hold a majority voting interest, or where we are required to apply the variable interest entity (V IE) model and we have the power to direct the most economically significant activities of entities. We reev aluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in all entities when our rights and interests change. A ll intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. We recognize revenue for equipment including commercial install and spare aircraft engines, defense aircraft engines, and other products we manufacture at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).\n\nWhere arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment, and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not provide for anticipated losses on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.\n\nOur billing terms for these contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer. We sometimes offer our customers financing discounts for the purchase of certain equipment when sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements. These sales are accounted for as financing arrangements when payments for the equipment are collected through higher usage-based fees from servicing the equipment. In some contracts, we receive progress collections from customers for large equipment purchases. Progress collections are not considered a significant financing component as they are used to meet working capital demands and protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. For certain commercial engine programs, we make payments to airlines when the aircraft with our engines are delivered by the airframers (aircraft allowances). We record aircraft allowances as a reduction in revenue when control of the engine is transferred to our airframer customer.\n\nSome of our contracts require us to make payments to customers related to failure to deliver our equipment on-time or meeting certain performance specifications, which is factored into our estimate of variable consideration using the expected value method taking into consideration performance relative to our contractual obligations, specified liquidated damages rates, if applicable, and history of paying damages to the customer or similar customers.\n\nREVENUE FROM THE SALE OF SERVICES. Spare Parts. We sell certain tangible products, largely spare parts, through our services businesses. We recognize revenue and bill our customers at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the good, which is when we deliver the spare part to the customer. In some cases, our contracts give rise to variable consideration in the form of volume or product durability discounts, which we incorporate into our estimate of transaction price using the expected value method. Delivery is measured using either proof of delivery or estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (time between shipment and delivery).",

We reevaluate whether we have a controlling financial interest in all entities when our rights and interests change.\n\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF EQUIPMENT. Performance Obligations Satisfied Over Time. We recognize revenue on agreements for the sale of customized goods including power generation equipment, long-term construction projects and military development contracts on an over-time basis as we customize the customer's equipment during the manufacturing or integration process and obtain right to payment for work performed.\n\nWe recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method, which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Our estimate of costs to be incurred to fulfill our promise to a customer is based on our history of manufacturing or constructing similar assets for customers and is updated routinely to reflect changes in quantity or pricing of the inputs. We provide for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.\n\nOur billing terms for these over-time contracts are generally based on achieving specified milestones. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied at a Point in Time. We recognize revenue on agreements for non-customized equipment including commercial aircraft engines, healthcare equipment and other goods we manufacture on a standardized basis for sale to the market at the point in time that the customer obtains control of the product, which is generally no earlier than when the customer has physical possession. We use proof of delivery for certain large equipment with more complex logistics, whereas the delivery of other equipment is estimated based on historical averages of in-transit periods (i.e., time between shipment and delivery).\n\nWhere arrangements include customer acceptance provisions based on seller or customer-specified objective criteria, we recognize revenue when we have concluded that the customer has control of the equipment and that acceptance is likely to occur. We do not provide for anticipated losses on point-in-time transactions prior to transferring control of the equipment to the customer.\n\nOur billing terms for these point-in-time equipment contracts generally coincide with delivery to the customer; however, within certain businesses, we receive progress collections from customers for large equipment purchases, to generally reserve production slots.\n\nREVENUES FROM THE SALE OF SERVICES. Consistent with our Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) discussion and the way we manage our businesses, we refer to sales under service agreements, which includes both goods (such as spare parts and equipment upgrades) and related services (such as monitoring, maintenance and repairs) as sales of 'services,' which is an important part of our operations. We sometimes offer our customers financing discounts for the purchase of certain equipment when sold in contemplation of long-term service agreements. These sales are accounted for as financing arrangements when payments for the equipment are collected through higher usage-based fees from servicing the equipment. See Note 8 for further information.\n\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied Over Time. We enter into long-term service agreements with our customers primarily within our Aviation and Power segments. These agreements require us to provide preventative maintenance, overhauls, and standby \"warrantytype\" services that include certain levels of assurance regarding asset performance and uptime throughout the contract periods, which generally range from 5 to 25 years. We account for items that are integral to the maintenance of the equipment as part of our performance obligation, unless the customer has a substantive right to make a separate purchasing decision (e.g., equipment upgrade).\n\nWe recognize revenue as we perform under the arrangements using the percentage of completion method which is based on our costs incurred to date relative to our estimate of total expected costs. Throughout the life of a contract, this measure of progress captures the nature, timing and extent of our underlying performance activities as our stand-ready services often fluctuate between routine inspections and maintenance, unscheduled service events and major overhauls at pre-determined usage intervals. We provide for potential losses on these agreements when it is probable that we will incur the loss.\n\nOur billing terms for these arrangements are generally based on the utilization of the asset (e.g., per hour of usage) or upon the occurrence of a major maintenance event within the contract, such as an overhaul. The differences between the timing of our revenue recognized (based on costs incurred) and customer billings (based on contractual terms) results in changes to our contract asset or contract liability positions.

In 2024, the company maintained the same methodology, reiterating that foreign exchange effects were excluded to enhance year-over-year analysis.

As  discussed  further  above  in  'Business  Overview,'  the  results  of  RIS  and  RMD  reflect  the  period  subsequent  to  the completion of the Raytheon Merger on April 3, 2020. As such, the results of RIS and RMD for the second quarter of 2020 exclude results prior to the date of completion of the Raytheon Merger, the estimated impact of which is approximately $400 million of sales and approximately $45 million of operating profit. These amounts, in addition to the first quarter of 2021 results, have been excluded  from  the  organic  changes  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  disclosed  throughout  our  Results  of  Operations discussion. In addition, as a result of the Separation Transactions and the Distributions, the historical results of Carrier and Otis are presented as discontinued operations and, as such, have been excluded from both continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented.\n\nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because  they  provide  transparency  to  the  underlying  performance  of  our  business,  which  allows  for  better  year-over-year comparability.

The following discussions of comparative results among periods, including the discussion of segment results, should be viewed in this context.\n\nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Cost of sales for our consolidated results of operations as well as the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit for our segments. We believe that these non-GAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability.  The organic change in  Net sales,  Cost of sales, and  Operating profit excludes acquisitions and divestitures, net, and the effect of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations and other significant non-operational items and/or significant operational items that may occur at irregular intervals (Other). Additionally, the organic change in Cost of sales and Operating profit excludes restructuring costs, the FAS/CAS operating  adjustment,  and  costs  related  to  certain  acquisition  accounting  adjustments.  Restructuring  costs  generally  arise  from  severance  related  to  workforce reductions and facility exit costs.  We are continuously evaluating our cost structure and have implemented restructuring actions in an effort to keep our cost structure competitive. The FAS/CAS operating adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of our pension and postretirement benefit (PRB)  expense  under  the  Financial Accounting  Standards  (FAS)  requirements  of  U.S.  GAAP  and  our  pension  and  PRB  expense  under  U.S.  government  Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), primarily related to our Raytheon segment.

      "question": "How did RTX's CAS expense evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does the multi-year trajectory reveal about the company's pension cost recognition under U.S. government CAS compared to FAS service cost trends?",
      "answer": "RTX's CAS expense decreased from $1,735 million in 2022 to $1,272 million in 2023, and further declined to $971 million in 2024. This consistent downward trend indicates a strategic shift or favorable change in pension cost recognition under U.S. government CAS, contrasting with the more volatile FAS service cost, which stood at $336 million in 2022, $145 million in 2023, and $138 million in 2024. The narrowing gap between CAS and FAS service cost, as reflected in the FAS/CAS operating adjustment ($1,399 million in 2022, $1,127 million in 2023, and $833 million in 2024), suggests that RTX's pension expense under CAS is aligning more closely with its GAAP-based FAS service cost over time.",

The  fair  value  for  acquired  customer  relationship  intangibles  is  determined  as  of  the  acquisition  date  based  on  estimates  and  judgments  regarding expectations for the future after-tax  cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that ex isted on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of ex pected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.\n\nAlso included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. At December 31, 2024, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $3.3 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $5.5 billion. We assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms, including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value ex ceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill, we primarily utilize a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies. For the quantitative assessments of indefinitelived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method.  These quantitative assessments incorporate significant assumptions that include sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions.\n\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. We assessed all of our reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required.\n\nThe Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact our significant assumptions used in testing goodwill, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company's market capitalization, and general industry, market, and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge.\n\nWe also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing using a qualitative approach as of  October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. As noted above, our indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis involves significant assumptions that are subject to variability. Material changes in these assumptions could occur and result in impairments in future periods.\n\nContingent Liabilities. As described in 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory, and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts,  performance  and  operating  cost  guarantees,  employee  benefit  plans,  legal,  and  environmental,  health,  and  safety  matters.  In  particular,  the  design, development, production, and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these technologies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates.

      "answer": "In 2022, RTX emphasized the usefulness of organic change in Net Sales to assess underlying performance, particularly highlighting that Pratt & Whitney's results included the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging in Canada. By 2023, the company expanded its disclosure to break down the components of organic change more granularly, explicitly excluding acquisitions, divestitures, foreign exchange translation, restructuring costs, and FAS/CAS pension adjustments, especially for the Raytheon segment. In 2024, RTX maintained this detailed reporting structure but placed greater emphasis on the Raytheon segment's pension cost recovery through U.S. government pricing, signaling a strategic focus on defense contracts. This progression shows a shift from general transparency goals in 2022 to more detailed operational segmentation in 2023 and 2024, with increasing clarity around cost recovery mechanisms in defense-focused segments.",

However, in 2024, the metric declined again, showing a net cost of $(55) million. This volatile pattern suggests that Caterpillar's pension obligations were significantly influenced by market conditions, particularly due to mark-to-market adjustments, which were a loss of $606 million in 2022, $97 million in 2023, and increased to $154 million in 2024.

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's credit risk exposure through Total Customer Receivables evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of the Current category versus past due categories, and what does this reveal about the company's collection performance and customer payment behavior over time?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's credit risk exposure through Total Customer Receivables showed a significant shift from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the Current category was $5,372M, while the total past due categories (31-60, 61-90, and 91+ days) totaled $100M. By 2023, the Current category increased to $8,650M, with total past due categories rising to $92M. In 2024, the Current category remained at $8,650M, while total past due categories decreased to $82M. This pattern indicates that while Caterpillar significantly expanded its receivables base between 2022 and 2023, it experienced some improvement in collection performance or customer payment behavior in 2024, as evidenced by the decline in past due amounts from $92M to $82M despite maintaining the same Current category level.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's mark-to-market pension losses decreased significantly from $(833) million in 2022 to $(97) million in 2023, and further to $(154) million in 2024. This trajectory shows a sharp decline in losses between 2022 and 2023, followed by a reversal with an increase in losses in 2024. The pattern suggests improved pension fund performance and potentially revised actuarial assumptions in 2023, followed by market volatility or updated valuations in 2024 that increased the mark-to-market deficit.",

      "answer": "RTX consistently excluded the effects of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations from its organic Net Sales and Operating Profit calculations across 2022, 2023, and 2024, aiming to provide better year-over-year comparability. In 2022, the company explicitly stated that organic changes in Net Sales and Cost of Sales excluded foreign exchange effects alongside acquisitions, divestitures, and other non-recurring items. By 2023, RTX reinforced this exclusion, emphasizing that such transparency aids investors in understanding the underlying business performance. In 2024, RTX maintained the same policy but added a more detailed explanation of restructuring costs and FAS/CAS adjustments, indicating a maturing of its non-GAAP disclosure framework. The consistent exclusion of FX effects across all three years suggests RTX's strategic effort to stabilize financial reporting narratives despite external currency volatility.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [RTX](2022) \u2192 [Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Translation Fluctuations]: In 2022, RTX disclosed that the organic change in Net Sales and Operating Profit excluded the impact of foreign currency exchange rate translation fluctuations, among other factors like acquisitions and restructuring.",
        "Hop 2: [RTX](2023) \u2192 [Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Translation Fluctuations]: In 2023, RTX reiterated the exclusion of FX translation effects from organic Net Sales and Operating Profit, reinforcing its commitment to transparent and comparable financial reporting.",
        "Hop 3: [RTX](2024) \u2192 [Foreign Currency Exchange Rate Translation Fluctuations]: In 2024, RTX continued to exclude FX translation effects from organic performance metrics, while expanding the context to include more granular details on restructuring and FAS/CAS adjustments."

If the completed distributions of Carrier or Otis, in each case, or certain internal business separation transactions, were to fail to qualify for tax-free treatment, the Company could be subject to significant liabilities, and there could be material adverse impacts on the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity in future reporting periods.\n\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets. The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition. G oodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired in business combinations consist of patents, trademarks/tradenames, developed technology, customer relationships, and other intangible assets.  The  fair  value  for  acquired  customer  relationship  intangibles  is  determined  as  of  the  acquisition  date  based  on  estimates  and  judgments  regarding expectations for the future after-tax  cash flows arising from the follow-on revenue from customer relationships that ex isted on the acquisition date over their estimated lives, including the probability of ex pected future contract renewals and revenue, less a contributory assets charge, all of which is discounted to present value. The fair value of the trademark and tradename intangible assets are determined utilizing the relief from royalty method which is a form of the income approach. Under this method, a royalty rate based on observed market royalties is applied to projected revenue supporting the tradename and discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. See 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further details.\n\nAlso included within intangible assets are exclusivity assets, which are payments made to secure certain contractual rights to provide products on new commercial aerospace platforms. At December 31, 2024, our exclusivity assets, net of accumulated amortization, were approximately $3.3 billion, and our remaining estimated commitments, net of collaborator share, were approximately $5.5 billion. We assess the recoverability of these intangibles, which is dependent upon our assumptions around the future success and profitability of the underlying aircraft platforms, including the associated aftermarket revenue streams, and the related future cash flows.\n\nGoodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to impairment testing annually, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the asset might be impaired. The impairment test compares carrying values of the reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets to their estimated fair values. If the carrying value ex ceeds the fair value, then the carrying value is reduced to fair value. In testing our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we may perform both qualitative and quantitative assessments. For the quantitative assessments that are performed for goodwill, we primarily utilize a combination of discounted cash flows and market-based valuation methodologies. For the quantitative assessments of indefinitelived intangible assets, fair value is primarily based on the relief from royalty method.  These quantitative assessments incorporate significant assumptions that include sales growth rates, projected operating profit, terminal growth rates, discount rates, royalty rates, and comparable multiples from publicly traded companies in our industry. Such assumptions are subject to variability from year to year and are directly impacted by, among other things, global market conditions.\n\nWe completed our annual goodwill impairment testing as of October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill were necessary. We assessed all of our reporting units using qualitative factors to determine whether it was more likely than not that any individual reporting unit's fair value is less than its carrying value (step 0) and determined that no further testing was required.\n\nThe Company continuously monitors and evaluates relevant events and circumstances that could unfavorably impact our significant assumptions used in testing goodwill, including changes to U.S. treasury rates and equity risk premiums, tax rates, recent market valuations from transactions by comparable companies, volatility in the Company's market capitalization, and general industry, market, and macro-economic conditions. It is possible that future changes in such circumstances, or in the inputs and assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units, could require the Company to record a non-cash impairment charge.\n\nWe also completed our annual indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment testing using a qualitative approach as of  October 1, 2024 and determined that no adjustments to the carrying value of these assets were necessary. As noted above, our indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment analysis involves significant assumptions that are subject to variability. Material changes in these assumptions could occur and result in impairments in future periods.\n\nContingent Liabilities. As described in 'Note 17: Commitments and Contingencies' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K, contractual, regulatory, and other matters in the normal course of business may arise that subject us to claims or litigation, including with respect to matters relating to technical issues on programs, government contracts,  performance  and  operating  cost  guarantees,  employee  benefit  plans,  legal,  and  environmental,  health,  and  safety  matters.  In  particular,  the  design, development, production, and support of aerospace technologies is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these technologies may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, RTX consistently disclosed the organic change in Net Sales across its major segments\u2014Raytheon, Collins Aerospace, and Pratt & Whitney\u2014emphasizing non-GAAP measures to provide transparency into underlying performance. In 2022, RTX highlighted that these measures excluded acquisition and divestiture impacts and foreign exchange effects, particularly noting Pratt & Whitney's sensitivity to foreign exchange hedging. In 2023, RTX expanded the framework by explicitly excluding restructuring costs, FAS/CAS pension adjustments, and acquisition accounting effects, signaling a more refined approach to isolating core operational performance. By 2024, RTX maintained the same disclosure framework but shifted the FAS/CAS adjustment focus specifically to the Raytheon segment, indicating a strategic emphasis on cost recovery through U.S. government contracts. This evolution reveals a consistent but maturing analytical approach to measuring organic growth, with increasing specificity around cost structures and pass-through liabilities\u2014particularly pensions\u2014demonstrating how RTX manages long-term contracts and cost volatility in its defense and aerospace segments.",

      "answer": "General Dynamics' Technologies Segment Revenue was $12.9 billion in 2022, $12.9 billion in 2023, and $12.4 billion in 2024. Despite relatively stable revenue figures, the segment\u2019s contribution to consolidated revenue decreased from 32% in 2022 to 31% in 2023 and further to 27% in 2024. This decline suggests a relative shift in strategic emphasis toward other segments, even as the Technologies segment continued to manage key domains such as C5ISR, IT services, and space systems integration, including work with the Space Development Agency and undersea autonomy programs.",

The decrease in C5ISR solutions revenue was also due to approximately $115 of revenue in 2020 from a satellite communications business that was sold in the second quarter of that year. These decreases were offset partially by increased IT services revenue due to the ramp up of several new programs and higher volume on existing programs due to the reopening of, and increased access to, customer sites following limitations imposed in 2020 due to the pandemic.\n\nThe  Technologies  segment's  operating  margin  increased  60  basis  points  compared  with  2020  due  to favorable contract mix and reduced COVID-related impacts in our IT services business, particularly customer reimbursement of idle workforce cost at zero fee in 2020 and early 2021. Additionally, operating results in 2020 included  an  approximate  $40  loss  on  a  contract  with  a  non-U.S.  customer  from  schedule  delays  caused  by COVID-related travel restrictions, offset partially by a gain on the sale of the satellite communications business.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nWe expect the Technologies segment's 2022 revenue to be between $12.8 and $13 billion with operating margin of around 10%.\n\n## CORPORATE\n\nCorporate  operating  results  totaled  $84  in  2021  and  $56  in  2020  and  consisted  primarily  of  equity-based compensation expense.

In 2021, aircraft manufacturing operating earnings were also impacted negatively by the settlement of claims with a supplier related to the assignment of warranties following the end of G550 production.\n\nThese decreases were offset partially by increased aircraft services operating earnings due to higher volume and a favorable mix of aircraft services. The operating earnings variance also reflects restructuring actions taken in 2020 to adjust the workforce size to the revised production levels.\n\nOperating earnings in 2021 reflected higher G&amp;A/other expenses due primarily to increased R&amp;D expenses associated  with  ongoing  product  development  efforts,  including  flight  test  activities  for  the  G700,  which  is scheduled to enter  service  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2022.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, General Dynamics consistently disclosed that billed accounts receivable in the defense segments arose as work progressed under long-term contracts, with billings occurring periodically or upon milestone achievement, typically after revenue recognition, resulting in contract assets. In the Aerospace segment, the company received customer deposits upon contract execution or milestones, which were liquidated as revenue was recognized upon aircraft delivery. These disclosures remained structurally consistent across all three years, indicating stable revenue recognition policies. However, the repeated emphasis on contract-by-contract reporting of assets and liabilities suggests growing complexity or volume in contract management, especially as defense contracts with milestone-based billing and aerospace contracts with upfront deposits coexisted. This reveals a dual cash flow dynamic: delayed cash inflows in defense due to post-revenue billing and accelerated inflows in aerospace due to pre-revenue deposits.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Lockheed Martin's Space segment underwent significant transformation. In 2022, the segment absorbed the financial impact of the AWE program exit, which had previously contributed $885 million in sales in 2021. In 2023, the Space segment saw a significant increase in product costs\u2014$815 million\u2014driven by the ramp-up of the Next Generation Interceptor (NGI) development program and higher volume in the Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) program, signaling increased investment and operational intensity. By 2024, Lockheed Martin made a strategic acquisition of Terran Orbital for $314 million, integrating satellite design, production, and on-orbit support capabilities into the Space segment, thereby expanding its portfolio and signaling a clear intent to strengthen its position in the evolving space defense and commercial ecosystem. This 3-year trajectory shows a strategic pivot toward modernization, capability expansion, and consolidation in the space domain.",

We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international  customers  with  products  and  services  that  have  defense,  civil  and  commercial  applications,  with  our  principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. As described in 'Note 4 - Information on Business Segments', we operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space.\n\nOn June 30, 2021, the UK Ministry of Defence terminated the contract to operate the UK's nuclear deterrent program and assumed control of the entity that manages the program (referred to as the renationalization of the Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE program)). Accordingly,  the AWE  program's  ongoing  operations,  including  the  entity  that  manages  the  program,  are  no longer included in our financial results as of that date, however, during 2021, AWE generated sales of $885 million and operating profit of $18 million, which are included in Space's financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021. During the year ended December  31,  2020, AWE  generated  sales  of  $1.4  billion  and  operating  profit  of  $35  million,  which  are  included  in  Space's financial results for 2020.\n\nBasis of presentation - These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest  entities  if  we  are  the  primary  beneficiary.  We  eliminate  intercompany  balances  and  transactions  in  consolidation.  We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is  generally  longer  than  one  year.  This  primarily  impacts  receivables,  contract  assets,  inventories,  and  contract  liabilities.  We classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year.\n\nUse of estimates - We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP).  In  doing  so,  we  are  required  to  make  estimates  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  amounts  reported  in  the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets for impairment; income taxes including deferred income taxes; fair value measurements; and contingencies.\n\nRevenue Recognition -The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract  when  it  has  approval  and  commitment  from  both  parties,  the  rights  of  the  parties  are  identified,  payment  terms  are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing  requirements,  primarily  international  direct  commercial  sale  contracts,  we  are  required  to  obtain  certain  regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.\n\nUnder fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixedprice  contracts  have  a  performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.\n\nCost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into three types of cost-reimbursable contracts: costplus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an award fee that varies within  specified  limits  based  on  the  customer's  assessment  of  our  performance  against  a  predetermined  set  of  criteria,  such  as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e.,",

We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.\n\nWe selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses, investments and ventures at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses, investments or ventures that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with a different owner. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.\n\nOn September 9, 2024, we completed the sale of our Commercial Engine Solutions (CES) business, which was part of our Aeronautics business segment. We received $170 million in cash from the sale. G ains recognized from the sale in 2024 were not significant. The final gain is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital, indemnification, and tax  adjustments, which we ex pect to complete in 2025. This sale did not represent a strategic shift and the impacts to our consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash were not significant. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows for the CES business up to the divestiture date have not been reclassified to discontinued operations.\n\nOn October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $314 million, which will be included in our Space business segment. Terran Orbital's product and service offerings include satellite design, production, launch planning, mission operations, and on-orbit support for the aerospace and defense industries. We believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings, provide additional innovative solutions to meet our customers' emerging requirements, and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Terran Orbital.\n\n## U.S. Budget E nvironment\n\nWith approximately three quarters of our sales from the U.S. G overnment, U.S. G overnment spending levels, particularly defense spending, and timely funding thereof can affect our financial performance over the short and long term.\n\nOn March 22, 2024, the President signed into law the second Fiscal Y ear (FY ) 2024 Consolidated Appropriations package, which includes the DoD funding. This legislation reflects the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA) spending limit of $886 billion for National Defense, of which $842 billion was for the DoD base budget.\n\nThe  President's  FY   2025  budget  request  was  submitted  to  Congress  on  March  11,  2024,  initiating  the  FY   2025  defense  authorization  and  appropriations legislative process. The request included $895 billion for National Defense, of which $850 billion is for the DoD base budget, in keeping with the limit established by the FRA. While compression on overall requirements driven by the FRA limit is evident, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has stated the FY  2025 budget proposal meets their objectives of keeping National Defense Strategy priorities on track.\n\nOn April 24, 2024, the President signed a bill providing a total of $95 billion in additional supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, including funding for the restock of U.S. munitions capacity. Supplemental funding legislation is not subject to the FRA limits.\n\nThe House and Senate continue the legislative process on the FY  2025 budget. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Y ear 2025, signed by the President on December 24, 2024, is consistent with the FY  2025 President's Budget Request (PBR) and Congressionally mandated budget caps established by the FRA with a topline of $849.8 billion. The House Appropriations Committee also marked its bill at this same level. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, did not adhere to the FRA spending caps and marked budgets above the PBR, providing between a $21 billion and $25 billion increase over the PBR level. Regardless of toplines, all four Committees support additional funding for several of our programs, spread across our four business areas.\n\nCongress still needs to approve or revise the President's FY 2025 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY  2025 budget process to conclude. A second Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY  2025 passed the House and Senate on December 20, 2024, and was signed by the President on December 21, 2024. The bill funds U.S. G overnment operations through March 14, 2025. In addition to the Continuing Resolution, the President also signed the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act on December 21, 2024, which includes more than $100 billion in supplemental funding. Of note, the final version of the bill did",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's FAS pension service cost decreased from $87 million in 2022 to $65 million in 2023, and further to $60 million in 2024. Over the same period, the CAS pension cost declined from $1,796 million in 2022 to $1,725 million in 2023, and then to $1,684 million in 2024. The FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment also decreased, from $1,709 million in 2022 to $1,660 million in 2023 and $1,624 million in 2024. This consistent decline in both FAS pension service cost and CAS pension cost suggests that Lockheed Martin's pension obligations, particularly the service-related component, have been reducing relative to its contractual accounting service (CAS) costs over the three-year period.",

      "question": "How did Lockheed Martin's RMS segment evolve from 2022 through 2024 in terms of restructuring costs, operational integration, and performance management?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's RMS segment underwent significant restructuring and operational evolution from 2022 through 2024. In 2022, the company recorded $100 million in severance and asset impairment charges specifically tied to RMS, reflecting a strategic review aimed at improving efficiency and aligning with program lifecycle changes. This action marked the beginning of a focused effort to streamline the segment. In 2023, RMS was formally integrated as one of the four core business segments (Aeronautics, MFC, RMS, and Space), indicating its strategic importance and operational maturity within the company's structure. By 2024, the restructuring efforts had expanded into broader corporate efficiency initiatives, with $92 million in severance and charges recorded across the corporation, though RMS remained a key focus area. The multi-year restructuring actions, totaling at least $192 million from 2022\u20132024, reflect a consistent effort to enhance operational efficiency and align the RMS segment with evolving defense market demands and internal performance standards.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe  have  a  number  of  programs  that  are  designated  as  classified  by  the  U.S.  Government  which  cannot  be  specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subjected to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.\n\nOur net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well  as  FMS  contracted  through  the  U.S.  Government.  We  recognize  revenue  as  performance  obligations  are  satisfied  and  the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. Lower than expected supply chain activity negatively affected our net sales during 2021.\n\nChanges in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume. Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts.  V olume  changes  in  segment  operating  profit  are  typically  based  on  the  current  profit  booking  rate  for  a  particular contract.\n\nIn  addition,  comparability  of  our  segment  sales,  operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-ofcompletion cost-to-cost method to measure progress towards completion. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as risk retirements, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nOur  consolidated  net  adjustments  not  related  to  volume,  including  net  profit  booking  rate  adjustments  and  other  matters, increased  segment  operating  profit  by  approximately  $2.0  billion  in  2021  and  $1.8  billion  in  2020.  The  consolidated  net adjustments in 2021 compared to 2020 increased primarily due to increases in profit booking rate adjustments at Space, MFC and RMS offset by a decrease in Aeronautics. The consolidated net adjustments for 2021 are inclusive of approximately $900 million in unfavorable items, which include reserves for a classified program at Aeronautics, various programs at RMS and a commercial ground  solutions  program  at  Space.  The  consolidated  net  adjustments  for  2020  are  inclusive  of  approximately  $745  million  in unfavorable items, which include reserves for various programs at RMS, government satellite programs at Space and performance matters on a sensors and global sustainment international military program at MFC.\n\nWe  periodically  experience  performance  issues  and  record  losses  for  certain  programs.  For  further  discussion  on  certain programs at Aeronautics  and  RMS,  see  'Note  1  -  Organization  and  Significant Accounting  Policies'  included  in  our  Notes  to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.",

The decrease in C5ISR solutions revenue was also due to approximately $115 of revenue in 2020 from a satellite communications business that was sold in the second quarter of that year. These decreases were offset partially by increased IT services revenue due to the ramp up of several new programs and higher volume on existing programs due to the reopening of, and increased access to, customer sites following limitations imposed in 2020 due to the pandemic.\n\nThe  Technologies  segment's  operating  margin  increased  60  basis  points  compared  with  2020  due  to favorable contract mix and reduced COVID-related impacts in our IT services business, particularly customer reimbursement of idle workforce cost at zero fee in 2020 and early 2021. Additionally, operating results in 2020 included  an  approximate  $40  loss  on  a  contract  with  a  non-U.S.  customer  from  schedule  delays  caused  by COVID-related travel restrictions, offset partially by a gain on the sale of the satellite communications business.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nWe expect the Technologies segment's 2022 revenue to be between $12.8 and $13 billion with operating margin of around 10%.\n\n## CORPORATE\n\nCorporate  operating  results  totaled  $84  in  2021  and  $56  in  2020  and  consisted  primarily  of  equity-based compensation expense.

      "question": "How did General Dynamics' treatment and reporting of Billed Accounts Receivable evolve across fiscal years 2022, 2023, and 2024, particularly in terms of billing practices, revenue recognition timing, and contract asset/liability disclosures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, General Dynamics described that billing typically follows revenue recognition in its defense segments, resulting in contract assets, while customer advances, particularly on international contracts, create contract liabilities. In 2023, the company reiterated this pattern but emphasized that billed accounts receivable, unbilled receivables, and customer advances are reported on a contract-by-contract basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, aligning with long-term contract accounting practices. In 2024, GD further clarified that in the defense segments, billing occurs periodically or upon milestone achievement, and in the Aerospace segment, deposits are received upon contract execution and milestones, which are liquidated upon revenue recognition. The 3-year trend shows a consistent but increasingly detailed disclosure around contract balances, with a focus on transparency in contract asset and liability reporting.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's Total Net Periodic Benefit Cost (Benefit) showed a significant transformation from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the company reported a net periodic benefit cost of $121 million, largely influenced by a $606 million mark-to-market loss. In 2023, the total shifted to a net benefit of $60 million despite a $97 million mark-to-market loss, indicating a partial recovery. By 2024, the total net periodic benefit cost was a smaller net cost of $55 million, with the mark-to-market loss increasing to $154 million. This evolution reveals that while Caterpillar faced ongoing pension funding pressures, especially from mark-to-market adjustments, the overall net cost improved significantly by 2024, suggesting better pension fund performance or strategic adjustments in liability management.",

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's 91+ days past due receivables in Latin America evolve from 2022 to 2024, and how does this Latin America trend compare to the company's overall delinquency performance across the same period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar reported $10 million in 91+ days past due receivables in Latin America. By 2023, this figure increased to $11 million before declining to $2 million in 2024. During the same period, Caterpillar's overall 91+ days past due receivables showed a different trajectory: increasing from $55 million in 2022 to $55 million in 2023, and then decreasing to $22 million in 2024. This indicates that while the company's overall delinquency performance followed a similar pattern across years, the Latin American region exhibited more volatility, particularly with the significant drop in 2024 that contrasted with the broader trend.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's mark-to-market loss (gain) fluctuated significantly from 2022 to 2024. In 2022, the company reported a mark-to-market loss of $606 million, which decreased to $97 million in 2023, indicating an improvement in the valuation of its pension obligations. However, in 2024, the mark-to-market loss increased sharply to $154 million, signaling a reversal in that trend. This trajectory suggests that while Caterpillar experienced a temporary stabilization in its pension fund liabilities in 2023, 2024 saw renewed financial pressure, potentially due to market volatility or changes in interest rates affecting the valuation of pension assets and liabilities.",

      "question": "How did the revenue distribution across Boeing's business segments evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this multi-year progression indicate about the company's strategic focus and financial resilience?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing's revenue was primarily distributed across its Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space & Security, and Global Services segments, with Commercial Airplanes contributing the largest share. By 2023, the proportion of revenue from Defense, Space & Security increased slightly, reflecting stronger government contracts and defense demand. In 2024, following the acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems (as noted in the 2024 disclosures), the revenue segmentation shifted again, with a more pronounced integration of supply chain capabilities and a corresponding increase in Global Services revenue. This evolution shows a strategic pivot toward strengthening defense and services portfolios while stabilizing commercial operations, indicating a shift toward diversified, more resilient revenue streams.",

      "question": "How did Boeing's airplane financing commitments evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's liquidity risk and strategic investment in commercial aircraft production?",
      "answer": "Boeing's airplane financing commitments increased from $12.9 billion in 2022 to $17.0 billion in 2023, and remained high at $17.1 billion in 2024. This upward trend indicates a significant and sustained financial obligation tied to its commercial aircraft business. Despite a reduction in overall debt from 2022 ($58.1 billion) to 2023 ($52.3 billion), the company saw a rebound in debt in 2024 ($53.9 billion), suggesting that financing commitments remained a core part of Boeing\u2019s capital structure. The continued increase and stabilization of airplane financing commitments over the three-year period signal ongoing strategic investment in commercial aircraft production, even amid liquidity pressures, negative operating cash flows, and credit rating risks. This evolution reflects both Boeing's long-term commitment to the commercial market and the increasing financial strain associated with fulfilling aircraft delivery obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nimproperly report on our progress toward achieving our environmental goals and commitments, the resulting negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation and/or our access to capital.\n\n## Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity\n\nWe may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts.\n\nWe depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. In addition, our debt balances have increased significantly since 2019, driven primarily by impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue to actively manage our liquidity. Our increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2021, our debt totaled $58.1 billion of which approximately  $11.4  billion  of  principal  payments  on  outstanding  debt  become  due  over  the  next  three  years.  In addition, as of December 31, 2021, our airplane financing commitments totaled $12.9 billion. If we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to the 737 MAX, COVID-19, 787  production  issues  or  broader  market  developments,  fund  outstanding  financing  commitments  or  meet  other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater  difficulty  accessing  public  and  private  markets  for  debt.  These  factors  include  disruptions  or  declines  in  the global  capital  markets  and/or  a  decline  in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit  ratings,  including  impacts described  above  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and/or  associated  changes  in  demand  for  our  products  and services.  The  occurrence  of  any  or  all  of  these  events  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and contractual or financing commitments.\n\n## Substantial  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  have  a  material  impact  on  our  earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.\n\nMany of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Potential  pension  contributions include  both  mandatory  amounts  required  under  the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  and  discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For  U.S.  government  contracts,  we  allocate  pension  costs  to  individual  contracts  based  on  U.S.  Cost  Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of  future  costs  associated  with  these  benefits  are  also  subject  to  assumptions,  including  estimates  of  the  level  of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies &amp; Estimates  -  Pension  Plans'  on  pages  54  -  55  of  this  Form  10-K.  Although  under  Generally  Accepted  Accounting Principles  in  the  United  States  of  America  (GAAP)  the  timing  of  periodic  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.\n\n## Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\n\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S.",

If we fail to achiev e or inadequately report our progress toward achiev ing such goals and commitments, the resulting negativ e publicity could adv ersely affect our reputation and/or our access to capital.\n\n## Risks Related to Financing and Liquidity\n\n## We may be unable to effectively manage our liquidity, which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\n\nWe depend, in part, on our ability to successfully access the capital and financial markets to fund our operations and contractual commitments. Net cash used by operating activ ities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $12.1 billion and we expect negativ e operating cash flows to continue in future quarters as we work to ramp up commercial airplanes production. As of December 31, 2024, our debt totaled $53.9 billion, of which approximately $13.6 billion of principal payments on outstanding debt are scheduled to become due ov er the next three years, and our airplane financing commitments totaled $17.1 billion. In addition, we will assume Spirit's net debt upon the closing of our acquisition of Spirit, which is expected to occur later this year. We also expect to require up to $345 million of cash per year for the payment of div idends on the outstanding shares of our 6.00% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Mandatory conv ertible preferred stock), through the mandatory conv ersion date of October 15, 2027. Div idends accumulate at a rate per annum equal to 6.00% on the liquidation preference thereof, which is $1,000.00 per share, payable when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. T he div idends, if declared, can be paid in cash, or subject to certain limitations, in shares of our common stock, or a combination of both. Any unpaid div idends will continue to accumulate. If div idends hav e not been declared and paid for six or more div idend periods, whether or not for consecutiv e div idend  periods,  the  holders  of  such  shares  of  Mandatory  conv ertible  preferred  stock,  will  be  entitled  at  our  next  annual  or  special  meeting  of shareholders to v ote for the election of two additional members of our Board of Directors, subject to certain limitations. If we require additional capital to support our operations, pay off existing debt, address impacts to our business related to market dev elopments, fund div idend payments or outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, reduce or delay capital inv estments, or issue equity, equity-linked or debt securities, and these activ ities could hav e terms that are unfav orable or could be dilutiv e. If we are unable to access the capital or financial markets at competitiv e rates, on terms acceptable to us or in sufficient amounts, or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectiv ely, our business, financial position and results of operations would be adv ersely affected.\n\nWe have in the past experienced and could in the future experience further downgrades in our credit ratings. Any such downgrades, as well as other factors including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, a decline in our financial performance or outlook, a delay in our ability to ramp up production and deliv eries, and changes in demand for our products and serv ices, could increase the cost of borrowing, jeopardize our ability to incur debt on  terms  acceptable  to  us,  and  negativ ely  impact  our  access  to  the  capital  and  financial  markets  and  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and commitments. We cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain an inv estment grade rating, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further rev iew for a downgrade, may impact us in a similar manner and have a negativ e impact on our liquidity, financial position, and access to the capital or financial markets.",

      "answer": "Boeing's antidilutive share count increased steadily from 3.5 million in 2022 to 5.7 million in 2023, and further to 11.6 million in 2024. This upward trajectory indicates mounting capital structure pressures, as the company continued to operate at a net loss, leading to more potential common shares being excluded from diluted loss per share calculations due to their antidilutive effect. The doubling of excluded shares between 2023 and 2024 suggests intensifying financial stress and growing equity dilution risks.",

Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.\n\nWe provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet  specified  aircraft  performance  targets.  We  account  for  these  performance  guarantees  as  warranties.  The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the  related  aircraft.  We  have  agreements  that  require  certain  suppliers  to  compensate  us  for  amounts  paid  to customers  for  failure  of  supplied  equipment  to  meet  specified  performance  targets.  Claims  against  suppliers  under these agreements are included in Inventories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft.  These  performance  warranties  and  claims  against  suppliers  are  included  in  the  programs'  estimate  at completion.\n\n## Supplier Penalties\n\nWe record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred  and  the  amount  is  reasonably  estimable.  Until  an  event  occurs,  we  fully  anticipate  accepting  all  products procured under production-related contracts.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nWe record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor's default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable. At inception of a guarantee, and adjusted each quarter, we also recognize a liability for the expected contingent loss.\n\n## Note 2 - Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles\n\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Warranties\n\nIn conjunction with certain product sales, we prov ide warranties that cov er factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. The majority of our warranties are issued by our BCA segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-year standard warranty for systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  and  software  manufactured  by  us  or  manufactured  to  certain  standards  under  our  authorization.  T hese warranties are included in the estimates to complete the related programs. On occasion we hav e made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation  to  correct  fleet-wide  major  issues  of  a  particular  model,  resulting  in  additional  accrued  warranty  expense.  Warranties  issued  by  our  BDS segment  principally  relate  to  sales  of  military  aircraft  and  weapons  systems.  T hese  sales  are  generally  accompanied  by  a six  month to two-year warranty period and cov er systems, accessories, equipment, parts and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related  to  standard  warranties  are  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  related  product  deliv ery  occurs.  T he  warranty  liability  recorded  at  each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty cov erage outstanding for products deliv ered times the av erage of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims lev el. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.\n\nWe provide guarantees to certain commercial aircraft customers which include compensation prov isions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational  characteristics  and  forecasted  customer  operation  of  the  aircraft  relativ e  to  contractually  specified  performance  targets,  and  anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of rev enue at deliv ery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inv entories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at deliv ery of the related aircraft. T hese performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in estimates to complete the related programs.\n\n## Supplier Penalties\n\nWe may incur penalties to suppliers under certain circumstances such as a contract termination. We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable we will incur a supplier penalty and the amount is reasonably estimable.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nAt the inception of a guarantee, we record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair v alue of the guarantee. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present v alue of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor's default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recov ery, if applicable. We also recognize a liability for the expected contingent loss at inception and adjust it each quarter.",

      "question": "How did Boeing's business segment reporting evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of segment revenue contributions and operational performance across its key divisions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing disclosed its business segment data in the 10-K filing, providing a breakdown of its major segments including Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space & Security, and Global Services, with each segment's revenue and operating performance detailed in Note 22. In 2023, the company maintained a similar structure in its disclosures, with segment and revenue information provided in Note 22, but with increased emphasis on defense contracts and international sales, reflecting a strategic pivot toward more stable government revenue streams. By 2024, following the Spirit Acquisition detailed in Note 2, Boeing's segment reporting included integration costs and realigned operational metrics, showing a shift in segment composition and performance due to the acquisition's impact on the supply chain and production capabilities. The evolution of these disclosures reveals a company adapting its segment structure in response to external pressures, including supply chain disruptions and defense market opportunities.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, the pre-tax impact of discount rate changes on UPS's pension and postretirement medical plans shifted dramatically: from a $21.1 billion gain in 2022, to a $2.3 billion loss in 2023, and finally to a $127 million gain in 2024. This reveals a significant volatility in UPS's pension liabilities due to fluctuating interest rates, with the company experiencing both large gains and losses over the three-year span as discount rates rose sharply in 2022, then declined in 2023, and modestly increased again in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

      "answer": "UPS's total self-insurance reserves increased from $2,887 million in 2022 to $2,946 million in 2023, and further to $2,981 million in 2024. This represents a steady upward trend of $94 million over the three-year period. The growth in reserves, primarily driven by increases in current reserves (from $1,069 million in 2022 to $1,320 million in 2023, before declining slightly to $1,086 million in 2024), suggests that UPS may have experienced higher short-term claims exposure in 2023, followed by a partial stabilization in 2024. Meanwhile, non-current reserves fluctuated but generally trended upward, rising from $1,818 million in 2022 to $1,895 million in 2024. This pattern indicates a growing long-term liability outlook, potentially reflecting increased risk exposure or a more conservative actuarial assessment of future claims obligations over the period.",

      "question": "How did the consistency of UPS's operating days from 255 in 2022 to 254 in 2023 and 253 in 2024 enable the company to maintain or increase average revenue per piece despite declining package volumes across all three years?",
      "answer": "UPS maintained nearly consistent operating days across the three-year period\u2014255 in 2022, 254 in 2023, and 253 in 2024\u2014providing operational stability. Despite this consistency, daily package volumes declined: total average daily package volume dropped from 20,787,000 in 2022 to 19,030,000 in 2023 and remained at 19,161,000 in 2024. During the same period, UPS implemented pricing strategies that led to increases in average revenue per piece\u2014rising from $12.11 in 2022 to $12.40 in 2023 and slightly adjusting to $12.34 in 2024. This suggests that UPS leveraged its stable network capacity (via consistent operating days) to offset volume declines through yield management, focusing on higher-margin services like Deferred and Next Day Air, which saw price increases of 8.5% and 4.8%, respectively, in 2024. The combination of stable operating days and strategic pricing helped UPS preserve margins even amid reduced shipment volumes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2022) \u2192 Operating Days in Period: Operating days were 255 in 2022, serving as a baseline for network capacity and operational rhythm.",
        "Hop 2: UPS(2023) \u2192 Operating Days in Period: Operating days remained stable at 254 in 2023, despite a drop in total daily package volume to 19,030,000 from 20,787,000 in 2022.",
        "Hop 3: UPS(2024) \u2192 Operating Days in Period: Operating days slightly decreased to 253 in 2024, with total daily package volume remaining flat at 19,161,000, while average revenue per piece slightly declined to $12.34 from $12.40 in 2023."

      "question": "How did the volume and revenue per piece for UPS's Deferred product change from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend indicate about customer behavior and pricing dynamics in the parcel delivery market?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS's Deferred volume declined significantly, dropping from 1,553 thousand packages per day in 2022 to 1,224 thousand in 2023, and further to 1,058 thousand in 2024\u2014a cumulative decrease of 31.8%. Despite this volume decline, revenue per piece for Deferred increased steadily: from $15.07 in 2022 to $16.38 in 2023, and then to $17.77 in 2024, representing a total increase of 17.9%. This divergence suggests that UPS successfully implemented pricing strategies to offset lower volume, potentially reflecting a shift in customer preference toward faster delivery options or a contraction in the market segment relying on cost-sensitive, slower shipping methods.",

          "chunk_text": "## UNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nBusiness-to-consumer shipments represented approximately 60.7% of average daily volume compared to 63.6% in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\n\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\n\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\n\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's ('DOE') Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic Air and Ground products were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "The underfunded status of UPS's U.S. Postretirement Medical Benefit Plans persisted across all three years: in 2022, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation exceeded plan assets; this underfunded condition remained unchanged in 2023 and was again reported in 2024. The consistent disclosure of a funding shortfall over this period indicates that UPS did not make progress in closing the gap between its postretirement medical obligations and the assets set aside to meet those liabilities, suggesting ongoing pressure on the company's long-term healthcare cost structure.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Segment and Revenue Information (Note 22) highlighted that Commercial Airplanes represented the largest portion of revenue at $66.1B, with Defense, Space & Security contributing $26.5B, and Global Services at $17.8B. By 2023, Commercial Airplanes revenue declined to $60.8B, while Defense, Space & Security grew slightly to $27.1B and Global Services remained stable at $17.6B. In 2024, Commercial Airplanes revenue rebounded to $63.4B, Defense, Space & Security increased further to $28.3B, and Global Services rose to $18.9B. This trend indicates a relative stabilization in Commercial Airplanes performance after a dip in 2023, with Defense and Global Services showing consistent growth, suggesting a strategic shift toward diversifying revenue streams beyond commercial aviation.",

This upward trend indicates growing capital obligations tied to aircraft production, reflecting the company's ongoing challenges in managing liquidity while attempting to scale commercial production and integrate acquisitions like Spirit.

Net cash used by operating activ ities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $12.1 billion and we expect negativ e operating cash flows to continue in future quarters as we work to ramp up commercial airplanes production. As of December 31, 2024, our debt totaled $53.9 billion, of which approximately $13.6 billion of principal payments on outstanding debt are scheduled to become due ov er the next three years, and our airplane financing commitments totaled $17.1 billion. In addition, we will assume Spirit's net debt upon the closing of our acquisition of Spirit, which is expected to occur later this year. We also expect to require up to $345 million of cash per year for the payment of div idends on the outstanding shares of our 6.00% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Mandatory conv ertible preferred stock), through the mandatory conv ersion date of October 15, 2027. Div idends accumulate at a rate per annum equal to 6.00% on the liquidation preference thereof, which is $1,000.00 per share, payable when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. T he div idends, if declared, can be paid in cash, or subject to certain limitations, in shares of our common stock, or a combination of both. Any unpaid div idends will continue to accumulate. If div idends hav e not been declared and paid for six or more div idend periods, whether or not for consecutiv e div idend  periods,  the  holders  of  such  shares  of  Mandatory  conv ertible  preferred  stock,  will  be  entitled  at  our  next  annual  or  special  meeting  of shareholders to v ote for the election of two additional members of our Board of Directors, subject to certain limitations. If we require additional capital to support our operations, pay off existing debt, address impacts to our business related to market dev elopments, fund div idend payments or outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, reduce or delay capital inv estments, or issue equity, equity-linked or debt securities, and these activ ities could hav e terms that are unfav orable or could be dilutiv e. If we are unable to access the capital or financial markets at competitiv e rates, on terms acceptable to us or in sufficient amounts, or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectiv ely, our business, financial position and results of operations would be adv ersely affected.\n\nWe have in the past experienced and could in the future experience further downgrades in our credit ratings. Any such downgrades, as well as other factors including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, a decline in our financial performance or outlook, a delay in our ability to ramp up production and deliv eries, and changes in demand for our products and serv ices, could increase the cost of borrowing, jeopardize our ability to incur debt on  terms  acceptable  to  us,  and  negativ ely  impact  our  access  to  the  capital  and  financial  markets  and  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and commitments. We cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain an inv estment grade rating, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further rev iew for a downgrade, may impact us in a similar manner and have a negativ e impact on our liquidity, financial position, and access to the capital or financial markets.",

In addition, our debt balances have increased significantly since 2019, driven primarily by impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue to actively manage our liquidity. Our increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2021, our debt totaled $58.1 billion of which approximately  $11.4  billion  of  principal  payments  on  outstanding  debt  become  due  over  the  next  three  years.  In addition, as of December 31, 2021, our airplane financing commitments totaled $12.9 billion. If we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to the 737 MAX, COVID-19, 787  production  issues  or  broader  market  developments,  fund  outstanding  financing  commitments  or  meet  other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater  difficulty  accessing  public  and  private  markets  for  debt.  These  factors  include  disruptions  or  declines  in  the global  capital  markets  and/or  a  decline  in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit  ratings,  including  impacts described  above  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and/or  associated  changes  in  demand  for  our  products  and services.  The  occurrence  of  any  or  all  of  these  events  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and contractual or financing commitments.\n\n## Substantial  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  have  a  material  impact  on  our  earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.\n\nMany of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Potential  pension  contributions include  both  mandatory  amounts  required  under  the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  and  discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For  U.S.  government  contracts,  we  allocate  pension  costs  to  individual  contracts  based  on  U.S.  Cost  Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of  future  costs  associated  with  these  benefits  are  also  subject  to  assumptions,  including  estimates  of  the  level  of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies &amp; Estimates  -  Pension  Plans'  on  pages  54  -  55  of  this  Form  10-K.  Although  under  Generally  Accepted  Accounting Principles  in  the  United  States  of  America  (GAAP)  the  timing  of  periodic  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.\n\n## Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\n\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S.",

      "question": "How did Boeing's accrual policy and disclosure around supplier penalties evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in relation to contract terminations and the probability of incurring such penalties?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Boeing's policy on supplier penalties remained consistently tied to the occurrence of triggering events, such as contract terminations, but the specificity and framing of the disclosures evolved. In 2022, Boeing emphasized that it 'fully anticipates accepting all products procured under production-related contracts' until an event occurs, indicating a strong presumption against penalties unless explicitly triggered. In 2023, the language became more structured, stating that accruals are made when an event makes it 'probable' that a penalty will be incurred and the amount is 'reasonably estimable.' By 2024, the disclosure remained materially unchanged from 2023, maintaining the 'probable and reasonably estimable' threshold, suggesting a stabilization in both policy and disclosure clarity. This progression indicates a move from a default assumption of compliance in 2022 toward a more condition-based, transparent accrual policy by 2023 and 2024.",

The majority of our warranties are issued by our BCA segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-year standard warranty for systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  and  software  manufactured  by  us  or  manufactured  to  certain  standards  under  our  authorization.  T hese warranties are included in the estimates to complete the related programs. On occasion we hav e made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation  to  correct  fleet-wide  major  issues  of  a  particular  model,  resulting  in  additional  accrued  warranty  expense.  Warranties  issued  by  our  BDS segment  principally  relate  to  sales  of  military  aircraft  and  weapons  systems.  T hese  sales  are  generally  accompanied  by  a six  month to two-year warranty period and cov er systems, accessories, equipment, parts and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related  to  standard  warranties  are  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  related  product  deliv ery  occurs.  T he  warranty  liability  recorded  at  each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty cov erage outstanding for products deliv ered times the av erage of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims lev el. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.\n\nWe provide guarantees to certain commercial aircraft customers which include compensation prov isions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational  characteristics  and  forecasted  customer  operation  of  the  aircraft  relativ e  to  contractually  specified  performance  targets,  and  anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of rev enue at deliv ery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inv entories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at deliv ery of the related aircraft. T hese performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in estimates to complete the related programs.\n\n## Supplier Penalties\n\nWe may incur penalties to suppliers under certain circumstances such as a contract termination. We record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable we will incur a supplier penalty and the amount is reasonably estimable.\n\n## Guarantees\n\nAt the inception of a guarantee, we record a liability in Accrued liabilities for the fair v alue of the guarantee. For credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present v alue of the expected loss. We determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditor's default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recov ery, if applicable. We also recognize a liability for the expected contingent loss at inception and adjust it each quarter.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, 3M's financial impact from divestiture-related restructuring actions showed fluctuation, reflecting evolving strategic moves and operational adjustments. In 2022, divestiture-related restructuring actions were reported at $0.05 per diluted share. In 2023, these actions increased slightly to $0.05 per diluted share but were offset by a $0.68 per diluted share cost related to divestitures. By 2024, corporate special items, which included divestiture-related restructuring actions, decreased year-over-year, indicating a reduction in such costs following the completion of major divestiture activities like the Solventum separation in April 2024. This trend suggests that 3M's divestiture strategy matured over time, with initial restructuring costs rising in 2023 before declining in 2024 as the company streamlined operations post-divestiture.",

Because Corporate and Unallocated and Other include a variety of miscellaneous items, they are subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. Corporate and Unallocated and Other are presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 22.\n\n- Corporate and Unallocated operating income (loss) includes 'corporate special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'.\n- Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters. In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were also included in corporate special items. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were not included in the Corporate net costs for significant litigation special item, instead being reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Corporate special items for the periods presented also include divestiture costs, gain on business divestitures, divestiture-related restructuring actions and Russia ex it charges/benefits. Divestiture costs include costs that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\n- Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details on the impact of special items for additional information on the components of corporate special items. Corporate special item net costs decreased year-over-year in 2024, primarily due to lower net costs for significant litigation associated with Corporate and Unallocated. Corporate special item net costs increased year-over-year in 2023, primarily due to increased net costs for significant litigation as a result of pre-tax  charges of $10.3 billion and $4.2 billion in the second and third quarters of 2023 related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement, respectively (both discussed in Note 19), and lower gains on business divestitures.\n- Other corporate expense-net includes certain enterprise and governance activities resulting in unallocated corporate costs and other activity and net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations, commercial activity with Solventum postSeparation, and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Other corporate operating expenses, net, decreased year-over-year in 2024 primarily due to the extent of non-discontinued operationseligible former Solventum-allocated costs included in Corporate and Unallocated prior to Solventum's April 2024 Separation. Other corporate operating expenses, net, increased year-over-year in 2023 primarily due to higher restructuring charges (see Note 6).\n\n## \u00b7 Other:\n\n- This category principally reflects activity associated with:\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operating income categorized as \"Other\" decreased year-over-year in 2024 primarily due to the extent of transition arrangement income from divested businesses (and associated costs) largely related to Solventum, which separated in April 2024. Operating income categorized as \"Other\" decreased year-over-year in 2023 as a result of divestiture of the Food Safety Division and dental local anesthetic businesses (both formerly part of the \"Other\" category) and the extent of transition arrangement income from divested businesses other than Solventum.",

Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\nCorporate and Unallocated net operating loss increased in 2021 when compared to 2020 primarily related to the pre-tax gain of $387 million included in special items in 2020 as a result of 3M's divestiture of its drug delivery business (see Note 3 for additional details).\n\n## Special Items\n\nRefer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section and Note 5 for additional details on the impact of significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring actions that are reflected in Corporate and Unallocated.\n\n## Other Corporate Expense - Net\n\nOther corporate operating expenses decreased in 2021 when compared to 2020. The decrease was primarily due to a $91 million pre-tax benefit from the impact of the favorable decision of the Brazilian Supreme Court in the second quarter of 2021 regarding the calculation of past social taxes, continued lower overall corporate staff spending and first quarter 2020 charges related to equity securities (as discussed in the 'Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis' section of Note 15), partially offset by increased legal and reserve adjustment costs.\n\n## Operating Business Segments:\n\nInformation related to 3M's business segments is presented in the tables that follow with additional context in the corresponding narrative below the tables.\n\nThe following discusses total year results for 2021 compared to 2020 and 2020 compared to 2019 for each business segment.\n\n## Safety and Industrial Business (36.4% of consolidated sales):\n\n",

      "answer": "MMM's 'Advanced Payments' deferred tax asset declined significantly from $286 million in 2022 to $76 million in 2023, and further dropped to just $14 million in 2024. This sharp, consistent decline over three years suggests a material reduction in customer prepayments or changes in contract structures that affect cash flow timing. The drop from $286 million to only $14 million over two years represents a 95% decrease, indicating a fundamental shift in how MMM is managing or recognizing advanced payments, potentially signaling tighter cash flow controls, changes in customer agreements, or a strategic pivot in business model dynamics.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM highlighted the Advanced Materials and Industries Segment as a key growth driver, noting its 12.1% organic growth and increased R&D investment aimed at expanding its portfolio in high-performance materials. By 2023, the segment's focus had shifted toward integration of recent acquisitions, with MMM emphasizing operational synergies and margin expansion, reflecting a more consolidation-oriented strategy. In 2024, MMM elevated the segment\u2019s strategic importance by aligning it more closely with its innovation pipeline, citing a 14.3% increase in capital expenditures dedicated to scaling advanced material platforms. Collectively, this progression shows MMM's shift from growth through innovation in 2022, to integration in 2023, and toward scaling and capital-intensive expansion in 2024.",

In addition, our debt balances have increased significantly since 2019, driven primarily by impacts related to the 737 MAX grounding and the COVID-19 pandemic, and we expect to continue to actively manage our liquidity. Our increased debt balance has also resulted in downgrades to our credit ratings. As of December 31, 2021, our debt totaled $58.1 billion of which approximately  $11.4  billion  of  principal  payments  on  outstanding  debt  become  due  over  the  next  three  years.  In addition, as of December 31, 2021, our airplane financing commitments totaled $12.9 billion. If we require additional funding in order to pay off existing debt, address further impacts to our business related to the 737 MAX, COVID-19, 787  production  issues  or  broader  market  developments,  fund  outstanding  financing  commitments  or  meet  other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. These risks will be particularly acute if we are subject to further credit rating downgrades. A number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater  difficulty  accessing  public  and  private  markets  for  debt.  These  factors  include  disruptions  or  declines  in  the global  capital  markets  and/or  a  decline  in  our  financial  performance,  outlook  or  credit  ratings,  including  impacts described  above  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and/or  associated  changes  in  demand  for  our  products  and services.  The  occurrence  of  any  or  all  of  these  events  may  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and contractual or financing commitments.\n\n## Substantial  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit  obligations  have  a  material  impact  on  our  earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows from operations, and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.\n\nMany of  our  employees  have  earned  benefits  under  defined  benefit  pension  plans.  Potential  pension  contributions include  both  mandatory  amounts  required  under  the  Employee  Retirement  Income  Security  Act  and  discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. The extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. For  U.S.  government  contracts,  we  allocate  pension  costs  to  individual  contracts  based  on  U.S.  Cost  Accounting Standards which can also affect contract profitability. We also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. Our estimates of  future  costs  associated  with  these  benefits  are  also  subject  to  assumptions,  including  estimates  of  the  level  of medical cost increases. For a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see 'Management's Discussion and Analysis - Critical Accounting Policies &amp; Estimates  -  Pension  Plans'  on  pages  54  -  55  of  this  Form  10-K.  Although  under  Generally  Accepted  Accounting Principles  in  the  United  States  of  America  (GAAP)  the  timing  of  periodic  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefit expense and plan contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect GAAP expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.\n\n## Our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.\n\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. We maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S.",

Net cash used by operating activ ities for the year ended December 31, 2024 was $12.1 billion and we expect negativ e operating cash flows to continue in future quarters as we work to ramp up commercial airplanes production. As of December 31, 2024, our debt totaled $53.9 billion, of which approximately $13.6 billion of principal payments on outstanding debt are scheduled to become due ov er the next three years, and our airplane financing commitments totaled $17.1 billion. In addition, we will assume Spirit's net debt upon the closing of our acquisition of Spirit, which is expected to occur later this year. We also expect to require up to $345 million of cash per year for the payment of div idends on the outstanding shares of our 6.00% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (Mandatory conv ertible preferred stock), through the mandatory conv ersion date of October 15, 2027. Div idends accumulate at a rate per annum equal to 6.00% on the liquidation preference thereof, which is $1,000.00 per share, payable when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors. T he div idends, if declared, can be paid in cash, or subject to certain limitations, in shares of our common stock, or a combination of both. Any unpaid div idends will continue to accumulate. If div idends hav e not been declared and paid for six or more div idend periods, whether or not for consecutiv e div idend  periods,  the  holders  of  such  shares  of  Mandatory  conv ertible  preferred  stock,  will  be  entitled  at  our  next  annual  or  special  meeting  of shareholders to v ote for the election of two additional members of our Board of Directors, subject to certain limitations. If we require additional capital to support our operations, pay off existing debt, address impacts to our business related to market dev elopments, fund div idend payments or outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, we may need to refinance or restructure our debt, reduce or delay capital inv estments, or issue equity, equity-linked or debt securities, and these activ ities could hav e terms that are unfav orable or could be dilutiv e. If we are unable to access the capital or financial markets at competitiv e rates, on terms acceptable to us or in sufficient amounts, or if we experience an increase in our borrowing costs or otherwise fail to manage our liquidity effectiv ely, our business, financial position and results of operations would be adv ersely affected.\n\nWe have in the past experienced and could in the future experience further downgrades in our credit ratings. Any such downgrades, as well as other factors including disruptions or declines in the global capital markets, a decline in our financial performance or outlook, a delay in our ability to ramp up production and deliv eries, and changes in demand for our products and serv ices, could increase the cost of borrowing, jeopardize our ability to incur debt on  terms  acceptable  to  us,  and  negativ ely  impact  our  access  to  the  capital  and  financial  markets  and  our  ability  to  fund  our  operations  and commitments. We cannot be assured that we will be able to maintain an inv estment grade rating, and any additional actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under further rev iew for a downgrade, may impact us in a similar manner and have a negativ e impact on our liquidity, financial position, and access to the capital or financial markets.",

      "question": "How has Boeing's exclusion of potential common shares from diluted loss per share calculations changed from 2022 to 2024, and what does this increasing trend indicate about their financial performance?",
      "answer": "The number of potential common shares excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share increased significantly over the three-year period: 3.5 million shares in 2022, 5.7 million in 2023, and 11.6 million in 2024. This increasing trend indicates a worsening financial position, as the company continued to incur net losses, making these shares antidilutive. The growing number of excluded shares suggests that Boeing's loss position deepened over time, particularly in 2024, which could raise concerns about long-term financial stability and recovery prospects for investors.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, BA maintained a consistent policy of recording supplier penalties only when an event occurs that makes it probable a penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. In 2022, BA explicitly stated that it anticipates accepting all procured products under production-related contracts unless a triggering event occurs. By 2023 and 2024, the language evolved to emphasize that penalties may be incurred under 'certain circumstances such as a contract termination,' indicating a growing emphasis on contract risk as a source of supplier penalties. While no specific dollar figures were disclosed, the increasing specificity around contract terminations suggests a heightened awareness of supplier risk, particularly in the context of performance guarantees where suppliers are contractually obligated to compensate BA for customer payouts due to equipment underperformance. This evolution reflects a more proactive stance in identifying and accounting for supplier-related financial exposures.",

The majority of our warranties are issued by our BCA segment. Generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a 3 to 4-year standard warranty for systems,  accessories,  equipment,  parts,  and  software  manufactured  by  us  or  manufactured  to  certain  standards  under  our  authorization.  T hese warranties are included in the estimates to complete the related programs. On occasion we hav e made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation  to  correct  fleet-wide  major  issues  of  a  particular  model,  resulting  in  additional  accrued  warranty  expense.  Warranties  issued  by  our  BDS segment  principally  relate  to  sales  of  military  aircraft  and  weapons  systems.  T hese  sales  are  generally  accompanied  by  a six  month to two-year warranty period and cov er systems, accessories, equipment, parts and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. Estimated costs related  to  standard  warranties  are  recorded  in  the  period  in  which  the  related  product  deliv ery  occurs.  T he  warranty  liability  recorded  at  each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty cov erage outstanding for products deliv ered times the av erage of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims lev el. Estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.\n\nWe provide guarantees to certain commercial aircraft customers which include compensation prov isions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. We account for these performance guarantees as warranties. The estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational  characteristics  and  forecasted  customer  operation  of  the  aircraft  relativ e  to  contractually  specified  performance  targets,  and  anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. Estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of rev enue at deliv ery of the related aircraft. We have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. Claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in Inv entories and recorded as a reduction in Cost of products at deliv ery of the related aircraft.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS experienced significant swings in actuarial gains and losses related to discount rate changes. In 2022, the company recorded a $21.1 billion pre-tax gain as the weighted-average discount rate increased from 3.11% to 5.77%. In 2023, this trend reversed sharply with a $2.3 billion pre-tax loss as the discount rate fell to 5.40%. By 2024, UPS saw a smaller $127 million pre-tax gain as the discount rate rose again to 5.85. This pattern reveals that UPS's pension liabilities are highly sensitive to interest rate movements, with large year-over-year volatility in gains and losses reflecting changes in discount rates.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## 2020 - $10.1 billion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n\n- Discount Rates ($7.3 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.3 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n- Demographic and Assumption Changes ($513 million pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n\n## Pension and Postretirement Plan Assets\n\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\n\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from 7.77% during 2020 to 6.50% in 2021.\n\n## Fair Value Measurements\n\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\n\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\n\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\n\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n\n- Hedge Funds: Plan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period,",

      "answer": "UPS's total self-insurance reserves were $2,903 million in 2022, increased slightly to $2,946 million in 2023, and then rose further to $2,981 million in 2024. This represents a steady upward trend of $78 million over the three-year period. The increase in total reserves, despite a decline in current reserves from $1,069 million in 2022 to $1,086 million in 2024, was primarily driven by a consistent rise in non-current self-insurance reserves, which grew from $1,855 million in 2022 to $1,895 million in 2024.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, UPS's Deferred product experienced a consistent decline in daily package volume, falling from 1,553 thousand in 2022 to 1,224 thousand in 2023, and further to 1,058 thousand in 2024\u2014a cumulative decrease of 31.9%. Despite this volume decline, revenue per piece for Deferred increased steadily: $15.07 in 2022, $16.38 in 2023, and $17.77 in 2024\u2014representing a 17.9% increase from 2022 to 2024. Total revenue for the Deferred product also declined each year: $5,968 million in 2022, $5,093 million in 2023, and $4,757 million in 2024. This indicates that while UPS was able to command higher pricing in the Deferred segment, the persistent volume erosion suggests a weakening demand or strategic shift away from this product, potentially signaling a repositioning in the less time-sensitive shipping market.",

The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\n\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\n\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\n\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's ('DOE') Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic Air and Ground products were as follows:\n\n",

In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were also included in corporate special items. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were not included in the Corporate net costs for significant litigation special item, instead being reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Corporate special items for the periods presented also include divestiture costs, gain on business divestitures, divestiture-related restructuring actions and Russia ex it charges/benefits. Divestiture costs include costs that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\n- Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details on the impact of special items for additional information on the components of corporate special items. Corporate special item net costs decreased year-over-year in 2024, primarily due to lower net costs for significant litigation associated with Corporate and Unallocated. Corporate special item net costs increased year-over-year in 2023, primarily due to increased net costs for significant litigation as a result of pre-tax  charges of $10.3 billion and $4.2 billion in the second and third quarters of 2023 related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement, respectively (both discussed in Note 19), and lower gains on business divestitures.\n- Other corporate expense-net includes certain enterprise and governance activities resulting in unallocated corporate costs and other activity and net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations, commercial activity with Solventum postSeparation, and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Other corporate operating expenses, net, decreased year-over-year in 2024 primarily due to the extent of non-discontinued operationseligible former Solventum-allocated costs included in Corporate and Unallocated prior to Solventum's April 2024 Separation.

In 2024, the segment's operating expenses were split between employee-related ($6 million) and asset-related/other costs ($14 million), totaling $20 million, a significant reduction from $238 million in 2023, driven largely by decreases in both categories.

      "answer": "MMM's deferred tax asset associated with Advanced Payments declined sharply from $286 million in 2022 to $76 million in 2023, and then to just $14 million in 2024. This consistent and steep reduction indicates a strategic shift in how MMM is managing or recognizing advanced payments for tax purposes, potentially signaling a move away from deferring tax liabilities linked to this category or a structural change in customer payment terms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MMM](2022) \u2192 [Advanced Payments]: In 2022, MMM reported a deferred tax asset of $286 million related to Advanced Payments, indicating a significant tax deferral impact from this category.",
        "Hop 2: [MMM](2023) \u2192 [Advanced Payments]: By 2023, the deferred tax asset tied to Advanced Payments had dropped to $76 million, a decrease of over 70%, suggesting a major change in the company\u2019s treatment or volume of advanced payments.",
        "Hop 3: [MMM](2024) \u2192 [Advanced Payments]: In 2024, the deferred tax asset for Advanced Payments was further reduced to just $14 million, continuing the downward trend and reinforcing a long-term shift in tax planning or revenue recognition strategy."

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM's Transportation and Electronics segment reported $9,769 million in net sales and $2,008 million in operating income, showing relatively stable performance compared to earlier years. By 2023, the segment experienced a 3.5% decline in organic sales, despite minor growth contributions from acquisitions (0.7%), resulting in an overall 4.5% decline in total sales, signaling emerging market or demand pressures. In 2024, following the separation of the Health Care business, MMM restructured its reporting segments, positioning Transportation and Electronics as one of only three continuing business segments, emphasizing its strategic importance. This evolution shows a shift from a relatively stable contributor in 2022 to a segment facing organic headwinds in 2023, and ultimately becoming a core pillar of MMM's post-2024 portfolio following the strategic refocusing of the company.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "question": "How did 3M's financial impact from divestiture-related restructuring actions evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year progression reveal about the company's divestiture strategy execution?",
      "answer": "In 2022, 3M reported a $0.05 per diluted share impact from divestiture-related restructuring actions. By 2023, this impact had ceased, with no such charge reflected in the earnings table. In 2024, the company noted a decrease in corporate special item net costs, partly due to lower divestiture-related restructuring actions. This trend indicates that 3M's divestiture strategy matured over time, with initial restructuring costs in 2022 tapering off by 2023 and further reducing in 2024, suggesting the completion or stabilization of major divestiture-related transitions.",

Because Corporate and Unallocated and Other include a variety of miscellaneous items, they are subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. Corporate and Unallocated and Other are presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 22.\n\n- Corporate and Unallocated operating income (loss) includes 'corporate special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'.\n- Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters. In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were also included in corporate special items. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were not included in the Corporate net costs for significant litigation special item, instead being reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Corporate special items for the periods presented also include divestiture costs, gain on business divestitures, divestiture-related restructuring actions and Russia ex it charges/benefits. Divestiture costs include costs that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\n- Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details on the impact of special items for additional information on the components of corporate special items. Corporate special item net costs decreased year-over-year in 2024, primarily due to lower net costs for significant litigation associated with Corporate and Unallocated. Corporate special item net costs increased year-over-year in 2023, primarily due to increased net costs for significant litigation as a result of pre-tax  charges of $10.3 billion and $4.2 billion in the second and third quarters of 2023 related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement, respectively (both discussed in Note 19), and lower gains on business divestitures.\n- Other corporate expense-net includes certain enterprise and governance activities resulting in unallocated corporate costs and other activity and net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations, commercial activity with Solventum postSeparation, and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Other corporate operating expenses, net, decreased year-over-year in 2024 primarily due to the extent of non-discontinued operationseligible former Solventum-allocated costs included in Corporate and Unallocated prior to Solventum's April 2024 Separation. Other corporate operating expenses, net, increased year-over-year in 2023 primarily due to higher restructuring charges (see Note 6).\n\n## \u00b7 Other:\n\n- This category principally reflects activity associated with:\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operating income categorized as \"Other\" decreased year-over-year in 2024 primarily due to the extent of transition arrangement income from divested businesses (and associated costs) largely related to Solventum, which separated in April 2024. Operating income categorized as \"Other\" decreased year-over-year in 2023 as a result of divestiture of the Food Safety Division and dental local anesthetic businesses (both formerly part of the \"Other\" category) and the extent of transition arrangement income from divested businesses other than Solventum.",

By 2023, the Corporate and Unallocated segment reported only $4 million in net sales, indicating minimal direct revenue generation from this segment. In 2024, MMM provided explicit operating expense figures, showing that Corporate and Unallocated carried $20 million in total operating expenses\u2014$6 million in employee-related costs and $14 million in asset-related and other expenses. This represents a significant reduction from 2023, where the segment had $238 million in total operating expenses (including $171 million employee-related and $67 million asset-related).

      "answer": "In 2022, 3M reported $286 million in deferred tax assets related to Advanced Payments. By 2023, this figure dropped significantly to $76 million, and in 2024, it further declined to just $14 million. This consistent decline over the three-year period indicates a strategic reduction in the use of advanced payments for tax deferral purposes or a shift in the company's operational or financial planning strategies that reduced reliance on such mechanisms.",
