      "question": "How did the change in HD's NOPAT from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023 impact their ROIC, and what does this reveal about their capital efficiency during this period?",
      "answer": "HD's ROIC decreased from 44.6% in fiscal 2022 to 36.7% in fiscal 2023, primarily driven by lower operating income and an increase in average long-term debt. Since ROIC is calculated using NOPAT divided by average debt and equity, the decline in NOPAT and the rise in debt directly affected the metric. This indicates a reduction in capital efficiency, as the company generated less return per unit of invested capital in fiscal 2023 compared to the prior year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: HD(2022) \u2192 NOPAT: HD disclosed NOPAT as a key financial metric in fiscal 2022, which directly feeds into the ROIC calculation.",
        "Hop 2: NOPAT \u2192 ROIC: ROIC is defined as NOPAT divided by average debt and equity, showing a direct dependency of ROIC on NOPAT.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Amazon reported that increased unit sales were a primary driver of improved operating income for North America, alongside advertising sales growth and despite rising fulfillment and technology costs. By 2024, North America sales increased by 10%, primarily reflecting further growth in unit sales, including contributions from third-party sellers, advertising, and subscription services. This growth was attributed to Amazon's ongoing focus on price, selection, and convenience, particularly through fast shipping offers. The 2024 sales growth builds directly on the momentum from 2023 unit sales increases, showing a consistent strategic driver across both years.",

This increase was partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies that reduced expenses by approximately 170 basis points. In 2024, store operating expenses were explicitly defined as including wages and benefits for store partners, occupancy costs, and delivery commissions, indicating a continued emphasis on labor costs as a core component of store-level expenditures. The company's evolving cost structure reflects a strategic trade-off between investing in workforce compensation and managing broader store-level financial performance.",

This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM experienced a $4.9 billion increase in collections and recoveries on finance receivables, which directly supported GM Financial\u2019s liquidity by providing a key source of cash inflow. This inflow was critical for GM Financial to fund new finance receivables and leased vehicles, repay debt, and maintain operational stability. By 2023, GM Financial had expanded its commercial finance receivables to $13.3 billion from $10.6 billion, indicating a strategic growth in dealer financing. This growth suggests that the prior year\u2019s strong collections helped GM Financial strengthen its liquidity base, enabling it to scale up its financing operations in 2023. The evolution of this relationship shows a positive feedback loop where improved collections in 2022 supported liquidity, which in turn enabled GM Financial to increase its financing activities in 2023.",

Risk Factors, banks will no longer be persuaded or compelled to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. GM Financial established a LIBOR transition initiative in 2019 to evaluate the potential impacts of the transition, and continues to implement strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the LIBOR discontinuation such as including fallback language into any new LIBOR based contracts. GM Financial has only a limited amount of debt outstanding that  is  scheduled  to  mature  after  June  30,  2023  and  would  utilize  the Alternative  Reference  Rates  Committee  fallback  process. Furthermore, GM Financial has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's Fallbacks Protocol and plans to transition its existing LIBOR-based derivative exposure in advance of the June 30, 2023 date when applicable LIBOR will no longer be published. For any residual exposure after the end of 2021, GM Financial expects to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions to transition such exposure.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the  use  of  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods  presented.  We  believe  the  accounting  estimates  employed  are  appropriate  and  the  resulting  balances  are  reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments  to  these  balances  in  future  periods.  Refer  to  Note  2  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  our  significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.\n\nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.",

      "question": "How did the changes in GM Financial's loan loss provisioning methodology between 2022 and 2024 impact the recognition and performance of Finance Charge Income in GM's consolidated financial statements?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial used static pool modeling techniques supplemented by management judgment to determine the allowance for loan losses, incorporating forecasts of economic conditions such as unemployment rates and GDP growth. By 2024, the recognition of Finance Charge Income was tied more explicitly to the effective interest method, with accruals suspended for delinquent accounts, and fees and commissions amortized over the loan term. The evolution in provisioning methodology reflects a more structured and forecast-driven approach, which likely led to a more stable and predictable recognition of Finance Charge Income, aligning with improved risk management practices over time.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of the transaction price.\n\nTypically,  transfers  to  daily  rental  companies  are  accounted  for  as  sales,  with  revenue  recognized  at  the  time  of  transfer.  We  defer  revenue  for  remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a liability for amounts ex pected to be paid once the remarketing services are complete at the time of sale and recognize deferred revenue in earnings upon completion of the remarketing service.\n\nUsed Vehicles Proceeds from the auction of vehicles utilized by our employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nServices and Other Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-sale services such as maintenance, OnStar, Super Cruise, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service arrangements that are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and recognized as deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services sold separately as services are performed, typically over a period of up to eight years.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial Finance  charge  income  earned  on  finance  receivables  is  recognized  using  the  effective  interest  method.  Fees  and commissions received (including manufacturer subvention) and direct costs of originating loans are deferred and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 60 days delinquent, accounts in bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has received payments bringing the delinquency to less than 60 days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 90 days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest.  Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received payments bringing the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including amounts previously charged off).\n\nIncome from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. G ains or losses realized upon disposition of off-lease assets including any payments received from lessees upon lease termination, are included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nAdvertising and Promotion E xpenditures Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $3.3 billion, $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nResearch and Development E xpenditures Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other cost of sales, were $9.2 billion, $9.9 billion and $9.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. These ex penditures include cost sharing payments and fees we receive when we enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design and development activities and use of intellectual property.\n\nCash  E quivalents  and  Restricted  Cash Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of 90 days or less.  Certain operating agreements require us to post cash as collateral. Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral. Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.",

      "question": "How did GM's financial support commitments to Cruise in 2023 influence the restructuring charges disclosed in 2024, particularly in relation to the Cruise Origin delay and robotaxi development discontinuation?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM provided Cruise with up to $3.4 billion in a multi-year credit agreement and $0.8 billion in invoice deferral capacity, with Cruise having already borrowed $0.3 billion and deferred $0.5 billion by year-end. These financial commitments enabled Cruise to continue operations despite mounting losses. However, in 2024, GM recorded $522 million in net charges related to its decision to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development, including $173 million in non-cash restructuring charges. This marked a significant shift in strategy, as GM had previously recorded $631 million in non-cash charges in mid-2024 when Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin. The restructuring charges in 2024 reflect the winding down of Cruise\u2019s independent AV operations, which had been temporarily sustained by GM\u2019s earlier financial support.",

In 2024, Tesla disclosed that the allowance for expected credit losses on its MyPower customer notes receivable decreased from $36 million to $33 million, indicating an improvement in the expected collectability of these loans. The relationship between the allowance for loan losses and expected credit losses is that the former is established to cover the latter over the life of the receivables.

          "chunk_text": "The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\n\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded ex pected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, government rebates receivable was $315 million and $378 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and an immaterial amount and $207 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Financing Receivables\n\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. Interest income on financing receivables is recognized over the loan term as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant's ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\n\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we define 'past due' as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022.\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $248 million and $266 million, respectively, of which $4 million and $5 million were due in the nex t 12 months as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for expected credit losses was $33 million and $36 million, respectively.",

      "question": "How did the change in GM Financial's leased vehicle income from $7,811 million in 2022 to $7,266 million in 2024 reflect the evolving role of GM Financial in GM's broader revenue strategy, particularly in light of GM's reliance on this subsidiary for customer financing and leasing?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial contributed $7,811 million in leased vehicle income, a key component of its financial services that GM depends on to support vehicle sales and dealer financing. By 2024, this figure decreased to $7,266 million, indicating a reduction in leasing activity or possibly a strategic shift in how GM structures customer financing. This decline in leased vehicle income from GM Financial suggests a potential contraction or repositioning of GM's financing arm, which could signal a broader shift in GM's revenue strategy, possibly reflecting changes in consumer demand for leasing, tighter credit conditions, or a pivot toward alternative financing models.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM Financial estimated the residual value of its leased vehicles at $22.7 billion, with the potential for increased depreciation or impairment charges if used vehicle prices weakened. By 2024, the estimated residual value of leased vehicles rose to $23.5 billion, indicating a slight improvement in expectations for used vehicle pricing. However, despite this increase, GM Financial still recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its investment in SAIC-GMAC, which was partly driven by weaker-than-expected market conditions and residual value performance in China. This shows that while residual value estimates increased year-over-year, continued economic and market pressures led to material impairment charges, reflecting the ongoing risk exposure tied to used vehicle prices.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM(2023) \u2192 Used Vehicle Prices: GM Financial disclosed that used vehicle prices directly affect the residual value estimates of leased vehicles, with a $22.7B estimated residual value at the end of 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Used Vehicle Prices \u2192 GM Financial: GM Financial's residual value estimates are dependent on used vehicle market conditions, and a 1% change in residual values could increase or decrease depreciation expense over the lease term.",
        "Hop 3: GM Financial \u2190 GM(2024): GM Financial recorded a $0.3B impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment in 2024, reflecting the impact of weaker-than-expected used vehicle prices and residual performance in China."

However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its ex pected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1)  the  sum  of  remaining  lease  payments  plus  estimated  residual  value;  over  (2)  leased  vehicles,  net  less  deferred  revenue. Alternatively,  if  used  vehicle  prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  effect  of  a  1%  relative  change  in  the  estimated  residual  values  at  December  31,  2024,  which  could  increase  or  decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

This growth in financing exposure through GM Financial likely contributed to a higher risk of loan defaults, prompting GM Financial to recognize a provision for loan losses in 2024 as part of its financial reporting. In 2024, GM Financial explicitly disclosed that it records a provision for loan losses to account for expected losses over the remaining life of finance receivables, indicating a direct link between the prior year's expansion in financing activities and the current year's risk provisioning.",

      "answer": "In 2023, LOW's Hardlines segment contributed $26,993M, or 27.8%, to Total Sales of $86,377M. By 2024, Hardlines' contribution decreased to $24,256M, or 29.0%, despite a drop in Total Sales to $83,674M. This indicates a decline in absolute revenue for the Hardlines segment, even though its proportional share of total sales slightly increased. The drop in Hardlines' dollar contribution suggests a potential shift in LOW's strategic focus or market demand, as other segments like Home D\u00e9cor and Building Products maintained or grew their shares. This evolution in the relationship between Total Sales and Hardlines highlights a strategic repositioning or external market pressures affecting segment performance.",

By fiscal 2023, Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes decreased by 2%, driven by lower operating overhead but higher demand creation expenses, including increased advertising and digital marketing. This shift is reflected in the 2023 financial table showing $102 million in 'Other' revenues under Global Brand Divisions, likely tied to licensing activities, suggesting a more focused strategic alignment between licensing and centralized demand creation efforts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 NIKE Brand Licensing: NIKE Brand Licensing was explicitly included in Global Brand Divisions' revenue base in fiscal 2022.",
        "Hop 2: NIKE Brand Licensing \u2192 Global Brand Divisions: Licensing revenues are part of centralized demand creation and overhead costs managed at the global brand level.",
        "Hop 3: Global Brand Divisions \u2190 NKE(2023): In fiscal 2023, Global Brand Divisions reported $102 million in 'Other' revenues, reflecting ongoing licensing contributions amid reduced operating losses and increased marketing spend."

These receivables are a key asset for GM Financial and directly influence its interest income. By 2024, GM Financial was negatively impacted by broader market challenges, including increased interest rate sensitivity due to a liability-sensitive position, where more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within twelve months. This sensitivity likely reduced net interest income during rising rate environments, weakening the financial health of GM Financial. As a result, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to fair value in 2024, reflecting the deteriorating performance of its financial assets, including retail receivables, under changing interest rate conditions.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\n\n",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated.

      "question": "How did the changes in GM's Allowance for Loan Losses in 2022 relate to the impairment charges recorded by GM Financial in 2024, and what does this indicate about the evolution of GM Financial's credit risk exposure over this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported an Allowance for Loan Losses of $1.886 billion for GM Financial receivables, reflecting management's estimate of expected credit losses based on economic forecasts and recovery rates. By 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its SAIC-GMAC investment, indicating a material deterioration in credit quality and fair value. This suggests that despite initial provisioning in 2022, the actual credit losses and economic conditions in 2024 exceeded earlier expectations, leading to realized impairments. The evolution from estimated allowances to actual impairments highlights an increase in GM Financial's credit risk exposure over the two-year period.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach).

      "answer": "In 2023, GM projected contributions of up to $700 million to its non-U.S. pension plans in 2024, likely aiming to address underfunded obligations. However, despite this contribution, the projected benefit obligation (PBO) for non-U.S. pension plans increased significantly from $499 million in 2023 to $4,396 million by the end of 2024. This suggests that the growth in liabilities outpaced the contributions made, potentially due to actuarial losses, demographic changes, or revised assumptions in the pension model. The fair value of plan assets for non-U.S. plans rose from $75 million in 2023 to $338 million in 2024, indicating some improvement in asset coverage, but still leaving a large funding gap relative to the PBO.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GMNA contributed $128.378 billion to GM's total net sales and revenue of $156.735 billion. By 2023, GMNA's contribution increased to $141.445 billion, driven by a $8.5 billion favorable variance from volume, $0.7 billion from mix, and $3.2 billion from pricing. This led to a total increase of $13.067 billion (10.2%) for GMNA, which was a significant contributor to GM's overall net sales and revenue growth of $15.108 billion (9.6%) to $171.842 billion in 2023. The growth pattern indicates that GM's overall revenue performance was largely influenced by the strong performance and strategic adjustments within the GMNA segment.",

      "question": "How did the increase in GM's Net Sales and Revenue from 2022 to 2023 influence the performance of the GMNA segment, particularly in terms of revenue growth and fleet sales expansion?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported total consolidated net sales and revenue of $156.7 billion, with GMNA contributing $128.4 billion. By 2023, total net sales and revenue rose to $171.8 billion, with GMNA increasing to $141.4 billion \u2014 a $13.1 billion (10.2%) growth. This increase was driven by volume improvements ($8.5 billion), price increases ($3.2 billion), and favorable mix ($0.7 billion). Concurrently, GMNA fleet sales rose from 990,000 units in 2022 to 1,185,000 units in 2023, representing a rise in fleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales from 16.7% to 19.2%. This shows that the overall revenue growth was closely tied to both higher volume in GMNA operations and a stronger fleet sales component.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM disclosed that GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within twelve months, which would reduce net interest income during rising interest rates but increase it during falling rates. GM Financial employed hedging strategies to manage this risk. By 2023, GM's dealer financing under GM Financial grew from $10.6 billion in 2022 to $13.3 billion, suggesting a strategic expansion despite interest rate exposure. This growth indicates that GM Financial likely adjusted its hedging strategies, as disclosed in 2022, to accommodate increased dealer financing while managing liability sensitivity.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM's Automotive Segment reported net sales and revenue of $157.667 billion, while in 2024, the segment's net sales and revenue increased to $171.842 billion. This represents a growth of approximately $14.175 billion, or about 9%. The increase suggests either improved performance within the segment, such as higher vehicle sales or pricing power, or structural changes such as acquisitions or reclassification of business units. The data from the financial statements also shows that the U.S. portion of Automotive net sales rose from $127.472 billion in 2023 to $140.536 billion in 2024, indicating strong domestic growth contributing to the overall segment performance.",

      "question": "How did the negative volume variance impact GMI's revenue in 2023, and how did this compare to the change in GMI's fleet sales volume from 2023 to 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GMI experienced a negative volume variance of $0.6 billion, which reduced its revenue compared to the prior year. This was partially offset by a favorable price variance of $1.2 billion, resulting in an overall revenue increase of $529 million for GMI in 2023. By 2024, GMI's total fleet sales dropped further from 506 thousand units in 2023 to 401 thousand units, a decrease of 105 thousand units or 20.7%. This continued decline in fleet sales volume suggests that the negative volume variance observed in 2023 not only persisted but translated into a significant unit volume reduction in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM's EBIT-adjusted was positively impacted by $6.2 billion due to Price, contributing significantly to their $10.3 billion total EBIT-adjusted. By 2024, the 'Price' impact on EBIT-adjusted had declined to just $0.7 billion, despite a substantial increase in total EBIT-adjusted to $14.5 billion. This suggests GM maintained strong margin growth even with reduced pricing power, likely through cost discipline and volume growth ($12.8 billion favorable impact from volume in 2024). The evolution shows a strategic shift from relying on pricing to leveraging scale and operational efficiency.",

      "question": "How did GM's investment in Cruise in 2022 influence the financial risks faced by GM Financial in 2024, particularly in light of the impairment charges recorded during that period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM invested $1.0 billion in Cruise through the issuance of Class G Preferred Shares, signaling strategic alignment and financial commitment to autonomous vehicle development. Cruise also had a multi-year $5.2 billion credit agreement with GM Financial to fund AV purchases from GM, indicating a dependency relationship. By 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment, reflecting broader financial stress and risk exposure. This suggests that GM's earlier capital allocation to Cruise, and the intercompany financing arrangement, increased GM Financial's exposure to strategic and operational risks, culminating in measurable financial impacts by 2024.",

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\n\nGMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "In 2022, AWS sales growth of 37% was primarily attributed to increased customer usage, despite offsetting pricing changes driven by customer price reductions. By 2024, AWS sales growth had slowed to 19%, and while increased customer usage still remained the primary driver, the impact was proportionally less compared to earlier years. The shift from 37% growth in 2022 to 19% in 2024 indicates a deceleration in the rate of customer usage expansion or a greater influence of pricing changes, particularly those tied to long-term contracts. This shows that while customer usage continued to positively impact AWS sales, its relative contribution to growth diminished over time.",

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. NIKE Direct revenues decreased 12% due to digital sales declines of 15% and comparable store sales declines of 14%, in part due to reduced physical retail traffic as a result of government restrictions due to COVID-19 as well as ongoing marketplace dynamics, partially offset by the addition of new stores.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues decreased 10%, driven primarily by lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 7%, while lower ASP per pair reduced footwear revenues by approximately 3 percentage points, driven by lower NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues decreased 21%, due primarily to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel decreased 15%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 6 percentage points, primarily due to lower NIKE Direct and fullprice ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nReported EBIT decreased 27% due to lower revenues, gross margin contraction and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased approximately 390 basis points, reflecting impacts from COVID-19 related government restrictions which reduced physical retail traffic and led to higher inventory obsolescence reserves recognized primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin was also largely due to higher product costs and lower NIKE Direct margins. This activity was partially offset by favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Growth in demand creation expense was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense. Operating overhead expense increased largely due to higher wage-related costs and higher strategic technology investments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the NIKE Brand was a core segment of Nike's business, focused on performance and lifestyle products. By 2024, Nike implemented strategic pricing actions that increased the NIKE Brand's full-price ASP (net of discounts), contributing to a 110 basis point increase in gross margin to 44.6%. This was partially driven by lower product costs (on a wholesale equivalent basis), which increased gross margin by approximately 10 basis points, due to lower ocean freight and logistics costs. To manage cost volatility, Nike actively hedged foreign currency exposures related to product costs in 2024, aiming to stabilize the financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations. This reflects a shift from 2022, where economic sanctions in Russia led to a one-time $96 million charge, highlighting increased strategic focus on cost and currency risk management by 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nNIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across Men's, Women's and Kids', amplified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, were reported within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment. Refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures for information regarding the divestiture of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley. Converse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nEconomic sanctions imposed on Russia during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, impacted the Company's local business and a reduction in the Ruble liquidity affected the Company's ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. As a result, the Company deconsolidated its Russian legal entities, which resulted in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $96 million recognized within Other (income) expense, net, classified within Corporate. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, the Company made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 62",

      "answer": "Starbucks' Channel Development segment maintained a consistent $34.7 million goodwill balance from 2022 to 2023, indicating no significant changes in the valuation or strategic importance of this segment during the period.

      "answer": "In 2022, the Global Brand Divisions represented a centralized cost center primarily responsible for demand creation, product design, and administrative overhead, with a loss before interest and taxes that was partially driven by high operating overhead expenses. By 2023, the loss before interest and taxes decreased by 2%, largely due to a reduction in operating overhead expenses, including lower wage-related costs, technology spend, and other administrative costs. This improvement was partially offset by increased demand creation expenses, particularly in advertising and digital marketing. The shift reflects a strategic focus on cost containment in administrative areas while increasing investment in brand visibility and demand generation. This dual approach allowed for a modest improvement in the Global Brand Divisions' financial performance trajectory year-over-year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, General Motors invested $1.0 billion in Cruise, signaling a strong commitment to autonomous vehicle development. By 2024, Cruise contributed $102 million to GM's net sales and revenue, which was relatively modest compared to GM's total revenue of $187.4 billion. However, Cruise's adjusted loss before interest and taxes stood at $1.89 billion in 2022, indicating that despite progress in autonomous vehicle testing and commercialization, the segment was not yet profitable. This suggests that while GM's investment in Cruise was a strategic move to position itself in the future of mobility, the financial returns had not yet materialized by 2024, and the autonomous segment was still in a growth and development phase rather than a profit-generating one.",

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\n\nGMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory.

By 2023, this figure had decreased to 6.30% for U.S. pension benefits, reflecting a downward adjustment in the company's assumptions about future pension fund performance. This change indicates a more conservative outlook for asset returns in the medium term.",

      "question": "How did the decline in leased vehicle income from GM Financial between 2022 ($9,530M) and 2024 ($7,811M) influence GM's shift in automotive financing strategy, particularly in light of GM's increased focus on direct vehicle sales revenue growth from $108,669M in 2022 to $143,974M in 2024?",
      "answer": "The decline in leased vehicle income from GM Financial, from $9,530M in 2022 to $7,811M in 2024, suggests a weakening in leasing activity or a strategic reduction in lease offerings. This decline coincided with GM's increased emphasis on direct vehicle sales, as evidenced by the $143,974M in automotive net sales and revenue in 2024, up from $108,669M in 2022. This shift likely reflects a strategic pivot toward prioritizing upfront sales over financing and leasing, possibly to stabilize cash flows and reduce exposure to residual value risks in a volatile used car market. GM's reliance on GM Financial to support vehicle sales appears to have evolved, with a greater focus on facilitating purchases rather than leases, aligning with broader market trends and internal risk management priorities.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon reported that North America sales grew by 18%, with increased unit sales \u2014 including those by third-party sellers \u2014 being a key driver. The company also noted that as third-party seller sales grew, the cost of the A-to-z Guarantee program would increase. In 2023, Amazon explicitly stated that 'as our third-party seller sales grow, the cost of this program will increase and could negatively affect our operating results,' confirming the earlier expectation and showing a direct link between the prior year's sales growth and the subsequent financial impact from third-party seller liabilities.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SBUX reported Store Operating Expenses at 38.9% of total net revenues. In 2023, this percentage increased by 140 basis points (to 40.3%), primarily due to investments in store partner wages and benefits (170 basis points), deleverage (80 basis points), and increased promotional activity (70 basis points). However, this increase was partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies, which contributed approximately 170 basis points of relief in 2023. These efficiencies, while significant, were not enough to prevent a 220 basis point contraction in international operating margin, which fell to 14.2% in 2023 compared to 2022. The in-store efficiencies positively impacted the margin by approximately 100 basis points, but were overwhelmed by the cost pressures from wages, deleverage, and promotions.",

      "question": "How did GM's reliance on GM Financial's commercial finance receivables evolve from 2022 to 2023, particularly in light of GM Financial's allowance for loan losses methodology and the observed decline in GM's reported commercial finance receivables from $187M to $164M?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied on GM Financial to provide commercial financing to dealers, with the allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables based on historical loss experience and forecasted industry vehicle sales. GM Financial acknowledged uncertainty in these estimates, noting that actual losses could exceed projections. By 2023, GM reported a decline in commercial finance receivables from $187M to $164M, indicating a reduction in outstanding dealer financing. This decline may reflect tighter credit conditions, reduced dealer lending activity, or more conservative risk management by GM Financial in response to economic forecasts. The evolution suggests a recalibration of GM\u2019s financial services strategy to align with changing market dynamics and risk exposure.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported $18.7B in Prime FICO score 680+ retail finance receivables, representing 64% of their total $51.3B in receivables. By 2024, this segment grew to $24.2B, increasing its share to 76.3% of total retail finance receivables, which reached $76.1B. This indicates a stronger emphasis on prime credit quality receivables over time, with the Prime segment growing by 29.6% while total receivables increased by 48.5%.

      "question": "How did Tesla's management of expected credit losses in 2023 influence the changes in its allowance for loan losses in 2024, particularly with respect to the MyPower customer notes receivable?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Tesla disclosed that it considers expected credit losses when determining the allowance for loan losses, factoring in historical credit loss levels, economic trends, and forecasts. For the MyPower customer notes, Tesla maintained an allowance of $36 million as of December 31, 2023. By 2024, Tesla continued this methodology but reported a decrease in the allowance for expected credit losses related to MyPower notes to $33 million, down from $36 million in 2023, alongside a decline in the total outstanding balance from $266 million to $248 million. This indicates that Tesla's credit risk exposure for these legacy loans decreased year-over-year, likely due to improved collection performance or a reduction in outstanding balances, which directly influenced the lower provision for loan losses in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TSLA(2023) \u2192 Expected Credit Losses: Tesla disclosed its methodology for determining expected credit losses, including for financing receivables like MyPower notes, with an allowance of $36 million as of year-end 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Expected Credit Losses \u2192 Allowance for Loan Losses: Expected credit losses directly inform the allowance for loan losses, as stated in the JPMorgan evidence, where the allowance reflects the expected lifetime losses of the loan portfolio.",
        "Hop 3: Allowance for Loan Losses \u2190 TSLA(2024): Tesla's 2024 filing showed a reduction in the allowance for expected credit losses on MyPower notes to $33 million, reflecting a lower risk profile compared to 2023."

          "chunk_text": "The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.\n\nWe regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the decline, (ii) any currently recorded ex pected credit losses and (iii) the creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of our investments approximates its fair value.\n\n## Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\n\nAccounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and government rebates already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.\n\nDepending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, government rebates receivable was $315 million and $378 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and an immaterial amount and $207 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Financing Receivables\n\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. Interest income on financing receivables is recognized over the loan term as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant's ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\n\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we define 'past due' as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022.\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $248 million and $266 million, respectively, of which $4 million and $5 million were due in the nex t 12 months as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for expected credit losses was $33 million and $36 million, respectively.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported $7,935 million in retail finance receivables from borrowers with FICO scores in the near-prime range (620 to 679), representing 15.4% of the total portfolio. This segment increased from earlier years, indicating a growing presence of near-prime borrowers. By 2023, GM Financial continued to segment its retail finance receivables by FICO score, with specific attention to credit risk management, as evidenced by the allowance for loan losses remaining stable at 2.7% of finance receivables. The persistence of FICO-based segmentation in 2023 suggests GM maintained a structured approach to credit risk, even as the near-prime segment grew, potentially signaling either improved underwriting or a strategic shift toward capturing more near-prime borrowers without increasing loss provisions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, NKE increased its demand creation expense by 6%, largely due to higher digital marketing costs. By 2024, the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes decreased by only 2%, from an estimated $1.2 billion in 2023 to approximately $1.176 billion in 2024. This minimal $24 million absolute improvement in losses came at the cost of a significant increase in digital marketing spend, suggesting a low return on investment and declining efficiency in how digital marketing spend translated into financial performance improvements for the Global Brand Divisions.",

      "answer": "The goodwill balance for the Channel Development segment remained unchanged at $34.7 million from fiscal 2023 to fiscal 2024, indicating that Starbucks did not make any significant acquisitions or divestitures in this segment during this time. This stability suggests that the company likely maintained a consistent strategic focus and long-term valuation expectations for its licensed stores and CPG business, without major disruptions or strategic pivots that would impact goodwill. The lack of change in goodwill implies a stable outlook and confidence in the performance and future cash flow projections of this segment.",

      "question": "How did the impact of Average Selling Price on GM's Total Net Sales and Revenue change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's pricing power and revenue dynamics during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM reported that favorable price changes contributed $0.7 billion to Total Net Sales and Revenue. However, by 2024, the company experienced a $2,059 million decrease in Total Net Sales and Revenue, with only a $0.2 billion positive contribution from price changes. This indicates a significant weakening in GM's pricing power, where the positive impact of Average Selling Price on revenue not only diminished but occurred alongside an overall decline in total revenue. The shift suggests that GM faced stronger market pressures or strategic pricing adjustments that reduced its ability to leverage higher prices to boost revenue.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied heavily on GM Financial to support vehicle sales through leasing and financing, and GM Financial faced risks tied to used vehicle prices, including residual value performance and wholesale auction values. By 2024, GM Financial had an estimated $23.5 billion in residual value exposure, with a 1% change in residual values potentially affecting depreciation expense by millions. This growing exposure in 2024 increased GM's operational sensitivity to used vehicle price fluctuations, as noted in GM's 2024 risk disclosures, where volatility in used vehicle availability and pricing was cited as a key factor that could depress new vehicle demand and adversely affect profitability. The chain shows that GM's financial arm became more exposed to used vehicle markets over time, amplifying the parent company's vulnerability to those dynamics.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its ex pected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1)  the  sum  of  remaining  lease  payments  plus  estimated  residual  value;  over  (2)  leased  vehicles,  net  less  deferred  revenue. Alternatively,  if  used  vehicle  prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  effect  of  a  1%  relative  change  in  the  estimated  residual  values  at  December  31,  2024,  which  could  increase  or  decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks related to our operations\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability  of  affordable  financing,  elevated  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or uncertainty, the occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons, including a moderate to severe recession in any of the markets in which we operate, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials, energy or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, elevated cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials for our EV  propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EV s and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. G eopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic, regulatory and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials, energy and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of  the  largest  global  manufacturers  and  numerous  domestic  manufacturers,  which  have  ex perienced  significant  growth  in  customer  acceptance,  as  well  as  nontraditional  market  participants,  such  as  domestic  technology  companies.  Over  the  last  several  years,  this  intense  competition  and  an  increasingly  challenging operating environment negatively impacted the profitability of our operations in China, our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. As a result, in December 2024, our Board of Directors determined there to be a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JV s. Updated business forecasts and recent restructuring actions to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions have indicated that the loss in value is other-than-temporary for our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), certain SGM subsidiaries and SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC). As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024. We also recorded additional equity losses of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of these restructuring actions, which includes plant closures and portfolio optimization, in the year ended December 31, 2024. These charges are non-cash in nature. We expect SGM will likely incur additional restructuring charges in 2025. We cannot guarantee that the restructuring actions will be successful in our China JV s achieving long-term profitability or that additional, material restructuring actions will not be required.\n\nIn addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EV s, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies while achieving affordability. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China and the unique regulatory landscape in China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions, weakening economic conditions in China or China's level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale.

      "answer": "The GMI segment's favorable price variance of $1.2 billion in 2023 indicates that General Motors successfully implemented pricing actions that positively impacted revenue despite minimal overall growth\u2014from $15.4 billion in 2022 to $15.9 billion in 2023. This suggests that the company's pricing strategy was effective in capturing value, even though unit volume or mix did not significantly contribute to growth. The $0.5 billion increase in GMI revenue was entirely driven by price, as volume had a negative impact of $0.6 billion, showing a strategic focus on pricing power over volume expansion.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, SBUX's Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $1.8 billion, which increased to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2024 \u2014 a $100 million rise. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($93 million), partner wages and benefits ($57 million), and proxy solicitation costs ($28 million), partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($61 million). The Corporate and Other segment's operating loss of $1,918.1 million in 2024 contributed directly to the overall operating income of $5,408.8 million, down from $5,870.8 million in 2023. Thus, the widening loss in this segment placed downward pressure on total operating income despite performance in core business units.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial renewed $25.8 billion in revolving credit facilities and issued $23.3 billion in securitization notes with a weighted average interest rate of 0.79%, while also issuing $12.2 billion in senior notes at 1.62%. By 2023, GM Financial renewed $20.8 billion in credit facilities and issued $23.6 billion in securitization notes at a significantly higher interest rate of 5.60%, along with $11.4 billion in senior notes at 5.70%. This indicates a shift to more expensive borrowing in 2023, likely reflecting tighter credit conditions or increased risk perception, which could impact GM's ability to finance vehicle sales and dealer support through GM Financial.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Most of the secured debt was issued by VIEs and is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged assets. Refer to Note 11 for additional information on GM Financial's involvement with VIEs. GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. The weighted-average interest rate on secured debt was 1.27% at December 31, 2021. The revolving credit facilities have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2027 and securitization notes payable have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2034. At the end of the revolving period, if not renewed, the debt of revolving credit facilities  will  amortize  over  a  defined  period.  In  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  GM  Financial  renewed  revolving  credit facilities with total borrowing capacity of $25.8 billion and issued $23.3 billion in aggregate principal amount of securitization notes payable with an initial weighted average interest rate of 0.79% and maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2034.\n\nUnsecured debt consists of senior notes, credit facilities and other unsecured debt. Senior notes outstanding at December 31, 2021 have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2031 and have a weighted-average interest rate of 2.77%. In the year ended December 31, 2021, GM Financial issued $12.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior notes with an initial weighted average interest rate of 1.62% and maturity dates ranging from 2024 to 2031.\n\nIn September 2021, GM Financial redeemed $1.5 billion in aggregate principal amount of 5.2% senior notes due in 2023. The redemption  resulted  in  a  $105  million  loss  on  the  early  extinguishment  of  debt.  The  loss  is  included  in  GM  Financial  interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nIn January 2022, GM Financial issued $2.6 billion in senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 2.57% and maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2032.\n\nUnsecured credit facilities and other unsecured debt have original maturities of up to four years. The weighted-average interest rate on these credit facilities and other unsecured debt was 2.69% at December 31, 2021.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the change in GM's Eliminations/reclassifications from a reduction of $105 million in 2022 to a significantly larger reduction of $296 million in 2024 impact the growth trajectory of Total Net Sales and Revenue, which increased from $127 billion in 2022 to $187.4 billion in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported Eliminations/reclassifications at $105 million, which slightly reduced Total Net Sales and Revenue of $127.0 billion. By 2024, the Eliminations/reclassifications had increased to $296 million, a substantial $191 million increase from 2022, and a $145 million increase from 2023. Despite this larger reduction, GM's Total Net Sales and Revenue grew significantly to $187.4 billion in 2024, up $15.6 billion from 2023 and $60.4 billion from 2022. This indicates that the underlying business growth was strong enough to offset the increased eliminations, suggesting robust performance in core segments like GMNA, which saw a $16.1 billion favorable variance in 2024.",

        "Hop 1: GM(2022) \u2192 Eliminations: GM reported Eliminations/reclassifications at $105 million in 2022, reducing Total Net Sales and Revenue.",

      "question": "How did GM's increased exposure to residual value risk through GM Financial in 2024, compared to 2023, affect the depreciation expense sensitivity and segment-level residual value performance for leased vehicles?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM Financial reported commercial finance receivables of $13.3 billion, indicating a growing portfolio of leased vehicles that GM was financing. By 2024, GM Financial disclosed that the estimated residual value of its leased vehicles had risen to $23.5 billion, with crossovers alone accounting for $13.184 billion of that total. However, GM Financial also noted that a 1% change in residual value estimates could significantly impact depreciation expense over the lease term. This increased exposure, compared to 2023 residual values totaling $22.661 billion, suggests that GM's financial arm became more vulnerable to market fluctuations in used vehicle pricing. As a result, GM would have had to closely monitor depreciation sensitivity and residual performance, especially as cars saw a notable drop in residual value from $734 million in 2023 to $590 million in 2024, despite a relatively stable overall portfolio size.",

However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its ex pected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1)  the  sum  of  remaining  lease  payments  plus  estimated  residual  value;  over  (2)  leased  vehicles,  net  less  deferred  revenue. Alternatively,  if  used  vehicle  prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  effect  of  a  1%  relative  change  in  the  estimated  residual  values  at  December  31,  2024,  which  could  increase  or  decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

By 2024, GMI's fleet sales had increased to 401 thousand out of a total of 1,016 thousand, accounting for 39.5% of the total. While GMI maintained a strong presence in GM's fleet sales throughout this period, its proportional contribution slightly decreased.

      "question": "How did GM's financial support for Cruise's autonomous vehicle development in 2023, including credit and deferral agreements, relate to the restructuring charges GM recorded in 2024 after pausing and delaying Cruise's AV operations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM provided Cruise with access to up to $3.4 billion in credit through 2024 for AV purchases and had a deferral agreement allowing Cruise to defer up to $0.8 billion in engineering and capital costs, with $0.3 billion and $0.5 billion drawn respectively by year-end. Despite this support, Cruise paused its AV operations in October 2023, leading to $529 million in restructuring charges. In 2024, GM recorded additional charges of $631 million when Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin and $522 million when GM decided to stop funding Cruise\u2019s robotaxi development, signaling a strategic pivot and reduced financial backing.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, NIKE's Global Brand Divisions experienced a 17% increase in their loss before interest and taxes, driven in part by higher wage-related expenses as part of increased operating overhead and demand creation spending. This rise contributed to a larger corporate loss. However, in fiscal 2023, wage-related expenses decreased favorably by $80 million, contributing to an overall $221 million reduction in the Corporate segment's loss before interest and taxes. This shows a clear reversal in the trend from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, where cost management efforts in wage-related spending positively impacted the corporate financial performance.",

      "question": "How did the contribution of GM's GMI segment to total fleet sales change between 2022 and 2024, and what does this reveal about the segment's evolving role in GM's revenue strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GMI contributed 426 thousand units to GM's total fleet sales of 990 thousand units, representing 43% of the total. By 2024, GMI's contribution dropped to 401 thousand units out of a total fleet sales of 1,016 thousand units, representing 39.5% of the total. This decline in GMI's share of fleet sales coincides with a broader shift in GM's strategic focus, as seen in the 2024 10-K filing, where the GMI segment's net sales and revenue stood at $15,420 million in 2022, compared to GM's total consolidated net sales and revenue of $127,004 million. While GMI remains a significant contributor to GM's revenue, its relative importance to fleet sales has decreased, suggesting a potential realignment of GM's segment priorities.",

        "Hop 1: GM(2022) \u2192 Net Sales and Revenue: GM reported total consolidated net sales and revenue of $127,004 million in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Net Sales and Revenue \u2192 GMI: In 2022, the GMI segment reported net sales and revenue of $15,420 million, contributing significantly to GM's total revenue.",
        "Hop 3: GMI \u2190 GM(2024): By 2024, GMI's fleet sales contribution had decreased to 401 thousand units, representing a drop in its relative importance to GM's overall fleet sales."

      "question": "How did the composition and financial contribution of Miscellaneous Revenues within the Global Brand Divisions change from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024, and what does this reveal about Nike's evolving strategy around centralized revenue streams?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Miscellaneous Revenues were explicitly included within the Global Brand Divisions and amounted to $102 million, primarily from NIKE Brand licensing and other non-geographic segment revenues. These revenues were part of a broader structure that also included demand creation and centrally managed operating overhead, such as digital operations and product design. By fiscal 2024, the Global Brand Divisions continued to operate as a distinct segment, but the 'Other' category\u2014where Miscellaneous Revenues were likely reclassified\u2014remained small at $102 million, showing no growth over two years. This contrasts with the significant increases in core footwear and apparel revenues across geographic segments during the same period. The lack of growth in this segment suggests that Nike may have deprioritized or maintained a stable focus on licensing and miscellaneous revenue streams, instead concentrating on scaling its core product and regional businesses.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM reported $1,857 million in finance receivables more than 30 days delinquent, which directly influenced GM Financial's credit loss provisions as the subsidiary used static pool modeling techniques incorporating economic forecasts like unemployment rates and GDP growth to determine its allowance for loan losses. By 2024, GM Financial had recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment, indicating that the earlier delinquency trends, combined with broader market challenges in China, likely contributed to a deterioration in asset quality and investment value. This shows a clear evolution where earlier credit risk in receivables translated into later impairment losses, reflecting the downstream financial impact across the entity chain.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How did the Corporate and Other Segment's impact on goodwill balances change from fiscal year 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about Starbucks' strategic allocation of intangible assets?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2022, the Corporate and Other Segment held a goodwill balance of $1.0 million, which remained unchanged at $1.0 million in the 2023 disclosures, despite broader reductions in goodwill across other segments. However, the 'Other' adjustments related to the Corporate and Other Segment decreased from a $0.1 million increase in 2022 to no change in 2023. This suggests that while the direct goodwill allocation to the Corporate and Other Segment remained stable, Starbucks' adjustments for intangible asset reallocations or impairments related to this segment became less active in 2023 compared to 2022.",

        "Hop 3: Goodwill Balance \u2190 SBUX(2023): In the 2023 disclosures, the Corporate and Other Segment's goodwill remained flat at $1.0 million, with no 'Other' adjustments, contrasting with the small $0.1 million adjustment in 2022."

      "question": "How did GM's non-vehicle revenue composition evolve between 2023 and 2024, particularly in relation to automotive revenues and the $0.3 billion SAIC-GMAC impairment charge recorded in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM disclosed that 'Other' revenue included non-vehicle related automotive revenues and equity income from nonconsolidated affiliates. By 2024, the company again listed non-vehicle related automotive revenues as part of 'Other,' but with a notable change: GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment due to deteriorating market conditions in China. This impairment suggests a decline in the value of one of GM's nonconsolidated affiliates, which would have impacted the equity income component of non-vehicle related automotive revenues. Therefore, while the structure of non-vehicle revenue remained conceptually similar across years, the 2024 results reflect a deterioration in one key component due to the impairment, signaling a negative shift in GM's non-vehicle revenue composition.",

We believe the accounting estimates employed are appropriate and the resulting balances are reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments to these balances in future periods. Refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for our significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.\n\nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are re-evaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control  over  financial  reporting  as  of  December  31,  2024,  based  on  criteria  established  in  Internal  Control-Integrated  Framework  issued  by  the  Committee  of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Product warranty and recall campaigns\n\n## Description of the matter\n\nAs discussed in Note 12 to the financial statements, the liabilities for product warranty and recall campaigns amount to $10.6 billion at December 31, 2024. The Company accrues for costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and accrues the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.\n\nAuditing these liabilities involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management's estimates due to the size, uncertainties, and potential volatility related to the estimated liabilities. Management's estimates consider historical claims experience, including the nature, frequency, and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line,  and  the  key  assumptions  of  historical  data  being  predictive  of  future  activity  and  events,  specifically  the number of historical periods used and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies.",

      "question": "How did the growth in GM's GMI segment revenue from 2022 to 2023 contribute to the overall increase in GM's total net sales and revenue, and how does this segment growth align with the broader automotive segment performance and pricing trends?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM's GMI segment reported $15.42 billion in revenue, which increased to $15.95 billion in 2023 \u2014 a $529 million (3.4%) growth. This increase was primarily driven by price improvements, which contributed $1.2 billion, partially offset by a volume decline of $600 million. During the same period, GM's total net sales and revenue grew from $156.735 billion in 2022 to $171.842 billion in 2023, a $15.108 billion (9.6%) increase. The automotive segment as a whole saw a $13.693 billion (9.5%) revenue growth, with GMI contributing $529 million of that increase. This indicates that while GMI's growth was more modest compared to the broader automotive segment, it still played a role in the overall revenue expansion, particularly through pricing strategies in international markets.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GMNA's revenue increased by $13.067 billion (10.2%) compared to 2022, with $0.7 billion attributed to 'Other Variance'. By 2024, GMNA's revenue grew by $16.064 billion (11.4%) compared to 2023, but the 'Other Variance' contribution dropped to $0 billion. This indicates that the factors driving GMNA's performance shifted from 2023 to 2024, with a greater reliance on volume growth ($12.8 billion in 2024 vs. $8.5 billion in 2023) and less on unclassified or residual factors. The absence of a positive 'Other Variance' in 2024 suggests more predictable or transparent drivers of growth in that year.",

By 2024, these figures increased to $13,575 million in the U.S. and $2,261 million in Non-U.S. regions, totaling $15,836 million. This represents a growth of $2,422 million (18.05%) in total Net Sales and Revenue from GMFinancial between 2022 and 2024. The increase indicates that GM's financial stake in GMFinancial strengthened over this period, as evidenced by the higher contribution from this segment to GM\u2019s overall revenue base, suggesting a strategic deepening of involvement with GMFinancial.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial expected used vehicle prices to decrease relative to 2021 levels but remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. By 2024, if used vehicle prices weakened compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. This expectation materialized as GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value, directly reflecting the negative impact of weaker-than-expected used vehicle prices on residual value estimates and asset valuations.",

If  a decrease  in  residual  values  is  concentrated  among  specific  asset  groups,  the  decrease  could  result  in  an  immediate  impairment charge.  GM  Financial  reviewed  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio  for  indicators  of  impairment  and  determined  that  no  impairment indicators were present at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nUsed vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, GM Financial expects used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory.\n\nPension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.",

However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its ex pected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1)  the  sum  of  remaining  lease  payments  plus  estimated  residual  value;  over  (2)  leased  vehicles,  net  less  deferred  revenue. Alternatively,  if  used  vehicle  prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  effect  of  a  1%  relative  change  in  the  estimated  residual  values  at  December  31,  2024,  which  could  increase  or  decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial generated $4.1 billion in finance charge income, a key component of its liquidity and cash flow generation. This income was critical to funding GM Financial\u2019s operations, including purchases of finance receivables, debt repayments, and interest costs. However, by 2024, due to intense competition and a challenging regulatory environment in China, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment, reflecting a significant decline in the fair value of that asset. This indicates a deterioration in the performance of GM Financial's international investments, despite earlier strong income streams from domestic operations in 2022.",

        "Hop 1: GM(2022) \u2192 Finance Charge Income: GM Financial reported $4.1 billion in finance charge income in 2022, indicating strong performance in its core financial services.",

        "Hop 3: GM Financial \u2190 GM(2024): In 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment, signaling a negative impact on its financial health."

          "chunk_text": "\nSGM is a joint venture we established with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) (50%). SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How did Starbucks' increased investment in partner wages and benefits from fiscal 2023 to 2024 relate to the rise in store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, store operating expenses were $11,959.2 million, representing 45.0% of North America Total Net Revenues, with partner wages and benefits identified as a key cost driver contributing approximately 170 basis points to the overall increase in store operating expenses. By fiscal 2024, store operating expenses rose to $12,467.1 million, or 46.2% of total net revenues, with investments in partner wages and benefits again cited as a primary factor (approximately 170 basis points of the increase). Starbucks also reported a specific $57 million incremental investment in partner wages and benefits in fiscal 2024, showing a direct link between strategic wage investments and the rising cost structure. This indicates that the company's continued focus on improving partner compensation significantly contributed to the 140 basis point increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues from 2023 to 2024.",

Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2024, or 5%, compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($93 million), investments in partner wages and benefits ($57 million), and certain proxy solicitation and advisory services costs incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 ($28 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($61 million) and the lapping of donations to The Starbucks Foundation made in fiscal 2023 ($30 million).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of September 29, 2024, approximately $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Borrowing Capacity\n\n## Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the '2021 credit facility'), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital ex penditures, and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\n\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's rating agencies. The 'Base Rate' is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\n\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of September 29, 2024, or October 1, 2023.",

Despite this increase in goodwill, the International Segment experienced negative revenue impacts in fiscal 2024, including a $69 million decline in product and equipment sales and royalty revenues from licensees, compounded by $27 million in unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts.

      "answer": "GM Financial contributed $4.103 billion in finance charge income in 2022, a key component of GM's total revenue. The growth in commercial finance receivables from $10.6 billion in 2022 to $13.3 billion in 2023 indicates an increased emphasis on dealer financing and other commercial lending activities. This expansion likely enhanced GM Financial\u2019s ability to generate higher finance charge income, suggesting a strategic shift where GM increasingly relies on its financial arm not only to support automotive sales but also to drive financial performance through expanded credit offerings to dealers and customers.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nin  active  markets,  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  instruments  in  markets  that  are  not  active  and  model-derived  valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable  Debt  Securities We  generally  classify  marketable  debt  securities  as  available-for-sale.  Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

      "question": "How did Starbucks' international store operating expense management through in-store operational efficiencies evolve from fiscal 2023 to 2024, given the 100 basis point offset in 2023 and 170 basis point offset in 2024?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Starbucks' international operating margin was positively impacted by approximately 100 basis points due to in-store operational efficiencies, which partially offset other cost pressures. By fiscal 2024, the impact of these efficiencies on store operating expenses increased to approximately 170 basis points, reflecting stronger cost management efforts. However, this was still outweighed by increased investments in store partner wages (170 basis points) and promotional activity (70 basis points). The evolution shows that while operational efficiencies improved year-over-year, they were not sufficient to fully counterbalance rising operating expenses in international markets.",

See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

By 2024, the situation reversed: an increase in discount rates resulted in actuarial gains, reducing obligations. This shift shows that GM's pension funding requirements became more sensitive to interest rate movements, with lower discount rates in earlier years amplifying liabilities and higher rates in later years providing some relief. The 2024 disclosures also emphasize that a decrease in discount rates would still increase future funding needs, highlighting the ongoing financial risk from interest rate volatility.",

Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than ex pected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions.\n\nThere are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.\n\nFactors that affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonU.S. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n\n## *  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\n## Item 1B.

Material risks from cybersecurity threats are managed across GM, GM Financial, Cruise, service providers such as data processors, third-party suppliers, dealers and vendors, and monitoring such risks and threats are integrated into the Company's overall risk management program.\n\nGM has a Cybersecurity Management Board that brings together representatives from senior management across the Company's Software &amp; Services, Product Development, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Finance, Communications, Human Resources, Legal and Public Policy organizations to provide guidance and monitor overall company cybersecurity risk. The Company's cybersecurity maturity scorecard, cybersecurity threats and incident information are reviewed by the Company's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and the Cybersecurity Management Board during standing meetings as well as in impromptu sessions, when appropriate. During the reviews, various topics are discussed, which may include:\n\n- implementation and maturity of the Company's cybersecurity program, risk management framework, including cybersecurity risk policies, procedures and governance;\n- cybersecurity and privacy risk, including potential impact to the Company's employees, customers, supply chain, joint ventures and other stakeholders;\n- intelligence briefings on notable cyber events impacting the industry; and\n- cybersecurity budget and resource allocation, including industry benchmarking and economic modeling of various potential cybersecurity events.\n\nThe Company maintains administrative, physical, technical and organizational safeguards, including employee training, incident response capability reviews and exercises, cybersecurity insurance and business continuity mechanisms for the protection of the Company's assets.

By 2024, this Equity Income was explicitly listed as a component of Automotive Segment expenses, indicating a shift in how this income was factored into segment-level performance metrics.

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "question": "How did the stability of Starbucks' goodwill allocation to the Channel Development segment from 2022 ($34.7M) to 2024 ($34.7M) reflect the company's strategic focus or lack thereof in that business area, considering the significant goodwill fluctuations observed in other segments over the same period?",
      "answer": "Starbucks maintained a consistent goodwill allocation of $34.7M to the Channel Development segment from 2022 to 2024, while other segments like International saw notable changes (from $2,756.7M in 2022 to $2,788.5M in 2024). This stability in goodwill suggests that the company did not make major strategic shifts or acquisitions within the Channel Development segment during this period. The unchanged goodwill contrasts with the $31.8M net increase in International segment goodwill, indicating a more dynamic investment focus elsewhere. The lack of change in goodwill for Channel Development implies a steady-state approach to this segment, potentially signaling either maturity in its development or a deliberate pause in expansion efforts within this operational area.",

        "Hop 1: SBUX(2022) \u2192 Goodwill Balance: Starbucks reported a goodwill balance of $34.7M allocated to the Channel Development segment in 2022.",

        "Hop 3: Channel Development Segment \u2190 SBUX(2024): In 2024, the goodwill balance for the Channel Development segment remained unchanged at $34.7M, indicating no new investment or impairment in this segment over the two-year period."

This change was partially influenced by the 'Other Variance' metric, which showed a negative variance of $0.4 billion in 2023 compared to 2022. The 'Other Variance' captures non-volume, non-mix, and non-price factors, suggesting that despite the modest revenue growth, there were underlying challenges or costs affecting the GMI segment's performance that were not directly tied to traditional sales drivers. This indicates a subtle deterioration in non-operational or external factors impacting GMI's profitability or efficiency.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the GMI segment reported a revenue of $15,949 million, contributing $1.2 billion to the price variance for the year. By 2024, GMI's revenue decreased to $13,890 million, and its contribution to price variance dropped significantly to $0.2 billion. This indicates a notable decline in the segment's pricing power or a strategic shift in pricing approach, as the price variance contribution fell by $1.0 billion (83%) year-over-year. The drop in GMI's revenue and its reduced influence on price variance suggests a weakening in market demand, competitive pressures, or a deliberate pricing strategy to maintain or grow market share.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial contributed $431 million in 'Other income' to GM's total revenue, while by 2024, this figure had increased to $732 million. This represents a 70% increase in the 'Other income' generated through GM Financial. The growth suggests a strengthening role of GM Financial in supporting GM\u2019s broader financial performance, particularly through non-core financing activities. This evolution reflects a strategic shift or operational expansion within GM Financial that enhanced its contribution to GM\u2019s diversified income sources.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the average selling price positively impacted total net sales and revenue, contributing $0.7 billion to the overall $16.064 billion increase in revenue compared to the prior year. However, by 2024, the impact of average selling price on total net sales and revenue had declined, contributing only $0.2 billion to a $2.059 billion decrease in revenue year-over-year. This indicates a weakening in pricing power or a strategic shift in how GM approached pricing in 2024 compared to 2022.",

        "Hop 1: GM(2022) \u2192 Average Selling Price: GM disclosed the impact of price in their variance analysis, showing a $0.7 billion favorable contribution to revenue.",

      "question": "How did GM Financial's management of commercial finance receivables in 2023 influence its approach to residual value estimates for leased vehicles in 2024, and what does this suggest about GM's evolving risk exposure in its automotive financing operations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM Financial reported $13.3 billion in dealer financing as part of its commercial finance receivables, indicating a significant exposure to automotive dealership credit risk. By 2024, GM Financial had incorporated greater sensitivity to forecast recovery rates and economic conditions into its allowance for loan losses, with a $0.1 billion change expected for every 5% shift in recovery rate assumptions. This reflects a more dynamic and forward-looking approach to credit risk management. Simultaneously, GM Financial\u2019s residual value estimates for leased vehicles were increasingly tied to forecasted auction proceeds and market conditions, with periodic adjustments made to reflect expected vehicle values at lease-end. The evolution from a primarily historical and dealer-focused credit exposure in 2023 to a broader, market-sensitive residual value risk framework in 2024 suggests that GM is adapting its financial operations to better manage volatility across both dealer financing and end-customer leasing channels.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM(2023) \u2192 GM Financial: GM depended on GM Financial, which reported $13.3 billion in dealer financing as part of its commercial finance receivables in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: GM Financial \u2192 Residual Values: GM Financial actively adjusted residual value estimates based on forecasted auction proceeds and market data, with potential for depreciation adjustments during the lease term.",
        "Hop 3: Residual Values \u2190 GM(2024): In 2024, GM\u2019s financial filings detailed how residual values were now more explicitly tied to economic forecasts and market volatility, reflecting a broader risk management strategy."

A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales Incentives The estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by approximately $0.4 billion. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses ex pected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a weighted-average remaining life of approximately two years. GM Financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the U.S. retail finance receivables portfolio of $2.1 billion. If the forecast economic conditions were based entirely on the weakest scenario considered, the allowance for loan losses would increase by $0.2 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of financing products for dealers and other businesses. GM Financial provides commercial lending  products  to  its  dealer  customers  that  include  floorplan  financing,  also  known  as  wholesale  or  inventory  financing,  which  is  lending  to  finance  vehicle inventory. GM Financial also provides dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Additionally, GM Financial provides lending products to commercial vehicle upfitters and advances to certain of our subsidiaries. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry conditions. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nValuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and Residuals GM Financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases. Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At the inception of a lease, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from one to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices.\n\nDuring the term of a lease, GM Financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward, which increases the prospective depreciation, or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), which decreases the prospective depreciation.",

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. V arious factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Noncredit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of ex it prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  Net realizable value is the estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  cost  to  sell,  and  considers  general  market  and  economic  conditions,  periodic  reviews  of  current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Inventories are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete, with a primary focus on productive material, supplies, work in process and parts and accessories.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of typically two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is  evaluated  over  the  life  of  the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes.",

      "answer": "Nike's Global Brand Divisions, which centrally manage product creation, design, digital operations, and enterprise technology, also oversee demand creation activities including advertising and marketing. According to the evidence, the increase in Demand Creation Expense from $3,850 million in 2022 to $4,285 million in 2024 was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expenses, as well as digital marketing, which falls under the purview of the Global Brand Divisions. This indicates that the rise in spending was directly tied to the strategic responsibilities of the Global Brand Divisions in driving brand visibility and consumer engagement through increased promotional efforts.",

As a result of changes to our capital market assumptions, the weighted-average long-term rate of return on assets decreased from 5.6% at December 31, 2020 to 5.4% at December 31, 2021. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.\n\nAnother  key  assumption  in  determining  net  pension  and  OPEB  expense  is  the  assumed  discount  rate  used  to  discount  plan obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.\n\nThe Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2021. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations as of December 31, 2021.\n\nSignificant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $3.7 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The year-over-year change is primarily due to an increase in discount rates and higher than expected asset returns.\n\nThe underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans improved in the year ended December 31, 2021 to $0.3 billion from $5.4 billion primarily due to: (1) the favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $3.7 billion; (2) the favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of $2.1 billion; and (3) changes in actuarial assumptions, demographic data updates and contributions of $0.5 billion; partially offset by (4) service and interest costs of $1.3 billion.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  sensitivity  to  a  change  in  certain  assumptions  for  the  pension  plans,  holding  all  other assumptions constant:\n\n",

We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.\n\nThe Society of Actuaries (SOA) issued mortality improvement tables in the three months ended December 31, 2021. We reviewed our recent mortality experience and we determined our current mortality assumptions are appropriate to measure our U.S. pension and OPEB plans obligations as of December 31, 2021.\n\nSignificant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations. The effects of actual results differing from assumptions and the changing of assumptions are included in unamortized net actuarial gains and losses that are subject to amortization to pension expense over future periods. The unamortized pre-tax actuarial loss on our pension plans was $3.7 billion and $8.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The year-over-year change is primarily due to an increase in discount rates and higher than expected asset returns.\n\nThe underfunded status of the U.S. pension plans improved in the year ended December 31, 2021 to $0.3 billion from $5.4 billion primarily due to: (1) the favorable effect of actual returns on plan assets of $3.7 billion; (2) the favorable effect of an increase in discount rates of $2.1 billion; and (3) changes in actuarial assumptions, demographic data updates and contributions of $0.5 billion; partially offset by (4) service and interest costs of $1.3 billion.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  sensitivity  to  a  change  in  certain  assumptions  for  the  pension  plans,  holding  all  other assumptions constant:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM disclosed that volume declines had a negative impact of $14.5 billion on total net sales and revenue, as seen in the comparison of 2021 to 2020 performance. This significant financial impact, tied to a drop in wholesale vehicle sales from 2,707 thousand units in 2020 to 2,308 thousand units in 2021, signaled a pressing need for strategic intervention. By 2023, GM elevated volume to a primary category in its consolidated results analysis, explicitly measuring the impact of changes in wholesale vehicle volumes driven by industry trends, market share, and dealer stock levels. This shift reflects a clear strategic evolution from 2022 to 2023 where GM transitioned from disclosing volume as a negative factor to actively prioritizing it in its operational strategy to mitigate future revenue losses.",

      "question": "Given GM's reliance on GM Financial for automotive financing in 2022, how did the increase in GM Financial's allowance for loan losses from $1.8 billion in 2022 to $2.3 billion in 2023 reflect changes in forecasted economic conditions and recovery rates, and what does this imply about GM's exposure to credit risk through its financing arm?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM depended on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and dealers, which exposed GM to risks related to GM Financial\u2019s ability to maintain competitive financing services. GM Financial estimated its allowance for loan losses at $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, based on economic forecast scenarios and recovery rates. By 2023, GM Financial increased its allowance for loan losses to $2.3 billion, reflecting a shift in economic outlook and forecasted recovery rates. This increase indicates that GM Financial anticipated higher credit losses, potentially due to deteriorating economic conditions or lower expected used vehicle prices, both of which would reduce recovery rates on defaulted loans. Since GM relies on GM Financial for financing services, this growing allowance suggests increased credit risk exposure for GM, particularly if economic conditions worsen and GM Financial\u2019s ability to absorb losses is strained. The weighted average remaining life of receivables (~2 years) further implies that the 2022 economic forecasts would still influence the 2023 allowance, but the increase shows a material shift in expected credit losses.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

      "answer": "GM's total automotive and other cost of sales increased by $9.7B from 2023 ($141.3B) to 2024 ($151.1B), driven by unfavorable volume and mix impacts. Despite these rising costs, GMI revenue improved by $1.6B (11.4%), primarily due to volume gains ($1.2B) and other factors ($0.8B), suggesting that international operations helped partially offset cost pressures. However, the magnitude of cost increases still outpaced revenue growth, indicating limited success in fully mitigating cost impacts through GMI alone.",

      "question": "How did the increase in NKE's Demand Creation Expense from $4,060 million in 2023 to $4,285 million in 2024 impact the performance of the Global Brand Divisions, particularly in relation to their role in centrally managing demand creation and brand-related operating overhead?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NKE reported a Demand Creation Expense of $4,060 million, which rose to $4,285 million in 2024\u2014an increase of $225 million. This rise was primarily attributed to higher advertising and marketing expenses, particularly in digital marketing, as noted in the Global Brand Divisions' operational summary. The Global Brand Divisions, which centrally manage demand creation and operating overhead expenses (including product design and global digital operations), experienced a 2% decrease in loss before interest and taxes in 2024. This modest improvement was driven by lower wage-related expenses, technology spend, and administrative costs, which partially offset the increased demand creation spending. Despite the higher investment in brand promotion, the segment's overall loss decreased slightly, suggesting that cost containment in other areas helped balance the increased marketing investment. This reflects a strategic shift toward reinforcing brand visibility through higher marketing spend while maintaining discipline in other operating overhead categories.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GMNA contributed $8.5 billion to the volume variance, which was part of its total revenue of $141.4 billion. By 2024, GMNA's contribution to volume variance increased to $12.8 billion, coinciding with a rise in GMNA's total revenue to $157.5 billion. This indicates that the North American segment's performance had a stronger impact on overall volume variance in 2024, reflecting higher sales volume growth compared to the previous year.",

      "question": "How did GM's reliance on GM Financial in 2022 influence the evolution of net credit losses by 2023, particularly in light of the increase in the allowance for loan losses from $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied heavily on GM Financial to provide competitive financing and leasing services to customers and dealers, which exposed GM to GM Financial's credit risk and operational performance. GM Financial disclosed an allowance for loan losses of $1.8 billion at the end of 2022, reflecting forecasted net credit losses based on economic conditions and recovery rates. By 2023, GM Financial increased its allowance for loan losses to $2.3 billion, indicating a more conservative outlook or deteriorating credit quality in its retail finance receivables portfolio. This increase suggests that GM's reliance on GM Financial in 2022 was followed by a strategic adjustment in 2023 to account for higher perceived credit risk, likely due to changing economic forecasts or lower recovery expectations. The evolution from $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion in the allowance for loan losses highlights how GM's financial services arm became a more significant risk factor over time, requiring increased provisioning and affecting GM's overall financial exposure.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Nike's Global Brand Divisions saw a 2% decrease in loss before interest and taxes, driven by lower operating overhead expenses, although demand creation expenses increased due to higher advertising and marketing spend. This improvement in financial performance allowed Nike to further increase demand creation investments in 2024, where advertising and marketing expenses rose as part of a broader 3% increase in selling and administrative expenses. The company strategically prioritized demand creation to support revenue growth, despite the increased cost, reflecting a shift toward leveraging financial efficiencies from the prior year to fuel brand momentum.",

      "answer": "In 2022, third-party seller sales were a key growth driver behind the 18% increase in North America sales, alongside advertising sales and reduced pricing strategies, despite fulfillment inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. By 2024, third-party seller sales continued to support North America growth, which rose 10%, now combined with advertising sales and subscription services as core contributors. The company emphasized sustained focus on price, selection, and convenience, including fast shipping offers, as part of the ongoing strategy to drive unit sales through third-party sellers. This reflects a continuation of the earlier growth mechanism but with a broader mix of revenue streams contributing to the overall growth trajectory.",

      "question": "How did the change in GM's unrecognized compensation expense related to Cruise between 2023 and 2024 reflect the impact of Cruise's stock incentive modifications and subsequent impairment charges?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM reported $0.7 billion in unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based awards for Cruise, which stemmed from modifications to RSUs and stock options that removed liquidity vesting conditions, triggering immediate expense recognition for 31 million RSUs. By 2024, despite the ongoing amortization of intangible assets ($146 million), GM recorded $142 million in impairment charges related to the write-off of technology and intellectual property associated with Cruise, signaling a strategic shift or reduced future value expectation from Cruise. This suggests that while Cruise's aggressive equity compensation strategy in 2023 aimed to retain talent and drive innovation, the 2024 impairment reflects a reversal in expected returns, potentially undermining the earlier investment in human capital.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported total net sales and revenue of $128,378 million, which increased by $13,067 million (10.2%) to $141,445 million in 2023. This growth in revenue was influenced by a favorable price variance of $3.2 billion, which positively impacted the average selling price. However, despite this price increase, GM's EBIT-adjusted margin decreased from 10.1% in 2022 to 8.7% in 2023, indicating that the positive impact from higher average selling prices was not sufficient to offset other cost and mix factors affecting profitability.",

By 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion impairment charge related to its SAIC-GMAC investment, indicating that actual losses exceeded initial credit loss assumptions derived from the receivables data.

These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "In 2022, Hardlines accounted for 29.7% of LOW's Total Sales, contributing $28,571 million out of $96,250 million total. By 2024, this proportion decreased to 29.0%, with Hardlines generating $24,256 million out of $83,674 million total sales. This indicates a relative decline in the strategic importance of Hardlines within the company's segment mix, suggesting a potential shift in focus toward other categories like Home D\u00e9cor or Building Products, which maintained or slightly increased their share of total sales during the same period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial reported gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $1.2 billion, which decreased to $0.9 billion in 2023 due to higher leased portfolio net book values at termination and fewer terminated leases. This decline in gains coincided with a decrease in the number of units in operating leases, indicating that GM may have adjusted its leasing strategy\u2014possibly reducing lease offerings or tightening credit criteria, as reflected in GM Financial\u2019s exposure to residual value risk and lease penetration levels.",

        "Hop 1: GM(2022) \u2192 Units in Operating Leases: GM disclosed the number of units in operating leases, which is tied to GM Financial\u2019s leasing program and residual value exposure.",
        "Hop 2: Units in Operating Leases \u2192 GM Financial: GM Financial's leasing program performance, including gains on lease terminations, is directly affected by the number and type of leased units.",
        "Hop 3: GM Financial \u2190 GM(2023): GM Financial's financial disclosures in 2023 show a decrease in lease gains and fewer lease terminations, indicating a strategic or market-driven shift in GM\u2019s leasing activity."

      "answer": "Starbucks' Goodwill Balance in the Channel Development Segment remained unchanged at $34.7 million from 2022 to 2024, despite fluctuations in other segments such as International, which decreased from $2,756.7 million to $2,788.5 million. This stability in the Channel Development Segment suggests a lack of significant acquisitions, impairments, or strategic investments in this area over the two-year period. The persistence of the same goodwill figure indicates that Starbucks did not materially alter its position or valuation in this segment, contrasting with the more dynamic changes seen in other parts of the business.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Nike's Global Brand Divisions reported $102 million in other revenues, which includes licensing and digital operations, setting a baseline for centrally managed functions. By fiscal 2024, the Global Brand Divisions' operating loss decreased by 2%, primarily due to lower operating overhead expenses, including reduced technology spend and wage-related costs. Specifically, in fiscal 2024, operating overhead expenses remained flat overall, as declines in wage-related expenses and technology spend were offset by restructuring charges. This indicates that Nike strategically reduced technology investments within the Global Brand Divisions to improve financial performance while balancing other cost increases, suggesting a more cost-conscious approach to technology spending.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Nike reported that higher full-price ASPs, driven by strategic pricing actions, contributed approximately 10 percentage points to footwear revenue growth and significantly influenced gross margin expansion. By 2024, this trend evolved further, with the NIKE Brand segment benefiting from higher full-price ASPs net of discounts, which increased gross margin by approximately 200 basis points due to continued strategic pricing actions. This demonstrates a clear temporal evolution where pricing strategies initiated in 2022 were refined and leveraged in 2024 to support gross margin improvements within the NIKE Brand segment.",

NIKE Direct revenues increased 15%, primarily due to comparable store sales growth of 30% due to improved physical retail traffic, in part resulting from temporary store closures and safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 in the prior year, as well as digital sales growth of 8%.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in the Jordan Brand and Men's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 10 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues increased 16% due primarily to higher revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel increased 9%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 7 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nReported EBIT increased 35% as gross margin expansion and higher revenues more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 570 basis points primarily due to higher NIKE Direct margins, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, a higher mix of full-price sales and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, partially offset by higher product costs. Higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, was largely due to strategic pricing actions, while higher product costs were primarily due to increased freight and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was driven by higher advertising and marketing expense. Higher operating overhead expense was primarily due to increases in wage-related expenses and professional services.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 38",

Within this decline, changes in price contributed a relatively small favorable variance of $0.2 billion, while volume and other factors had larger unfavorable impacts.

      "answer": "In 2023, GM provided Cruise with access to a $3.4 billion multi-year credit agreement for AV purchases and a framework agreement deferring up to $0.8 billion in engineering and capital spending, with $0.3 billion and $0.5 billion utilized respectively. Despite this support, Cruise's net sales and revenue remained flat at $102 billion in 2023 compared to the prior year, contributing minimally to GM's overall $157.667 billion in automotive net sales and revenue, which grew by $13.693 billion (9.5%) in 2023. By 2024, GM's total consolidated net sales and revenue increased further to $187.442 billion, showing continued growth, while Cruise's contribution remained unchanged. This indicates that Cruise's financial performance did not improve in line with GM's broader revenue growth despite receiving significant financial backing.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GMNA contributed $0.7 billion to mix variance, which was a smaller portion of the total $1.1 billion favorable mix variance for GM's automotive segment. By 2024, GMNA\u2019s contribution to mix variance increased significantly to $2.9 billion, representing the full $2.9 billion favorable mix variance for the automotive segment. This shift indicates that GMNA became the sole driver of mix variance improvements within the automotive segment year-over-year, playing a central role in the overall $15.6 billion increase in total net sales and revenue from 2023 to 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM(2023) \u2192 GMNA: GM's 2023 revenue from GMNA was $141.4B, with $0.7B attributed to mix variance.",
        "Hop 2: GMNA \u2192 Mix Variance: GMNA's mix variance contribution was a component of the broader automotive segment mix variance, which totaled $1.1B in 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Mix Variance \u2190 GM(2024): In 2024, GMNA's mix variance contribution increased to $2.9B, which fully accounted for the $2.9B favorable mix variance in the automotive segment."

      "question": "How did GM's reliance on GM Financial in 2022 relate to the changes in GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity by 2024, and what does this imply about GM's exposure to interest rate risk through its financing arm?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and dealers, and any reduction in GM Financial\u2019s ability to provide these services would negatively affect GM\u2019s vehicle sales and market penetration. GM Financial\u2019s net interest income sensitivity, which measures its exposure to interest rate risk, decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to a higher proportion of rate-sensitive liabilities relative to assets, making it more liability-sensitive. By 2024, GM Financial continued to manage this sensitivity through hedging strategies, with the company noting that a one hundred basis point decrease in interest rates would require assumptions of negative rates in certain markets. This implies that GM\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk through GM Financial evolved from a more asset-sensitive position in 2020 to a liability-sensitive position by 2021, and remained under active management through 2024, affecting how interest rate fluctuations impacted GM\u2019s broader financial performance.",

        "Hop 3: Net Interest Income Sensitivity \u2190 GM(2024): By 2024, GM Financial continued to disclose its net interest income sensitivity, noting that a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would require assumptions of negative rates in some markets, indicating ongoing exposure and active risk management."

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

The estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio, originations of finance receivables and leases, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement of maturing derivatives and exercise of options embedded in debt and derivatives. The prepayment projections are based on historical experience. If interest rates or other factors change, actual prepayment experience could be different than projected.\n\nForeign  Currency  Exchange  Rate  Risk GM Financial is exposed to foreign currency risk due to the translation and remeasurement of the results of certain international operations into U.S. dollars as part of the consolidation process. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can therefore create volatility in the results of operations and may adversely affect GM Financial's financial condition.\n\nGM Financial primarily finances its receivables and leased assets with debt in the same currency. When a different currency is used, GM Financial may use foreign currency swaps to convert substantially all of its foreign currency debt obligations to the local currency of the receivables and leased assets to minimize any impact to earnings. As a result, GM Financial believes its market risk ex posure relating to changes in currency ex change rates at December 31, 2024 was insignificant.\n\nGM Financial had foreign currency swaps with notional amounts of $8.4 billion and $8.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The net fair value of these derivative financial instruments was a liability of $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe following table summarizes GM Financial's foreign currency translation, transaction and remeasurement (gains) losses:\n\n",

Vendor allowances that are not reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are also included within cost of sales.\n\n## Vendor Allowances\n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of v olume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase lev els and co-op adv ertising allowances for the promotion of v endors' products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase lev els. These v endor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances receiv ed as a result of attaining certain purchase lev els accrued over the incentiv e period, which generally concludes at the end of the calendar year, based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op adv ertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inv entory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inv entory is sold.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrativ e expenses include compensation and benefits for retail and store support center associates, occupancy and operating costs of retail locations and store support centers, insurance-related expenses, adv ertising costs, credit and debit card processing fees, and other administrativ e costs.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs, including digital, telev ision, radio and print, are expensed when the adv ertisement first appears. Certain co-op adv ertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote v endors' products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. Net adv ertising expense included in SG&amp;A was $1.2 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.1 billion for fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nWe are currently authorized to issue incentiv e and nonqualified stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, stock appreciation rights, and deferred shares to certain of our associates and non-employee directors under certain stock incentiv e plans. We measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based payment awards made to associates and non-employee directors based on estimated fair v alues. The v alue of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to v est is recognized as stock-based compensation expense, on a straight-line basis, ov er the requisite serv ice period or as restrictions lapse. We include estimated forfeitures expected to occur when calculating stockbased compensation expense. Additional information on our stock-based payment awards is included in Note 9.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. We prov ide for federal, state, and foreign income taxes currently payable, as well as for those deferred due to timing differences between reporting income and expenses for financial statement purposes v ersus tax purposes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respectiv e tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recov ered or settled. The effect of a change in income tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We routinely ev aluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a v aluation allowance if, based on all av ailable ev idence, we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.\n\nWe recognize the effect of income tax positions only if those positions are more likely than not of being sustained. Recognized income tax positions are measured at the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized. Changes in recognition or measurement are reflected in the period in which the change in judgment occurs.\n\nWe recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters in interest expense and SG&amp;A, respectiv ely, on our consolidated statements of earnings. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in other accrued expenses and other long-term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Fiscal 2024 Form  10-K",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services, which were critical for supporting vehicle sales and dealer relationships. By 2023, GM Financial's dealer financing increased from $10.6 billion to $13.3 billion, indicating a stronger dependency by GM on its financing arm. This increase was accompanied by a rise in 'Other Financing' from $362 million to $476 million, which includes loans to commercial vehicle upfitters. The growth in both categories suggests that GM's strategic reliance on GM Financial deepened in 2023, expanding beyond traditional dealer financing into broader commercial financing activities. This evolution reflects a shift in GM's financial services strategy to include more diverse financing offerings, as evidenced by the growth in GM Financial's commercial finance receivables and the inclusion of other financing streams.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial was in a liability-sensitive position, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. This made the company vulnerable to rising interest rates, which would cause interest expenses to rise faster than interest income, potentially compressing margins. In response to this sensitivity, GM strategically increased its dealer floorplan financing from $10.6 billion in 2022 to $13.3 billion by 2023. Floorplan financing is typically variable-rate financing tied directly to inventory levels and short-term borrowing rates, aligning with GM Financial\u2019s liability-sensitive profile by allowing it to earn interest income that re-prices more frequently. This strategic shift likely helped GM Financial better match the re-pricing characteristics of its assets and liabilities, mitigating interest rate risk while supporting automotive dealerships.",

The estimates are also based on assumptions including the amortization and prepayment of the finance receivable portfolio, originations of finance receivables and leases, refinancing of maturing debt, replacement  of  maturing  derivatives  and  exercise  of  options  embedded  in  debt  and  derivatives.  The  prepayment  projections  are based  on  historical  experience.  If  interest  rates  or  other  factors  change,  actual  prepayment  experience  could  be  different  than projected.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, NKE's Global Brand Divisions experienced a 17% increase in operating loss, driven by higher demand creation expenses, including advertising and marketing spend. By 2023, advertising and marketing expenses continued to rise as part of a broader increase in demand creation expense, which contributed to a 2% overall increase in selling and administrative expenses. Despite this, the company saw a 6% increase in footwear revenues and a 14% increase in apparel revenues on a currency-neutral basis in 2023, particularly in Men's, Women's, and the Jordan Brand. This suggests that while increased advertising spend placed upward pressure on costs, it may have contributed to revenue growth in key categories, indicating a potential improvement in the efficiency of demand creation efforts compared to 2022.",

This was consistent with the typical accounting treatment of international segment results, which include retail sales made through internationally-focused channels, as outlined in the segment reporting structure. By 2024, however, the exposure had evolved: while Nike hedged some currency risks, the company noted that weakening foreign currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar were adversely affecting the dollar value of foreign-denominated retail sales and earnings.

Interest and penalties, net of federal income tax benefit, recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2020, and 2021 was $4 million, $(48) million, and $28 million.\n\nWe are under examination, or may be subject to examination, by the Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') for the calendar year 2016 and thereafter. These examinations may lead to ordinary course adjustments or proposed adjustments to our taxes or our net operating losses with respect to years under examination as well as subsequent periods. We resolved the audits of tax years 2007 through 2015 with the IRS for amounts that were materially consistent with our accrual.\n\nIn October 2014, the European Commission opened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard to the corporate income tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that determinations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision the European Commission announced an estimated recovery amount of approximately \u20ac250 million, plus interest, for the period May 2006 through June 2014, and ordered Luxembourg tax authorities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount, consistent with the European Commission's decision, which we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. In December 2017, Luxembourg appealed the European Commission's decision. In May 2018, we appealed. On May 12, 2021, the European Union General Court annulled the European Commission's state aid decision. In July 2021, the European Commission appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice. We will continue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictions including China, France, Germany, India, Japan, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009 and thereafter.\n\nChanges in tax laws, regulations, administrative practices, principles, and interpretations may impact our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax controversies is highly uncertain, and the amounts ultimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It is reasonably possible that within the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income tax controversies in one or more jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on prior years' tax filings. The actual amount of any change could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currently provide an estimate of the range of possible outcomes.\n\n## Note 10 - SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nWe have organized our operations into three segments: North America, International, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses 'Fulfillment,' 'Technology and content,' 'Marketing,' and 'General and administrative' based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which the costs are incurred. The majority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure technology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between our reportable segments. These segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company's business performance and manages its operations.\n\n## North America\n\nThe North America segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through North America-focused online and physical stores. This segment includes export sales from these online stores.\n\n## International\n\nThe International segment primarily consists of amounts earned from retail sales of consumer products (including from sellers) and subscriptions through internationally-focused online stores. This segment includes export sales from these internationally-focused online stores (including export sales from these online stores to customers in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada), but excludes export sales from our North America-focused online stores.\n\n## AWS\n\nThe AWS segment consists of amounts earned from global sales of compute, storage, database, and other services for start-ups, enterprises, government agencies, and academic institutions.",

C entral banks deploy various strategies to com bat inflation, including increasing interest rates, which im pact our borrowing costs. G overnm ent shutdowns or the risk of governm ent shutdowns, as well as the im pact or expected im pact of elections, both in the U nited States and in other countries around the world, m ay also increase volatility. Additionally, there has been, and m ay continue to be, volatility in currency exchange rates that im pact the U .S. D ollar value relative to other international currencies. O ur international revenues and expenses generally are derived from  sales and operations in foreign currencies, and these revenues and expenses are affected by currency fluctuations, specifically am ounts recorded in foreign currencies and translated into U .S. D ollars for consolidated financial reporting, as weakening of foreign currencies relative to the U .S. D ollar adversely affects the U .S. D ollar value of the C om pany's foreign currency-denom inated sales and earnings. C urrency exchange rate fluctuations could also disrupt the business of the independent m anufacturers that produce our products by m aking their purchases of raw m aterials m ore expensive and m ore difficult to finance. F oreign currency fluctuations have adversely affected and could continue to have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe hedge certain foreign currency exposures to lessen and delay, but not to com pletely elim inate, the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on our financial results. Since the hedging activities are designed to lessen volatility, they not only reduce the negative im pact of a stronger U .S. D ollar or other trading currency, but they also reduce the positive im pact of a weaker U .S. D ollar or other trading currency. O ur future financial results have in the past been and could in the future be significantly affected by the value of the U .S. D ollar in relation to the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. The degree to which our financial results are affected for any given tim e period will depend in part upon our hedging activities.\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the financial health of our wholesale customers.\n\nWe extend credit to our custom ers based on an assessm ent of a custom er's financial condition, generally without requiring collateral. T o assist in the scheduling of production and the shipping of our products, we offer certain custom ers the opportunity to place orders five to six m onths ahead of delivery under our futures ordering program . T hese advance orders may be canceled under certain conditions, and the risk of cancellation increases when dealing with financially unstable retailers or retailers struggling with econom ic uncertainty. In the past, som e custom ers have experienced financial difficulties up to and including bankruptcies, which have had an adverse effect on our sales, our ability to collect on receivables and our financial condition. W hen the retail econom y weakens or as consum er behavior shifts, retailers tend to be m ore cautious with orders. A slowing or changing econom y in our key m arkets, including a recession, could adversely affect the financial health of our custom ers, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. I n addition, product sales are dependent in part on high quality m erchandising and an appealing retail environm ent to attract consum ers, which requires continuing investm ents by retailers. R etailers that experience financial difficulties m ay fail to m ake such investm ents or delay them , resulting in lower sales and orders for our products.\n\n## Climate change and other sustainability-related matters, or legal, regulatory or market responses thereto, may have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nThere are concerns that increased levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atm osphere have caused, and m ay continue to cause, potentially at a growing rate, increases in global tem peratures, changes in weather patterns and increasingly frequent and/or prolonged extrem e weather and clim ate events. C lim ate change m ay also exacerbate challenges relating to the availability and quality of water and raw m aterials, including those used in the production of our products, and m ay result in changes in regulations or consum er preferences, which could in turn affect our business, operating results and financial condition. F or exam ple, there has been increased focus by governm ental and nongovernm ental organizations, consum ers, custom ers, em ployees and other stakeholders on products that are sustainably m ade and other sustainability m atters, including responsible sourcing and deforestation, the use of plastic, energy and water, the recyclability or recoverability of packaging and m aterials transparency, any of which m ay require us to incur increased costs for additional transparency, due diligence and reporting. In addition, federal, state or local governm ental authorities in various countries are im plem enting, have proposed and are likely to continue to propose, legislative and regulatory initiatives to reduce or m itigate the im pacts of clim ate change on the environm ent. Various countries and regions are following different approaches to the regulation of clim ate change, which could increase the com plexity of, and potential cost related to com plying with, such regulations. Any of the foregoing m ay require us to m ake additional investm ents in facilities and equipm ent, m ay im pact the availability and cost of key raw m aterials used in the production of our products or the dem and for our products, and, in turn, m ay adversely im pact our business, operating results and financial condition.\n\nI nvestors, regulators and other stakeholders are also increasingly scrutinizing com panies' environm ental, social and governance ('E SG ') com m itm ents, perform ance and disclosures, including related to clim ate change, and in recent years have placed increasing im portance on social costs and related im plications of their investm ents.

      "answer": "Home Depot's net advertising expense increased from $904 million in fiscal 2019 to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2023. In fiscal 2019, the net advertising expense was part of a historical table showing a gradual rise from $904 million to $1,044 million by fiscal 2021. By fiscal 2023, the company maintained a consistent $1.1 billion spend in both fiscal 2022 and 2023. This represents a significant increase from the earlier period and suggests a strategic decision to stabilize or sustain higher advertising investments over time. The shift from a growing trend in the earlier years to a stable level in the later years may indicate a maturation of marketing efforts or a deliberate long-term brand positioning strategy.",

Also contributing to the decline in international total net revenues were lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees ($69 million), largely driven by continued disruptions due to multiple international conflicts, partially offset by the performance of 654 net new licensed store openings over the past 12 months. These decreases were partially offset by net new company-operated store growth of 10%, or 893 stores, over the past 12 months ($378 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nInternational operating income for fiscal 2024 decreased 15% to $1.0 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Operating margin contracted 220 basis points to 14.2%, primarily due to increased promotional activity (approximately 170 basis points) and investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies (approx imately 100 basis points).",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM International reported net sales of $15.949 billion, reflecting a significant portion of the company\u2019s global footprint, particularly in China. However, by 2024, GM International's net sales had declined to $13.890 billion, a decrease of $2.059 billion or 12.9%, as detailed in the 2024 financial tables. This decline occurred alongside GM's intensified focus on electrification and North American expansion, as outlined in the 2024 10-K filing. The document highlights major investments in EV manufacturing facilities such as Factory ZERO and CAMI Assembly, as well as plans to convert Orion Assembly for electric pickups. Additionally, GM announced strategic charging infrastructure partnerships and joined the IONNA joint venture to build a North American fast-charging network. The reduction in international sales appears aligned with a reallocation of strategic focus and capital investment toward North America to support electric vehicle production and charging infrastructure, signaling a shift in GM\u2019s geographic and technological priorities.",

Business\n\nGeneral Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, G eneral Motors or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development of autonomous vehicle (AV ) technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs)  and  AV s,  software-enabled  services  and  subscriptions  and  new  business  opportunities,  while  strengthening  our  market  position  in  profitable  internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\n\nElectric Vehicles We are offering customers choice with our diverse EV  lineup. A key element in our EV  strategy is our dedicated EV  propulsion architecture. Our current-generation, flexible EV  platform is being deployed across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, leveraging our technology to expand our EV portfolio over a wide and growing variety of segments and price points. With our next-generation battery technology, we intend to expand to multiple chemistries, multiple form factors and multiple cell suppliers as we continue to deliver even more EV choices for our customers.\n\nTo support our expanding portfolio of EV s, we have made significant investments in our plants across North America. GM's Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center is a fully dedicated EV  facility which produces a variety of vehicles, including the GMC HUMMER EV  Pickup and SUV , the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the recently launched Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, with globally sourced parts. GM's CAMI Assembly is Canada's first full-scale EV  manufacturing facility. We plan to convert Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan to build electric pickups, with the plant slated to begin production in 2026. GM is also investing in our propulsion, stamping and components plants to support EV production. We are mass-producing battery cells for these and other future EV s through Ultium Cells Holdings LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG  Energy Solution) in plants in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee, with plans to expand our battery cell manufacturing footprint, including in Indiana through a joint venture with Samsung SDI.\n\nGM's all-electric future is guided by customer choice and focused on delivering a world-class portfolio of EV s and an ecosystem to support them, while maintaining a compelling lineup of gas-powered vehicles. GM EV  drivers have access to more than 231,000 chargers across North America. This includes access to more than 20,000  Tesla  Superchargers  with  the  use  of  a  G M-approved  North American  Charging  Standard  adapter.  In  2024,  GM  also  announced  that  it  will  enhance  its collaboration with EV go to build 2,850 DC fast charging stalls, including 400 fast chargers at flagship destinations in major metropolitan areas across the U.S. GM is also a founding member of IONNA, a joint venture with seven other automakers aiming to create a high-powered charging network with a targeted installation of at least 30,000 chargers in urban and highway locations throughout North America. The joint venture broke ground on its first charging station in October 2024.\n\nSoftware-Enabled Services and Subscriptions Our vehicles are equipped with a suite of software-enabled services, including OnStar services, Super Cruise and others. With nearly three decades of experience, OnStar is a global leader in enabling automotive services. OnStar is currently available in 20 markets globally and growing. As  GM  introduces  more  software-defined  vehicles,  OnStar  is  playing  a  key  role  as  an  enabler  of  active  safety,  infotainment,  connectivity  and  driver assistance features. OnStar provides one ecosystem for retail and fleet customers to use, engage and shop through a broader set of service offerings available at and after vehicle purchase.

      "question": "How did the increase in GM's total net sales and revenue from $171.8B in 2023 to $187.4B in 2024 influence the magnitude of eliminations, and what does this suggest about internal intersegment activity or consolidation adjustments?",
      "answer": "GM's total net sales and revenue increased from $171.8B in 2023 to $187.4B in 2024, a growth of $15.6B or 9.1%. This growth was accompanied by a significant rise in eliminations, which increased from $151M in 2023 to $296M in 2024 \u2014 a $145M or 96% increase. The rise in eliminations suggests a corresponding increase in intersegment transactions or internal reclassifications that needed to be removed during consolidation. This pattern indicates that as GM's overall business activity grew year-over-year, so too did the internal interdependencies between segments, requiring larger adjustments to present accurate consolidated financial results.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Selling and Administrative Expense from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2024 relate to the role and performance of Nike's Global Brand Divisions, particularly in light of changes in demand creation and digital investment strategies?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, the Global Brand Divisions experienced a 17% increase in loss before interest and taxes, driven by a rise in Selling and Administrative Expense, which was attributed to higher operating overhead and demand creation costs, including strategic technology investments and digital capabilities. By fiscal 2024, Selling and Administrative Expense increased again by 1%, with demand creation expense rising due to digital marketing and sports marketing, despite a reduction in operating overhead costs, particularly wage-related expenses. This indicates that while Nike continued to invest in demand creation and digital strategies through the Global Brand Divisions, the nature of the investment shifted from broad digital infrastructure in 2022 to more targeted marketing in 2024, even as overall expense growth moderated.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: NKE(2022) \u2192 Global Brand Divisions: The Global Brand Divisions reported a 17% increase in loss before interest and taxes due to higher selling and administrative expense driven by digital investments and demand creation.",
        "Hop 2: Global Brand Divisions \u2192 Selling and Administrative Expense: The divisions' expenses include centrally managed demand creation and digital operations, which directly influence overall selling and administrative costs.",
        "Hop 3: Selling and Administrative Expense \u2190 NKE(2024): In 2024, Selling and Administrative Expense increased by 1%, with higher demand creation costs offsetting reductions in operating overhead, showing continued investment in brand promotion."

      "question": "How did the change in GM's residual value exposure through GM Financial from 2022 to 2024 reflect shifts in the composition and valuation of leased vehicles, particularly in light of GM Financial's risk related to vehicle return rates and used car pricing volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services, which exposed GM to risks related to residual value performance on leased vehicles. GM Financial faced potential losses if vehicle return rates increased or if auction values fell below residual estimates. By 2024, GM Financial reported a total estimated residual value of $23.5 billion across 943,000 leased vehicles, with crossovers making up the largest segment at $13.184 billion (67.3%). This represented an increase in residual value exposure from $22.661 billion in 2023, even though the number of leased vehicles slightly decreased from 960,000 to 943,000. The shift in composition showed a decline in residual value for cars from $734 million to $590 million, indicating a strategic move away from lower-value segments. The evolution of the GM Financial \u2192 Residual Value link shows GM's growing exposure to residual risk, particularly in higher-value segments like crossovers and trucks, which could amplify financial impact from market fluctuations.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its ex pected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1)  the  sum  of  remaining  lease  payments  plus  estimated  residual  value;  over  (2)  leased  vehicles,  net  less  deferred  revenue. Alternatively,  if  used  vehicle  prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  effect  of  a  1%  relative  change  in  the  estimated  residual  values  at  December  31,  2024,  which  could  increase  or  decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM's commercial finance receivables, which include dealer financing of $13.3 billion and other financing of $476 million, highlight a strong dependency on GM Financial for financial services. In 2024, GM Financial reported leased vehicle income of $7,811 million, indicating a significant revenue stream. This shows that while GM continued to rely on GM Financial for commercial financing, the segment increasingly contributed through leased vehicle income, suggesting a strategic shift or expansion in GM Financial's role in supporting GM's financial ecosystem.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Nike's Global Brand Divisions reported a 2% decrease in loss before interest and taxes, driven by lower operating overhead expenses but partially offset by higher demand creation expenses, including digital marketing. By 2024, Nike's Digital Marketing Expense had increased further, contributing to a 1% rise in Selling and Administrative expenses, as noted in the 2024 report. This indicates a strategic shift toward prioritizing demand creation through digital channels, even as broader operating costs were reduced. The evolution from a focus on cost containment in 2023 to increased investment in digital marketing in 2024 suggests a deliberate effort to drive brand engagement and long-term revenue growth through digital transformation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial's allowance for loan losses was heavily influenced by historical loss experience, with forecasted recovery rates based on high used vehicle prices from 2021, where a 5% decrease in recovery rates would have increased the allowance by $0.1 billion. By 2024, GM Financial continued to use historical loss experience but supplemented it with static pool modeling and economic forecasts, including unemployment rates and GDP growth, to better align with expected credit losses over the remaining life of receivables. This shift indicates a more forward-looking and economically sensitive approach to managing credit risk, suggesting that GM Financial's risk profile became more dynamic and responsive to macroeconomic conditions over time.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nFair Value Measurements A three-level valuation hierarchy, based upon observable and unobservable inputs, is used for fair value measurements. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. V arious factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Noncredit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of ex it prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  Net realizable value is the estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  cost  to  sell,  and  considers  general  market  and  economic  conditions,  periodic  reviews  of  current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Inventories are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete, with a primary focus on productive material, supplies, work in process and parts and accessories.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of typically two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is  evaluated  over  the  life  of  the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes.",

      "question": "How did GM's restructuring of financial support through GM Financial in 2022 impact Cruise's borrowing capacity in 2023, particularly with the $3.4 billion credit agreement for AV purchases?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to dealers and customers, and any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide these services would negatively affect GM\u2019s market penetration (Hop 1). By 2023, GM Financial had entered into a multi-year credit agreement with Cruise, allowing it to borrow up to $3.4 billion through 2024 to fund the purchase of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and related equipment from GM (Hop 2). This financial arrangement supported Cruise\u2019s liquidity needs, as evidenced by the $0.3 billion in borrowings already drawn by December 31, 2023 (Hop 2). GM\u2019s strategic use of GM Financial as a financial conduit in 2022 thus directly enabled Cruise to access critical capital in 2023, facilitating the development and deployment of AVs under GM\u2019s broader electrification and autonomy roadmap (Hop 3).",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How did the decline in HD's NOPAT from $18,294 million in fiscal 2022 to $16,424 million in fiscal 2024 impact its ROIC, and what does this reveal about the company's capital efficiency trajectory over this period?",
      "answer": "HD's ROIC declined from 44.7% in fiscal 2021 (reported for fiscal 2021 but calculated using NOPAT from the prior year) to 31.3% in fiscal 2024, with NOPAT falling from $18,294 million in fiscal 2022 to $16,424 million in fiscal 2024. This drop in NOPAT, a key component of ROIC, directly contributed to the reduced return on invested capital, signaling a weakening in the company's capital efficiency. The decline reflects either a reduced ability to generate profit from its invested capital or an increase in the capital base that was not proportionally matched by profit growth, as average debt and equity rose from $41,055 million in fiscal 2022 to $52,431 million in fiscal 2024.",

We opened five new stores in the U.S. and two new stores in Mexico during fiscal 2021, resulting in a total store count of 2,317 at January 30, 2022, which includes 14 stores in the U.S. from a small acquisition completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. At the end of fiscal 2021, a total of 311 of our stores, or 13.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $604.74 in fiscal 2021. Our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2020. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment.\n\nWe generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt during fiscal 2021. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $14.8 billion for share repurchases, pay $7.0 billion of dividends, fund $2.6 billion in capital expenditures, and repay an aggregate of $1.5 billion of long-term debt. In February 2022, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.90 per share.\n\nOur ROIC was 44.7% for fiscal 2021 and 40.8% for fiscal 2020.

      "answer": "In 2023, GM disclosed that residual values for leased vehicles were based on forecasted auction proceeds and were subject to adjustment based on changes in market conditions. By 2024, GM Financial was actively adjusting these residual values during the lease term in response to updated market data, including auction values and economic forecasts. This adjustment mechanism directly influenced GM Financial\u2019s allowance for loan losses, which stood at $2.1 billion at the end of 2024. The allowance was sensitive to forecast recovery rates \u2014 a 5% decrease would increase the allowance by $0.1 billion. These financial pressures, combined with broader economic challenges, contributed to a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge by GM Financial on its SAIC-GMAC investment in 2024, which was part of a larger $4.4 billion equity loss from GM\u2019s China joint ventures.

A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales Incentives The estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by approximately $0.4 billion. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses ex pected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a weighted-average remaining life of approximately two years. GM Financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the U.S. retail finance receivables portfolio of $2.1 billion. If the forecast economic conditions were based entirely on the weakest scenario considered, the allowance for loan losses would increase by $0.2 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of financing products for dealers and other businesses. GM Financial provides commercial lending  products  to  its  dealer  customers  that  include  floorplan  financing,  also  known  as  wholesale  or  inventory  financing,  which  is  lending  to  finance  vehicle inventory. GM Financial also provides dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Additionally, GM Financial provides lending products to commercial vehicle upfitters and advances to certain of our subsidiaries. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry conditions. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nValuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and Residuals GM Financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases. Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At the inception of a lease, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from one to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices.\n\nDuring the term of a lease, GM Financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward, which increases the prospective depreciation, or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), which decreases the prospective depreciation.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSGM is a joint venture we established with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) (50%). SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How did the composition and contribution of miscellaneous revenues within Nike's Global Brand Divisions change from fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2023, and what does this indicate about the strategic role of these revenues in the company's overall financial structure?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, miscellaneous revenues were explicitly included within the Global Brand Divisions and were described as revenues not part of geographic operating segments, such as NIKE Brand licensing. By fiscal 2023, these miscellaneous revenues totaled $102 million under the Global Brand Divisions, representing a distinct but small portion of total NIKE Brand revenues ($44,436 million). The Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes decreased by 2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, indicating some efficiency improvements despite higher demand creation expenses. This suggests that while miscellaneous revenues remained a minor component, their continued inclusion in the Global Brand Divisions highlights a strategic alignment of non-core revenue streams within centralized brand management functions.",

By fiscal 2024, NIKE Brand product costs were reduced on a wholesale equivalent basis, contributing approximately 10 basis points to the overall gross margin increase of 110 basis points (from 43.5% in 2023 to 44.6% in 2024). This cost reduction was primarily attributed to lower ocean freight and logistics costs, despite higher product input costs. To protect against currency fluctuations that could impact these product costs, NIKE implemented a foreign exchange hedging strategy targeting product cost exposures, particularly for non-functional currency-denominated product purchases. These hedges aimed to stabilize cost structures and preserve margin gains achieved through operational efficiencies.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM's Net Sales and Revenue stood at $127.0 billion, with GM Financial contributing $11.7 billion from the U.S. and $1.7 billion from non-U.S. operations. By 2024, GM's total Net Sales and Revenue increased to $187.4 billion, with GM Financial's revenue rising by $1.65 billion to $15.875 billion. However, this growth coincided with significant impairments in GM Financial's investments, particularly in SAIC-GMAC, where a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment was recorded due to declining market conditions in China. This indicates that while GM Financial's revenue increased year-over-year, the financial health of its international investments deteriorated, reflecting the broader challenges in the Chinese automotive market.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Starbucks' International Segment experienced a revenue decline, particularly in licensee-related revenue, which fell by $69 million. This decline in performance contributed to a reduction in the goodwill balance allocated to the International Segment, which dropped from $2,756.7 million in 2022 to $2,691.1 million in 2023. However, by fiscal 2024, the goodwill balance for the International Segment increased to $2,788.5 million, indicating a recovery and renewed confidence in the segment's long-term value. This suggests that despite short-term revenue challenges in 2023, Starbucks' strategic assessment of its international markets improved by 2024, likely due to positive fair value assessments and future growth projections, as noted in the 2024 audit report.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "question": "How did GM's 2022 pension expense sensitivity to discount rates for U.S. Plans relate to the projected decline in U.S. pension benefit obligations shown in the 2024 filings?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM disclosed that a 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate would increase the U.S. Plans' projected benefit obligation (PBO) by $1,502 million, while a 25 basis point increase would reduce the PBO by $1,439 million (GM_10k_2022.pdf:page_47:chunk_2). This sensitivity highlights how changes in actuarial assumptions significantly impact pension liabilities. The 2024 filings show a steady projected decline in U.S. pension benefit payments from $4,282 million in 2025 to $3,580 million in 2029, indicating a downward trend in obligations over time (GM_10k_2024.pdf:page_90:chunk_2). This suggests that either discount rates increased or pension obligations were actively managed downward between reporting periods, aligning with the sensitivity analysis from 2022.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM reported a PBO of $4,953 million for its non-U.S. pension plans. By 2024, this figure had decreased to $496 million, indicating a significant reduction in the estimated future pension obligations. This change coincided with GM's updated long-term rate of return on pension assets, which increased from 6.3% in 2023 to 6.5% in 2024 for U.S. plans, with non-U.S. plans following a similar methodology. The drop in PBO suggests that GM may have revised its actuarial assumptions or experienced favorable changes in plan demographics or funding levels, which, combined with the higher expected return rate, could signal a more optimistic outlook on pension liability management. This implies a strategic shift toward more efficient pension fund utilization or liability reduction.",

If  a  decrease  in  residual  values  is concentrated among specific asset groups, the decrease could result in an immediate impairment charge. GM Financial reviewed the leased vehicle portfolio for indicators of impairment and determined that no material impairment indicators were present at December 31, 2024 or 2023.\n\nPension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and ex pectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include  Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis.  The expected long-term rate of return on  U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.\n\nIn December 2024, an investment policy study was completed for the U.S. pension plans. As a result, the weighted-average long-term rate of Return on Assets (ROA) increased to 6.5% at December 31, 2024 from 6.3% at December 31, 2023. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used in determining pension expense for non-U.S. plans is determined in a similar manner to the U.S. plans.\n\nAnother  key  assumption  in  determining  net  pension  and  other  postretirement  benefits  (OPEB)  ex pense  is  the  assumed  discount  rate  used  to  discount  plan obligations. We estimate the assumed discount rate for U.S. plans using a cash flow matching approach, which uses projected cash flows matched to spot rates along a high quality corporate bond yield curve to determine the weighted-average discount rate for the calculation of the present value of cash flows. We apply the individual annual yield curve rates instead of the assumed discount rate to determine the service cost and interest cost, which more specifically links the cash flows related to service cost and interest cost to bonds maturing in their year of payment.\n\nSignificant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the pension obligations.

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated.

      "question": "Given that Starbucks' Corporate and Other Segment maintained a consistently minimal goodwill balance of $1.0 million in both 2023 and 2024, how did this contrast with the level of scrutiny applied to the much larger $2,788.5 million international segment goodwill balance in 2024 during impairment testing?",
      "answer": "Starbucks' Corporate and Other Segment had a nominal goodwill balance of $1.0 million in both 2023 and 2024, indicating minimal risk of impairment and requiring little to no detailed testing. In contrast, the international segment held a substantial $2,788.5 million goodwill balance in 2024, which included the China reporting unit. This large balance necessitated a detailed and rigorous impairment assessment using both income and market approaches, as disclosed in the 2024 audit report. The disparity in goodwill amounts directly influenced the extent of impairment scrutiny, with the international segment receiving significantly more attention due to its materiality and potential risk.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SBUX(2023) \u2192 Corporate and Other Segment: The goodwill balance in the Corporate and Other Segment remained stable at $1.0 million.",
        "Hop 2: Corporate and Other Segment \u2192 Goodwill Balance: The segment's minimal goodwill contribution had negligible impact on overall impairment risk.",
        "Hop 3: Goodwill Balance \u2190 SBUX(2024): The international segment's goodwill balance, particularly in China, was substantial at $2,788.5 million, requiring detailed impairment testing."

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "question": "How did the presentation of non-geographic revenues within the Global Brand Divisions change from fiscal 2022 to 2023, and what might this shift indicate about Nike's evolving segment reporting and centralized revenue visibility?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Nike described 'Miscellaneous Revenues' as part of the Global Brand Divisions but did not provide a specific dollar amount, only noting that these revenues were not part of geographic operating segments. By fiscal 2023, these same revenues were explicitly quantified as $102 million under the 'Other' category in the Global Brand Divisions column. This shift indicates that Nike increased transparency in its segment reporting, providing clearer visibility into centralized revenue streams that were previously disclosed only conceptually. The change suggests a more detailed and structured approach to financial reporting in fiscal 2023 compared to the more generalized disclosures in fiscal 2022.",

      "question": "How did the 71% increase in commercial finance receivables from GM consolidated dealers (from $164M in 2023 to $279M in 2024) reflect changes in GM's dealer financing strategy compared to their 2022 risk management approach through GM Financial?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied heavily on GM Financial to provide commercial lending to dealers, with proprietary models used to assign risk ratings and periodic credit reviews conducted to manage exposure. By 2024, the commercial finance receivables from GM consolidated dealers had increased by 71%\u2014from $164 million in 2023 to $279 million\u2014indicating a more aggressive or expanded dealer financing strategy. This growth suggests that GM, through GM Financial, may have either loosened credit standards, increased support for new or existing dealerships, or expanded its dealer network. The increase also implies a strategic shift from the 2022 emphasis on risk mitigation through structured credit reviews and risk ratings, pointing to a more growth-oriented approach in dealer financing in 2024.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM Financial estimated the residual value of its leased vehicles at $22.7 billion, with depreciation and impairment risk tied directly to used vehicle price performance.

This decline contributed to GM Financial recording a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC. The broader financial strain from declining residual values and poor market conditions in China ultimately led to a total impairment charge of $2.1 billion on GM\u2019s equity interests in its Chinese joint ventures in 2024, showing a cascading impact through the entity chain.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nwe believe independent, Chinese automakers are expanding market share and prioritizing production volumes over profitability, with the ability to produce vehicles at costs well below foreign automakers, including our Automotive China JV s. These factors are impacting our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. We are in the late stages of finalizing details with our JV  partners on an agreement regarding certain restructuring actions, which include plant closures and portfolio optimization to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions, and updated business forecasts.\n\nBased on the updated forecast, we determined that the material loss in value of our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), SAIC GM (Shenyang) Norsom Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM Norsom), SAIC GM Dong Y ue Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM DY) and SAIC GM Dong Y ue Powertrain Co., Ltd. (SGM DYPT) was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024 which is included in equity income (loss). Our Automotive China JV s' equity losses also includes non-cash charges of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of the restructuring plan. We expect additional restructuring charges are likely to be incurred in 2025. G oing forward, we will continue to assess our strategy in the Chinese market to maintain presence while prioritizing profitability. In addition, G M Financial also concluded that a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC) existed. Refer to the \"Automotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook' section of this MD&amp;A for discussion of GM Financial's other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 25.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.9 million units for a market share of 3.7% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nCruise Cruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV  technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed development work on the Cruise Origin and recorded restructuring charges of $0.6 billion primarily related to noncash write-offs of Origin assets. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. Refer to Part I, Item 1. Business for a further discussion on Cruise. In conjunction with our announcement to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and our plans to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges of $0.5 billion.  These  charges  primarily  relate  to  anticipated  headcount  reductions  and  impairments  of  real  estate  lease  assets  and  certain intangible assets.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 39% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 42% in the corresponding period in 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing  programs  available  and  competing  third-party  financing  products  in  the  market.  G M  Financial's  prime  loan  originations  as  a  percentage  of  total  loan originations in North America was 81% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 82% in the corresponding period in 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2024, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 46%, retail finance charge income of 40% and commercial finance charge income of 8%.\n\nGM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. G ains on terminations of leased vehicles of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion were included in G M Financial interest, operating and other ex penses in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in gains is primarily due to fewer terminated leases in 2024 compared to 2023. The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon reported that international sales increased by 22% in 2021 compared to the prior year, with growth primarily attributed to increased unit sales, including those from third-party sellers, despite fulfillment and supply chain challenges. By 2024, international sales growth had slowed to 9%, still driven by unit sales and third-party seller activity, but at a reduced pace. This indicates that while the unit sales strategy, including third-party sellers, remained a consistent driver of international growth, its impact diminished over time, potentially signaling market saturation or increased competitive pressure in international regions.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial anticipated that used vehicle prices would decrease from 2021 levels but remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. However, by 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its SAIC-GMAC investment, which was tied to declining residual values and worsening market conditions in China. This indicates that the earlier projected moderation in used vehicle price declines evolved into a more severe and sustained downturn, increasing the risk exposure in GM's automotive financing segment and leading to direct financial losses through asset impairments.",

Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.",

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\n\nGMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States.

All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles.

GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "In 2023, Tesla disclosed that the allowance for expected credit losses on its MyPower customer notes receivable was $36 million. By 2024, this allowance had decreased to $33 million, reflecting a reduction in expected credit losses. This change indicates that Tesla's credit risk exposure in its legacy MyPower loan program improved over time, likely due to better-than-anticipated repayment performance or a reduction in outstanding balances. The allowance for loan losses, which directly represents expected credit losses over the remaining life of the loans, was adjusted accordingly to reflect this improved outlook. This demonstrates a direct temporal relationship between Tesla's assessment of expected credit losses in 2023 and the evolution of its allowance for loan losses in 2024.",

Our accounts receivable balances associated with sales of energy storage products are dependent on billing milestones and payment terms negotiated for each contract, and our accounts receivable balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, government rebates receivable was $315 million and $378 million, respectively, in Accounts receivable, net for the current portion and an immaterial amount and $207 million, respectively, in Other non-current assets for the long-term portion in our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Financing Receivables\n\nWe provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the future cash flows. Interest income on financing receivables is recognized over the loan term as revenue in the consolidated statements of operations.\n\nWhen originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e.g., FICO score) and other information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant's ability to pay and creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have strong creditworthiness at loan origination.\n\nAfter origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we define 'past due' as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with an immaterial balance being past due. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2023 and 2022.\n\nWe have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of allowance for expected credit losses, was $248 million and $266 million, respectively, of which $4 million and $5 million were due in the nex t 12 months as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the allowance for expected credit losses was $33 million and $36 million, respectively.",

      "question": "How did Amazon's 2022 North America sales growth of 18% driven by unit sales translate into 2023 operating income performance, particularly in light of ongoing fulfillment network inefficiencies mentioned in both years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon's North America sales grew 18%, primarily driven by increased unit sales, which were partially offset by fulfillment network inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. The connection between North America sales and unit sales was explicitly stated as a key growth driver. In 2023, North America operating income improved from a loss in 2022 to a profit, with increased unit sales and advertising sales cited as primary contributors. However, this improvement was partially offset by increased shipping and fulfillment costs, which represent a continuation of the 2022 fulfillment network inefficiencies. The persistence of these challenges indicates that while unit sales growth successfully translated into improved operating income, the cost side remained pressured by the same fulfillment issues mentioned in both years.",

GM Financial's credit risk models incorporated economic indicators like disposable personal income, which directly influenced loan loss provisions. By 2023, GM continued to use disposable personal income as a key economic factor in forecasting credit losses for GM Financial's retail finance receivables, indicating a sustained but potentially recalibrated sensitivity to consumer financial health.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported $8.68 billion in commercial finance receivables, which grew to $13.8 billion by 2023. This significant increase in receivables, primarily variable-rate assets, likely shifted GM Financial's interest rate sensitivity profile. In 2021 (as reported in 2022 disclosures), GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning liabilities re-priced faster than assets, which could have been exacerbated by the increased receivables in 2023. To manage this risk, GM Financial employed hedging strategies under its global asset liability committee, aiming to balance the mismatch between rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and stabilize net interest income amidst fluctuating rates.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM Financial had the right to receive residual returns from VIE securitization activities that were potentially significant, indicating a positive financial inflow. However, by 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its SAIC-GMAC investment, which was tied to the same securitization framework. This shift from a potentially positive residual return structure in 2023 to a significant impairment in 2024 negatively impacted GM's overall financial performance, contributing to a broader context of $4.4 billion in equity losses from its China JVs. The evolution of this relationship shows a deterioration in the value of GM Financial's residual interests, likely due to declining market conditions and impaired asset values in China.",

Variable Interest E ntities\n\n## Consolidated VIEs\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nGM Financial uses special purpose entities (SPEs) that are considered VIEs to issue variable funding notes to third party, bank-sponsored warehouse facilities or asset-backed  securities  to  investors  in  securitization  transactions.  The  debt  issued  by  these  V IEs  is  backed  by  finance  receivables  and  leasing-related  assets transferred to the VIEs (Securitized Assets). GM Financial determined that it is the primary beneficiary of the SPEs because the servicing responsibilities for the Securitized Assets give GM Financial the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the performance of the VIEs and the variable interests in the VIEs give GM Financial the obligation to absorb losses and the right to receive residual returns that could potentially be significant. The assets of the VIEs serve as the sole source of repayment for the debt issued by these entities. Investors in the notes issued by the VIEs do not have recourse to GM Financial or its other assets, with the exception of customary representation and warranty repurchase provisions and indemnities that GM Financial provides as the servicer. GM Financial is not required to provide additional financial support to these SPEs. While these subsidiaries are included in GM Financial's consolidated financial statements, they are separate legal entities and their assets are legally owned by them and are not available to GM Financial's creditors or creditors of GM Financial's other subsidiaries.\n\nThe following table summarizes the assets and liabilities related to GM Financial's consolidated VIEs:\n\n",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How did Starbucks' shift in unallocated corporate expense composition from fiscal 2023 to 2024\u2014specifically increased investments in technology ($93M) and partner wages ($57M) versus reduced performance-based compensation ($61M)\u2014impact their ability to fund strategic initiatives like acquisitions and shareholder returns through their $3.0B credit facility?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Starbucks reported a Corporate and Other operating loss of $1.8 billion, which increased to $1.9 billion in fiscal 2024\u2014a $100 million rise. This increase was driven by new strategic investments: $93 million in technology and $57 million in partner wages and benefits. These were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($61 million) and the lapping of $30 million in donations to The Starbucks Foundation. Despite the higher operating loss, Starbucks maintained strong liquidity with $3.8 billion in cash and investments as of September 29, 2024, down from $4.2 billion in 2023. The company's $3.0 billion revolving credit facility remained undrawn in both years and was available to fund strategic priorities such as acquisitions and shareholder returns (e.g., dividends and buybacks). However, the reallocation of expenses suggests a strategic pivot toward long-term investments in workforce and technology, which may affect near-term free cash flow available for those other initiatives unless offset by improved operating performance.",

Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2024, or 5%, compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($93 million), investments in partner wages and benefits ($57 million), and certain proxy solicitation and advisory services costs incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 ($28 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($61 million) and the lapping of donations to The Starbucks Foundation made in fiscal 2023 ($30 million).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of September 29, 2024, approximately $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Borrowing Capacity\n\n## Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the '2021 credit facility'), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital ex penditures, and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\n\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's rating agencies. The 'Base Rate' is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\n\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of September 29, 2024, or October 1, 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported that $32.8 billion (64% of total retail finance receivables) came from borrowers with Prime FICO scores (680 and greater), indicating a strong emphasis on high-credit-quality borrowers. This segment significantly outweighed near-prime and sub-prime categories. By 2023, GM continued to rely on FICO scores as a key metric for assessing the credit risk of its retail finance receivables portfolio. Despite this, the allowance for loan losses remained stable at 2.7% of finance receivables in both years, suggesting that the credit quality of the portfolio, as influenced by the dominance of Prime FICO score borrowers, helped maintain consistent risk levels year-over-year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported charges related to international operations, including adjustments tied to recent Korea Supreme Court decisions affecting GMI salaried workers. These charges signaled early financial pressures in international markets. In 2023, Cruise, GM's autonomous vehicle subsidiary, recorded $529 million in charges\u2014partly due to restructuring\u2014including $250 million in non-cash charges, as it paused AV operations. By 2024, GM recorded $142 million in impairment charges for Cruise-related technology, reflecting the culmination of earlier restructuring efforts and strategic shifts. The 2022 international charges, 2023 Cruise restructuring, and 2024 impairment charges show a cascading financial impact across years tied to operational adjustments.",

We expect remaining cash outflows related to these activities of $719 million to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn April 2024, we announced restructuring actions in GMI related to the closure of manufacturing operations in Colombia and Ecuador. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $170 million before noncontrolling interest primarily related to employee separations and supplier-related charges of $88 million, which are included in the table above, and non-cash restructuring charges of $79 million primarily related to accelerated depreciation and amortization, which are not reflected in the table above. As of December 31, 2024, we have incurred $48 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $200 million, primarily in GMNA, related to employee separations.As of December 31, 2024, we have incurred $163 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring actions. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn March 2023, we announced a VSP to accelerate attrition related to the cost reduction program announced in January 2023. We recorded charges in GMNA of $1.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to employee separation charges of $905 million, which are reflected in the table above, and non-cash pension curtailment and settlement charges of approximately $130 million, not reflected in the table above. We incurred cash outflows of $58 million and $820 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. This program is complete as of December 31, 2024.\n\nIn October 2023, Cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual AV  operations in the U.S. while it ex amined its processes, systems and tools. In conjunction with these actions, Cruise recorded charges before noncontrolling interest of $529 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which included noncash restructuring charges of $250 million. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin and recognized primarily non-cash charges before noncontrolling interest of $631 million. In December 2024, in conjunction with GM's announcement of its decision to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and its plans, subject to approval by the Cruise Board of Directors, to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges before noncontrolling interest of $522 million, which included net non-cash restructuring charges of $173 million. The non-cash restructuring charges are not reflected in the table above. Cumulatively, we have incurred $287 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities of approximately $389 million to be completed by the end of 2025.\n\n## Note 19. Interest Income and Other Non-Operating Income\n\n",

However, by 2024, GMNA's fleet sales decreased to 615 thousand units from 679 thousand units in 2023, and fleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales dropped from 19.2% to 16.9%.

      "answer": "In 2022, GM disclosed that GM Financial faced risks such as charge-offs, delinquencies, and residual value performance that could impair its ability to provide competitive financing, directly impacting GM's vehicle sales (chunk 1). By 2024, GM Financial explicitly listed 'provision for loan losses' as a primary expense component (chunk 2), and the 2024 financial statements showed that GM Financial recognized this provision to account for expected loan losses over the remaining life of finance receivables (chunk 3). This indicates that GM's ongoing reliance on GM Financial for customer and dealer financing led to a more formalized and transparent risk management approach in 2024, with the provision for loan losses serving as a structured response to the credit risks identified in 2022.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How did Starbucks' tax exposure related to foreign subsidiaries evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to foreign withholding taxes and indefinite reinvestment strategies?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Starbucks noted that if cash held by foreign subsidiaries were repatriated, it could be subject to material foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. By 2024, Starbucks had partially indefinitely reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries, resulting in a gross tax able temporary difference of $2.6 billion, which could lead to up to $260 million in unrecognized tax liability. The shift indicates a strategic change in how Starbucks manages foreign earnings, balancing reinvestment with potential tax exposure. The 2022 filing by UPS provides context that distributions from foreign subsidiaries often trigger foreign withholding taxes, aligning with Starbucks' earlier stated concerns and later tax planning strategy.",

      "answer": "In 2023, SBUX's Goodwill Balance totaled $3,218.3 million, with the Corporate and Other Segment accounting for $1.0 million. By 2024, the total Goodwill Balance increased to $3,315.7 million, and the Corporate and Other Segment still held $1.0 million of that total. This suggests that while SBUX increased its overall goodwill, the Corporate and Other Segment's share remained unchanged, indicating a stable but minor role in the company's intangible asset portfolio.

This growth was partially driven by a $0.7 billion favorable variance linked to price improvements, which were directly tied to an increase in average selling price.

      "question": "How did the stability of Starbucks' goodwill allocation to the Channel Development segment from 2022 ($34.7M) to 2024 ($34.7M) reflect the company's strategic focus or lack thereof in that business unit, especially considering the significant fluctuations in goodwill for other segments like International?",
      "answer": "Starbucks maintained a consistent goodwill allocation of $34.7M to the Channel Development segment from 2022 to 2024, indicating a stable strategic positioning or valuation of this segment. In contrast, the International segment saw its goodwill balance decline from $2,756.7M in 2022 to $2,788.5M in 2024, with notable adjustments in between (-$65.6M in 2023 and +$97.4M in 2024), suggesting active portfolio management or impairment activity. The Channel Development segment's unchanged goodwill suggests it was not subject to major restructuring or revaluation during this period, potentially signaling confidence in its performance or a deliberate strategic choice to maintain its valuation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: SBUX(2022) \u2192 Goodwill Balance: Starbucks reported a goodwill balance of $34.7M allocated to the Channel Development segment in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Goodwill Balance \u2192 Channel Development Segment: The goodwill balance directly reflects the valuation or acquisition-related premium attributed to the Channel Development segment.",
        "Hop 3: Channel Development Segment \u2190 SBUX(2024): In 2024, Starbucks still reported the same $34.7M goodwill balance allocated to the Channel Development segment, showing no change over the two-year period."

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial contributed $11,712 million in U.S. Net Sales and Revenue and $1,702 million Non-U.S., totaling $13,414 million. By 2024, this increased to $13,575 million in U.S. and $2,261 million Non-U.S., totaling $15,836 million. This represents a growth of $2,422 million (18.05%) in GM Financial's total Net Sales and Revenue contribution over the two-year period. The increase indicates that GM Financial became a more significant contributor to GM\u2019s overall revenue performance, especially in the U.S. market where growth was $1,863 million (15.9%).

      "answer": "In 2022, Starbucks' corporate assets included significant cash reserves and roasting facilities that contributed to their tax asset base, with international markets like Japan, Canada, and the UK accounting for 74% of non-US/China revenues. By 2024, Starbucks refined their tax asset valuation methodology by emphasizing a three-year cumulative income analysis for deferred tax asset recoverability and explicitly addressing potential repatriation tax impacts on foreign earnings. The company also increased focus on jurisdiction-specific tax audits and valuation allowances, reflecting a more detailed approach to managing tax assets tied to their global operations.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax  assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax  rates ex pected to apply to tax able income in the years in which we ex pect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax  assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized.\n\nIn evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax  assets within the jurisdiction from which they arise, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future tax able income, tax -planning strategies, and results of operations. In projecting future tax able income, we consider historical results and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future state, federal, and foreign pre-tax operating income adjusted for items that do not have tax consequences. Our assumptions regarding future taxable income are consistent with the plans and estimates we use to manage our underlying businesses. In evaluating the objective evidence that historical results provide, we consider three years of cumulative operating income/(loss).\n\nIn addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include review of our tax  filing positions, such as the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income between tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax  position will be sustained upon ex amination by the relevant tax ing authorities, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of our position. The tax  benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For uncertain tax positions that do not meet this threshold, we record a related liability. We adjust our unrecognized tax  benefit liability and income tax  ex pense in the period in which the uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations ex pires for the relevant tax ing authority to ex amine the tax  position, or when new information becomes available. As discussed in Note 14, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, there is a reasonable possibility that our unrecognized tax benefit liability will be adjusted within 12 months due to the ex piration of a statute of limitations and/or resolution of examinations with taxing authorities.\n\nWe have generated income in certain foreign jurisdictions that may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. We regularly review our plans for reinvestment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The possibility exists that foreign earnings declared as indefinitely reinvested may be repatriated as our plans are based on our estimated working and other capital needs in jurisdictions where our earnings are generated. While we do not expect to repatriate cash to the U.S. to satisfy domestic liquidity needs, if these amounts were distributed to the U.S., in the form of dividends or otherwise, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes, which could be material.\n\nOur income tax expense and deferred tax assets and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management's best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid. Deferred tax  asset valuation allowances and our liabilities for unrecognized tax  benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax  audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. Although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable, actual results, including forecasted business performance, could differ, and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material.

      "answer": "In 2022, Nike's Global Brand Divisions contributed $102 million in other revenue, reflecting centrally managed product creation, design, and global digital operations. By 2024, the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes decreased by 2%, driven by lower operating overhead expenses, including wage-related costs and technology spend. However, this was partially offset by a rise in demand creation expenses, primarily due to increased advertising and marketing spend, including digital marketing. In fiscal 2024, this translated into a 2% increase in selling and administrative expenses, with demand creation rising due to higher advertising, marketing, and retail brand presentation expenses. This indicates that while Nike streamlined its operating structure to reduce overhead, it reallocated resources toward demand generation, particularly in digital channels, aligning with strategic efforts to drive brand engagement and revenue growth across key segments like footwear and apparel.",

      "answer": "In 2022, SBUX's Store Operating Expenses accounted for 38.9% of total net revenues, reflecting high costs associated with store operations. By 2024, Store Operating Expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased by 140 basis points, driven by wage and benefit investments and deleverage, but partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies (approximately 170 basis points). These efficiencies helped reduce the negative impact on operating margins, contributing approximately 100 basis points toward offsetting a 220 basis point contraction in international operating margin, which stood at 14.2% in 2024 compared to 12.0% in 2022. Thus, while operating expenses rose, in-store operational efficiencies played a critical role in mitigating margin pressure.",

      "question": "How did the $0.3 billion impairment charge related to GM's China operations in 2024 affect the composition and volatility of the 'Other' financial category, which in both years included foreign exchange impacts and non-vehicle related automotive revenues?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM categorized 'Other' as including foreign exchange, non-vehicle related automotive revenues, and equity income or loss from nonconsolidated affiliates. In 2024, GM recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its SAIC-GMAC investment in China, which fell under the same 'Other' category. This impairment charge significantly altered the composition of 'Other' by introducing a large one-time loss, potentially increasing the volatility of this category. While foreign exchange remained a consistent component across both years, the addition of this impairment charge in 2024 introduced a new source of fluctuation within 'Other,' distinct from FX movements.",

      "question": "How did the increase in SBUX's 2023 store operating expenses, driven by wage and benefit investments, relate to the 2024 in-store operational efficiencies that partially offset international operating margin contraction?",
      "answer": "In 2023, SBUX reported that store operating expenses increased by 140 basis points as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, primarily due to investments in store partner wages and benefits (170 basis points), deleverage (80 basis points), and increased promotional activity (70 basis points), despite partial offset from in-store operational efficiencies (170 basis points). By 2024, these operational efficiencies continued to play a role, contributing approximately 100 basis points toward offsetting a 220 basis point contraction in international operating margin driven by increased promotional activity and wage investments. This suggests that while wage investments increased costs in 2023, the company carried forward efficiency measures into 2024 to mitigate ongoing margin pressures.",

Also contributing to the decline in international total net revenues were lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees ($69 million), largely driven by continued disruptions due to multiple international conflicts, partially offset by the performance of 654 net new licensed store openings over the past 12 months. These decreases were partially offset by net new company-operated store growth of 10%, or 893 stores, over the past 12 months ($378 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nInternational operating income for fiscal 2024 decreased 15% to $1.0 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Operating margin contracted 220 basis points to 14.2%, primarily due to increased promotional activity (approximately 170 basis points) and investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies (approx imately 100 basis points).",

      "question": "How did the changes in GM's vehicle sales mix in 2023, particularly the decline in mid-size pickup trucks and passenger cars and the rise in full-size SUVs, influence the favorable Price impact on EBIT-adjusted in 2024, and how does this compare to the contributions from Volume and Cost improvements?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM experienced a shift in its vehicle sales mix, with decreased sales of mid-size pickup trucks and passenger cars and increased sales of full-size SUVs, which had a favorable Price impact. By 2024, this pricing dynamic contributed $0.7 billion to the EBIT-adjusted increase. However, the EBIT-adjusted growth of $2.2 billion from 2023 to 2024 was primarily driven by Volume ($3.9 billion favorable) and Cost improvements ($1.3 billion favorable), while Mix had an unfavorable impact of $3.1 billion. This suggests that while the favorable Price trend from 2023 continued into 2024, the overall EBIT-adjusted growth was more significantly influenced by higher sales volume and cost efficiencies, despite the ongoing mix shift challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM(2023) \u2192 Average Selling Price: GM saw a favorable Price impact due to increased full-size SUV sales and reduced mid-size pickup and passenger car sales.",
        "Hop 2: Average Selling Price \u2192 EBIT-adjusted: The favorable Price impact in 2023 contributed to a $0.7 billion positive variance in EBIT-adjusted in 2024.",
        "Hop 3: EBIT-adjusted \u2190 GM(2024): In 2024, EBIT-adjusted increased by $2.2 billion, with the Price impact being smaller than the contributions from Volume ($3.9 billion) and Cost ($1.3 billion)."

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.",

      "question": "How did GM's financial support through liquidity agreements with Cruise in 2023 relate to the restructuring charges recorded by Cruise in 2023 and the subsequent increase in non-cash charges and strategic changes in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM supported Cruise through liquidity agreements that allowed Cruise to defer up to $0.8 billion in engineering and capital spending, with $0.5 billion already deferred by year-end. This financial backing enabled Cruise to continue operations despite recording $529 million in restructuring charges, including $212 million in supplier-related charges and $250 million in non-cash restructuring charges tied to impairments. By 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin, leading to $631 million in primarily non-cash charges, and GM announced it would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development, resulting in an additional $522 million in charges. The financial support in 2023 directly enabled Cruise to absorb initial restructuring costs, but the lack of continued funding in 2024 led to deeper strategic shifts and larger non-cash impairments.",

As of December 31, 2024, we have incurred $48 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $200 million, primarily in GMNA, related to employee separations.As of December 31, 2024, we have incurred $163 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring actions. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn March 2023, we announced a VSP to accelerate attrition related to the cost reduction program announced in January 2023. We recorded charges in GMNA of $1.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to employee separation charges of $905 million, which are reflected in the table above, and non-cash pension curtailment and settlement charges of approximately $130 million, not reflected in the table above. We incurred cash outflows of $58 million and $820 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. This program is complete as of December 31, 2024.\n\nIn October 2023, Cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual AV  operations in the U.S. while it ex amined its processes, systems and tools. In conjunction with these actions, Cruise recorded charges before noncontrolling interest of $529 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which included noncash restructuring charges of $250 million. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin and recognized primarily non-cash charges before noncontrolling interest of $631 million. In December 2024, in conjunction with GM's announcement of its decision to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and its plans, subject to approval by the Cruise Board of Directors, to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges before noncontrolling interest of $522 million, which included net non-cash restructuring charges of $173 million. The non-cash restructuring charges are not reflected in the table above. Cumulatively, we have incurred $287 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities.

      "question": "How did the change in GM Financial's liquidity sources from 2022 to 2024, particularly its reliance on finance charge income, impact GM's recognition and reporting of this income in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial was identified as a critical segment for GM, with its ability to provide financing services directly impacting GM's vehicle sales. GM relied on GM Financial to offer leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to dealers, and any disruption in GM Financial\u2019s access to capital could have impaired this support. By 2024, GM Financial's liquidity sources were explicitly tied to finance charge income, among other streams, indicating a strategic emphasis on maintaining stable income from this source. GM's 2024 financial statements show that finance charge income was recognized using the effective interest method, with deferred fees and costs amortized over the loan term. This suggests that GM Financial's 2024 liquidity strategy was more tightly integrated with GM\u2019s financial reporting and risk management practices, reflecting a more structured and stable relationship between the two entities over time.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM(2022) \u2192 GM Financial: GM depended on GM Financial to provide leasing, financing, and commercial lending to support vehicle sales and dealer relationships, with risks around GM Financial\u2019s access to capital.",

Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of the transaction price.\n\nTypically,  transfers  to  daily  rental  companies  are  accounted  for  as  sales,  with  revenue  recognized  at  the  time  of  transfer.  We  defer  revenue  for  remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a liability for amounts ex pected to be paid once the remarketing services are complete at the time of sale and recognize deferred revenue in earnings upon completion of the remarketing service.\n\nUsed Vehicles Proceeds from the auction of vehicles utilized by our employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nServices and Other Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-sale services such as maintenance, OnStar, Super Cruise, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service arrangements that are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and recognized as deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services sold separately as services are performed, typically over a period of up to eight years.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial Finance  charge  income  earned  on  finance  receivables  is  recognized  using  the  effective  interest  method.  Fees  and commissions received (including manufacturer subvention) and direct costs of originating loans are deferred and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 60 days delinquent, accounts in bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has received payments bringing the delinquency to less than 60 days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 90 days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest.  Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received payments bringing the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including amounts previously charged off).\n\nIncome from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. G ains or losses realized upon disposition of off-lease assets including any payments received from lessees upon lease termination, are included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nAdvertising and Promotion E xpenditures Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $3.3 billion, $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nResearch and Development E xpenditures Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other cost of sales, were $9.2 billion, $9.9 billion and $9.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. These ex penditures include cost sharing payments and fees we receive when we enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design and development activities and use of intellectual property.\n\nCash  E quivalents  and  Restricted  Cash Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of 90 days or less.  Certain operating agreements require us to post cash as collateral. Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral. Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial entered into a multi-year $5.2 billion credit agreement with Cruise to fund the purchase of autonomous vehicles (AVs), indicating strong financial backing for Cruise's AV commercialization strategy. However, by 2024, GM recorded a $142 million impairment charge related to Cruise, specifically for the write-off of technology and intellectual property, signaling that the expected returns from this investment had deteriorated. This reflects a strategic shift or setback in GM\u2019s AV development efforts, despite the earlier capital commitment through GM Financial.

      "answer": "HD's ROIC declined from 44.6% in fiscal 2022 to 31.3% in fiscal 2024, a drop of 13.3 percentage points. During the same period, NOPAT decreased from $18,294 million in fiscal 2022 to $16,424 million in fiscal 2024, a reduction of $1,870 million. This decline in NOPAT, which is a key component of ROIC, contributed directly to the drop in ROIC. The relationship between NOPAT and ROIC is foundational, as ROIC is calculated by dividing NOPAT by average debt and equity. Therefore, the reduction in NOPAT indicates lower operating profitability, which, when combined with a growing capital base (average debt and equity rising from $41,055 million to $52,431), further diluted the ROIC, reflecting less efficient capital deployment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, NKE reported a total Selling and Administrative Expense of $14.8 billion, which was a significant increase from $13.0 billion in 2021. This increase was primarily driven by higher operating overhead and demand creation expenses, as outlined in the 2022 10-K filing. These expenses directly impacted the Global Brand Divisions, which saw their loss before interest and taxes increase by 17% in fiscal 2022 due to the higher costs. By 2023, the Global Brand Divisions contributed only $102 million in revenue, as seen in the 2023 10-K filing, indicating that despite continued high expenses, the divisions did not generate significant revenue, thus maintaining a weak financial performance.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla explicitly included 'sales of solar energy systems incentives' as part of its Energy Generation and Storage segment revenue, indicating that these incentives were a recognized and quantifiable component of the segment's financial performance. By 2023, Tesla continued to report the Energy Generation and Storage segment as a core operating unit, maintaining the same structural definition that includes solar incentives. However, despite this continuity, Tesla's 2023 10-K did not highlight any specific growth metrics or performance improvements in this segment compared to 2022, suggesting that the strategic emphasis may have remained on automotive growth rather than a significant pivot toward energy generation. The lack of detailed financial progression implies that while the segment remained intact and incentives were still part of its model, the segment's relative importance or growth trajectory did not materially shift year-over-year.",

Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported a Net Carrying Amount of $3,173 million for total intangible assets, which decreased to $2,941 million in 2023. This decline was driven by a reduction in the Net Carrying Amount of Brands from $2,746 million in 2022 to $2,526 million in 2023, as well as a drop in Dealer Network, Customer Relationships and Other from $218 million to $184 million. Despite an increase in the Net Carrying Amount of Technology and Intellectual Property from $209 million to $231 million, the overall Total Intangible Assets declined from $6,026 million in 2022 to $6,010 million in 2023.

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial used historical loss experience in combination with macroeconomic forecasts\u2014such as unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, and GDP growth\u2014to estimate credit losses for retail and commercial finance receivables. By 2024, GM had evolved its approach, directly applying historical loss data alongside forecasted auto industry conditions\u2014such as vehicle sales trends\u2014to shape its allowance for loan losses on automotive receivables. This shift indicates a more targeted and sector-specific methodology, reflecting a deeper integration of historical performance into forward-looking risk modeling for automotive credit exposure.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years.

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale.

      "answer": "GM's reliance on GM Financial remained a critical component of its financial performance between 2022 and 2024. In 2022, GM Financial reported $3,995M in finance charge income, which increased to $4,519M by 2024, indicating stronger performance in its financing arm. This growth in finance charge income suggests that GM Financial was able to expand its lending activities or improve yield on existing portfolios, despite broader economic and financial risks outlined in the 2022 filing, such as sensitivity to interest rates, delinquencies, and competition. The increase of $524M in finance charge income over two years reflects a positive trend that likely supported GM\u2019s broader sales and market penetration goals, as GM Financial plays a key role in facilitating customer and dealer financing.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How did GM's investment in Cruise in 2022 relate to the restructuring charges recorded in 2024, particularly in light of Cruise's decision to delay its robotaxi development and combine technical efforts with GM?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM invested $1.0 billion in Cruise through the purchase of Class G Preferred Shares, signaling strong commitment to autonomous vehicle development. However, by 2023\u20132024, Cruise faced operational setbacks, including a voluntary pause of all AV operations in October 2023, which led to $529 million in restructuring charges. This was followed by the indefinite delay of the Cruise Origin in June 2024, resulting in $631 million in charges, and culminated in December 2024 with GM's decision to stop funding Cruise's robotaxi development, triggering an additional $522 million in charges. These developments indicate that GM\u2019s initial investment in Cruise in 2022 evolved into significant restructuring costs by 2024 due to strategic pivots and operational challenges within Cruise.",
      "reasoning_steps": [

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\n\nGMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

This stability suggests that the company did not make any significant acquisitions or goodwill adjustments related to this segment during the period, indicating no major strategic shifts or financial revaluations.

      "answer": "The increase in dealer financing exposure from $10.6 billion in 2022 to $13.3 billion in 2023 likely shifted GM Financial's interest rate sensitivity profile. GM Financial manages interest rate risk through asset-liability management and hedging strategies, as noted in the 2022 filing, where they described being 'liability-sensitive' in 2021. With more dealer financing (which typically carries variable interest rates), GM Financial would have had greater exposure to interest rate fluctuations in 2023. This could have amplified the impact of rate changes on net interest income, especially given their liability-sensitive position in recent years, where rising rates would increase interest expenses more than interest income.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM reported that 12.8% of its retail finance receivables came from the near-prime segment (FICO 620-679). This segment sits between prime and sub-prime borrowers and carries moderate credit risk. By 2024, GM's allowance for loan losses as a percentage of finance receivables decreased slightly from 2.7% to 2.6%. This reduction in the loan loss allowance percentage, despite maintaining a significant near-prime exposure from the prior year, suggests that GM may have seen improved credit performance or lower delinquency rates among these borrowers. The relationship indicates a potential evolution in GM's credit risk profile, where the near-prime segment\u2014originally a substantial portion of their portfolio\u2014did not deteriorate as expected, allowing for a more optimistic loss reserve outlook in 2024.",

      "answer": "Starbucks' Channel Development segment maintained a stable goodwill balance of $34.7 million throughout 2022, indicating no significant impairment or additions in that year. This stability contrasts with the overall goodwill balance, which decreased from $3,283.5 million in 2022 to $3,218.3 million in 2023, suggesting that impairments or adjustments occurred in other segments, particularly in the International segment where goodwill dropped from $2,756.7 million to $2,691.1 million.

      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied heavily on GM Financial to provide competitive financing to customers and dealers, which was exposed to various risks including loan performance and charge-offs. By 2023, GM Financial disclosed an allowance for loan losses of $2.3 billion for its retail finance receivables, based on economic forecasts including unemployment rates and GDP growth. This allowance was sensitive to forecasted recovery rates, with a 5% decrease in recovery rates increasing the allowance by $0.1 billion. The increase in allowance suggests that GM Financial anticipated higher credit risk in 2023, which in turn indicates a higher risk exposure for GM's automotive financing operations compared to 2022.",

For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

This relationship between North America sales and advertising sales was positive and contributed to the overall sales momentum. By 2023, advertising sales had grown further, directly contributing to a turnaround in North America operating income\u2014from an operating loss in 2022 to a $12.2 billion operating income in 2023. The evolution shows that the earlier growth in advertising sales helped transition from top-line expansion to bottom-line profitability within the North America segment.",

For a discussion of the effect of foreign exchange rates on sales growth, see 'Effect of Foreign Exchange Rates' below.\n\nNorth America sales increased 18% in 2021, compared to the prior year.

      "answer": "In 2022, GM highlighted its reliance on GM Financial to provide leasing services and noted that fluctuations in residual value performance on leased vehicles could negatively impact GM's sales efforts. By 2024, GM Financial had implemented a process where residual values were periodically evaluated and adjusted downward or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), directly influencing depreciation costs. GM also reported in 2024 that residual value estimates were based on forecasted auction proceeds and market conditions, and any significant deviation in actual outcomes could require adjustments to asset valuations. This shows that GM's ability to manage lease asset valuations in 2024 was directly tied to GM Financial's evolving residual value performance and forecasting capabilities over the two-year period.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales Incentives The estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by approximately $0.4 billion. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses ex pected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a weighted-average remaining life of approximately two years. GM Financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the U.S. retail finance receivables portfolio of $2.1 billion. If the forecast economic conditions were based entirely on the weakest scenario considered, the allowance for loan losses would increase by $0.2 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of financing products for dealers and other businesses. GM Financial provides commercial lending  products  to  its  dealer  customers  that  include  floorplan  financing,  also  known  as  wholesale  or  inventory  financing,  which  is  lending  to  finance  vehicle inventory. GM Financial also provides dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Additionally, GM Financial provides lending products to commercial vehicle upfitters and advances to certain of our subsidiaries. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry conditions. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nValuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and Residuals GM Financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases. Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At the inception of a lease, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from one to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices.\n\nDuring the term of a lease, GM Financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward, which increases the prospective depreciation, or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), which decreases the prospective depreciation.",

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. V arious factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Noncredit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of ex it prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  Net realizable value is the estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  cost  to  sell,  and  considers  general  market  and  economic  conditions,  periodic  reviews  of  current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Inventories are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete, with a primary focus on productive material, supplies, work in process and parts and accessories.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of typically two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is  evaluated  over  the  life  of  the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes.",

      "question": "How did the composition of GM's commercial finance receivables in 2022 relate to the impairment charges recorded by GM Financial in 2024, particularly in light of GM's evolving exposure to risk-rated dealer financing?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM disclosed that its commercial finance receivables totaled $8.68 billion, with $7.66 billion originated in 2022 alone, indicating a growing portfolio of dealer financings managed through GM Financial. GM Financial used a proprietary risk rating system to manage these receivables, which were primarily for dealer inventory purchases. By 2024, despite these controls, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its investment in SAIC-GMAC, a joint venture tied to its commercial finance activities in China. This suggests that the risk profile of GM Financial's commercial receivables, particularly in international markets, deteriorated significantly between 2022 and 2024, leading to a material financial impact. The impairment reflects a shift from a largely stable and risk-managed receivables portfolio in 2022 to a more stressed asset base by 2024, particularly in international joint ventures.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How did Tesla's $1.78 billion in solar energy systems incentives reported in 2022 relate to the 32% year-over-year growth in its energy generation and storage revenue to $4.75 billion in 2023, and what does this suggest about the segment's evolving revenue drivers?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla reported $1.78 billion in solar energy systems incentives, which were a core component of its energy generation and storage revenue. This segment grew by 32% year-over-year to reach $4.75 billion in 2023, indicating that incentives continued to play a foundational role in revenue generation. However, the significant growth suggests that Tesla likely expanded beyond incentives into broader product offerings such as solar installations and energy storage solutions. The consistent inclusion of 'sales of solar energy systems incentives' in the segment\u2019s description across both years confirms its ongoing strategic importance, while the outsized growth implies increasing market adoption and operational scaling in the clean energy space.",

Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",

By 2024, GM's total Net Sales and Revenue increased to $187.442 billion, while GMFinancial's U.S. revenue grew to $13.575 billion. This indicates a parallel increase in both GM's overall revenue and its financial services segment's performance, suggesting a strengthening strategic alignment between GM's automotive operations and GMFinancial.

By 2024, production costs had a favorable impact of $1.3 billion on EBIT-adjusted, which rose to $14,528 million with a margin of 9.2%. This indicates that GM improved its cost management effectiveness, turning a cost-related drag into a positive contributor to profitability over the two-year period.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied heavily on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services to customers and dealers, with GM Financial's performance being sensitive to economic conditions such as unemployment rates. GM Financial incorporated unemployment forecasts into its modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables. By 2023, GM Financial continued to use unemployment rates as a key economic factor in forecasting expected credit losses, but with updated forecasts reflecting the evolving economic environment. This led to adjustments in the allowance for loan losses, as GM Financial supplemented its static pool modeling with management judgment to account for changes in regional economic conditions, including variations in unemployment trends. The allowance was adjusted to maintain adequate coverage over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM invested $1.0 billion in Cruise through the issuance of Class G Preferred Shares, which accelerated Cruise's development activities and led to a significant modification of its RSU program in March 2022. This modification caused 31 million RSUs to vest immediately, resulting in a spike in compensation expense for Cruise Holdings to $1.6 billion in 2022. By 2023, this investment and earlier compensation decisions had a carryover effect, as the total unrecognized compensation expense for nonvested Cruise share-based awards stood at $0.7 billion at the end of 2023, expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. This shows that GM\u2019s earlier capital injection into Cruise directly contributed to the magnitude of future compensation obligations reflected in 2023.",

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\n\nGMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM supported Cruise with up to $3.4 billion in a multi-year credit agreement and $0.8 billion in deferred invoice payments for engineering and capital spending, with Cruise having already borrowed $0.3 billion and deferred $0.5 billion by year-end. However, by 2024, Cruise recorded $529 million in restructuring charges tied to the pause in its AV operations, followed by $631 million in non-cash charges from delaying the Cruise Origin and $522 million in net charges after GM decided to stop funding Cruise's robotaxi development and instead merge Cruise's technical efforts with GM's. This shows a clear shift from financial backing and investment in 2023 to strategic retreat and restructuring in 2024, resulting in significant financial charges.",

      "question": "How did Nike's 2022 EBIT reporting approach, which excluded foreign exchange effects, relate to the $68 million unfavorable impact from foreign currency fluctuations on Net Earnings in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Nike reported EBIT as its primary performance metric, explicitly excluding foreign exchange impacts from segment results, with those effects instead consolidated into the Corporate segment (chunk_1). This approach insulated EBIT from FX volatility by design, as currency gains and losses were managed centrally. However, by 2024, despite Nike\u2019s hedging strategies, foreign exchange fluctuations still had a measurable impact on Net Earnings\u2014resulting in a $68 million unfavorable effect year-over-year (chunk_3). This demonstrates that while EBIT was structured to exclude FX volatility, the broader financial performance metric of Net Earnings remained exposed to currency translation risks, which ultimately affected consolidated earnings despite central risk management (chunk_2 confirms EBIT is pre-interest and pre-tax, making it a precursor to Net Earnings).",

Global Brand Divisions costs represent demand creation and operating overhead expense that include product creation and design expenses centrally managed for the NIKE Brand, as well as costs associated with NIKE Direct global digital operations and enterprise technology.\n\nCorporate consists primarily of unallocated general and administrative expenses, including expenses associated with centrally managed departments; depreciation and amortization related to the Company's headquarters; unallocated insurance, benefit and compensation programs, including stock-based compensation; and certain foreign currency gains and losses, including certain hedge gains and losses. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2020, Corporate included a non-recurring impairment charge, recognized as a result of the Company's decision to transition certain NIKE Brand businesses within APLA to a third-party distributor. This charge primarily reflected the anticipated release of associated non-cash cumulative foreign currency translation losses. For more information regarding this charge, refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures.\n\nThe primary financial measure used by the Company to evaluate performance of individual operating segments is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT), which represents Net income before Interest expense (income), net and Income tax expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n\nAs part of the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program, standard foreign currency rates are assigned twice per year to each NIKE Brand entity in the Company's geographic operating segments and to Converse. These rates are set approximately nine and twelve months in advance of the future selling seasons to which they relate (specifically, for each currency, one standard rate applies to the fall and holiday selling seasons, and one standard rate applies to the spring and summer selling seasons) based on average market spot rates in the calendar month preceding the date they are established. Inventories and Cost of sales for geographic operating segments and Converse reflect the use of these standard rates to record non-functional currency product purchases in the entity's functional currency. Differences between assigned standard foreign currency rates and actual market rates are included in Corporate, together with foreign currency hedge gains and losses generated from the Company's centrally managed foreign exchange risk management program and other conversion gains and losses.\n\nAccounts receivable, net, Inventories and Property, plant and equipment, net for operating segments are regularly reviewed by management and are therefore provided below.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 87",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM stated that it had sufficient liquidity to meet its requirements, including through access to capital markets and credit facilities, which supported GM Financial's ability to pay $3.5 billion in dividends. GM Financial had no borrowings from GM\u2019s revolving credit facilities and maintained intercompany loan balances that were relatively stable. By 2024, however, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment due to the challenging market conditions in China, which likely constrained its financial flexibility and dividend capacity. This reflects a shift from a supportive liquidity environment in 2022 to a more strained financial position in 2024, where impairment charges directly impacted GM Financial\u2019s ability to sustain prior levels of capital return.",

Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2021. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\n\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed  securities.  Our  investment  guidelines,  which  we  may  change  from  time  to  time,  prescribe  certain  minimum  credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the total size of our credit facilities was $18.5 billion, which consisted principally of four revolving credit facilities. In April 2021, we increased the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $10.5 billion facility to $11.2 billion and extended the termination date for a $9.9 billion portion of the five-year facility by three years, now set to mature on April 18, 2026. The termination date of April 18, 2023 for the remaining portion of the five-year facility remains unchanged. We also renewed and increased the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.0 billion facility to $4.3 billion, which now matures on April 7, 2024, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use by GM Financial, which now matures on April 6, 2022. We also terminated a separate 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into in May 2020. Additionally, the prior restrictions on share repurchases and dividends on our common shares were removed upon entrance into the renewed three-year, $4.3 billion facility. In December 2021, we terminated our three-year, $2.0 billion transformation credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the total size of our credit facilities was $15.5 billion, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities.\n\nIf available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2021 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.\n\nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $3.5 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.4 billion on its common stock in  2021,  2020,  and  2019.  Current  dividend  levels  are  reflective  of  GM  Financial  earnings  supported  by  strong  residual  values, favorable  credit  performance  and  improved  economic  conditions.

SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated.

We expect remaining cash outflows related to these activities of $719 million to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn April 2024, we announced restructuring actions in GMI related to the closure of manufacturing operations in Colombia and Ecuador. In the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded $170 million before noncontrolling interest primarily related to employee separations and supplier-related charges of $88 million, which are included in the table above, and non-cash restructuring charges of $79 million primarily related to accelerated depreciation and amortization, which are not reflected in the table above. As of December 31, 2024, we have incurred $48 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $200 million, primarily in GMNA, related to employee separations.As of December 31, 2024, we have incurred $163 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring actions. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn March 2023, we announced a VSP to accelerate attrition related to the cost reduction program announced in January 2023. We recorded charges in GMNA of $1.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to employee separation charges of $905 million, which are reflected in the table above, and non-cash pension curtailment and settlement charges of approximately $130 million, not reflected in the table above. We incurred cash outflows of $58 million and $820 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. This program is complete as of December 31, 2024.\n\nIn October 2023, Cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual AV  operations in the U.S. while it ex amined its processes, systems and tools. In conjunction with these actions, Cruise recorded charges before noncontrolling interest of $529 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which included noncash restructuring charges of $250 million. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin and recognized primarily non-cash charges before noncontrolling interest of $631 million. In December 2024, in conjunction with GM's announcement of its decision to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and its plans, subject to approval by the Cruise Board of Directors, to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges before noncontrolling interest of $522 million, which included net non-cash restructuring charges of $173 million. The non-cash restructuring charges are not reflected in the table above. Cumulatively, we have incurred $287 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities.

      "question": "How did the increase in GM's commercial finance receivables from 2023 to 2024 impact GM Financial's finance charge income, given the role of dealer cash management balances in reducing interest payments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GM Financial reported $6,204 million in finance charge income, which was supported by $13.3 billion in dealer financing receivables, partially offset by $2.6 billion in dealer cash management balances that reduced interest payments. By 2024, dealer financing receivables increased to $14.2 billion, while dealer cash management balances also rose to $2.7 billion. Despite the larger reduction in interest due to higher cash management balances, GM Financial's finance charge income decreased to $4,521 million in 2024. This suggests that the growth in receivables did not translate into proportional growth in finance charge income, potentially due to lower effective interest rates, higher credit risk, or a shift in the composition of financing products.",

        "Hop 1: GM(2023) \u2192 GM Financial: GM's financial services segment, GM Financial, held $13.3 billion in dealer financing receivables in 2023, offset by $2.6 billion in dealer cash management balances.",

      "question": "How did the change in GM's Net Sales and Revenue from 2022 to 2024 influence the magnitude and direction of Eliminations, and what does this reveal about internal intersegment activity or restructuring efforts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported total consolidated Net Sales and Revenue of $127.0 billion, which increased significantly to $187.4 billion in 2024. However, the Eliminations component, which reduces total revenue to arrive at consolidated net sales, grew from an unspecified baseline in 2022 (implied by structure) to $296 million in 2024 \u2014 a 96% year-over-year increase compared to 2023's $151 million. This sharp rise in Eliminations suggests a growing amount of intercompany transactions being removed from consolidated figures, potentially indicating increased internal restructuring, expanded intersegment collaboration, or consolidation of overlapping business units. The 9.1% overall revenue growth from 2023 to 2024 contrasts with the much faster growth in Eliminations, signaling that internal activity may be expanding faster than external sales.",

        "Hop 3: Eliminations \u2190 GM(2024): GM's 2024 financials show Eliminations decreasing by $9 million to $3 million in cost of sales, indicating a more complex interplay between internal and external financial reporting"

      "answer": "In 2022, Amazon's unit sales growth was a key offsetting factor against rising fulfillment costs, with increased unit sales\u2014including those by third-party sellers\u2014helping to mitigate operating income pressures in North America. By 2024, this relationship had evolved such that the 10% increase in North America sales was explicitly attributed to higher unit sales, advertising, and subscription services, with third-party seller activity continuing to play a central role. The sustained emphasis on price, selection, and fast shipping in 2024 further amplified the impact of unit sales on regional sales performance, demonstrating a clear and deepened causal link between unit sales growth and North America revenue expansion over the two-year period.",

Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

      "answer": "Nike's Global Brand Divisions reported a 2% decrease in pre-tax loss from 2023 to 2024, which was primarily attributed to lower operating overhead expense in 2024. Specifically, this reduction in operating overhead was driven by lower wage-related expenses and technology spending, as disclosed in the 2024 10-K filing. Despite this, the benefit was partially offset by an increase in demand creation expenses, largely due to higher advertising and digital marketing costs. This evolution demonstrates a strategic shift to reduce certain fixed costs while increasing investments in demand generation activities.",

Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net R evenues is recorded in the period in which such determ ination is m ade.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales consists prim arily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in C ost of sales.\n\n## DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE\n\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and prom otion costs, including costs of endorsem ent contracts, com plim entary products, television, digital and print advertising as well as m edia costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first tim e an advertisem ent is run. Advertising m edia costs are expensed when the advertisem ent appears. C osts related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. C osts related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is com plete and delivered.\n\nA significant am ount of the C om pany's prom otional expenses result from  paym ents under endorsem ent contracts. In general, endorsem ent paym ents are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term  of the contract. H owever, certain contracts contain elem ents that m ay be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circum stances of each individual contract. P repaym ents m ade under contracts are included in P repaid expenses and other current assets or D eferred incom e taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applies.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent paym ents to endorsers based upon specific achievem ents in their sport (e.g., winning a cham pionship). T he C om pany records D em and creation expense for these am ounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable paym ents based upon endorsers m aintaining a level of perform ance in their sport over an extended period of tim e (e.g., m aintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). W hen the C om pany determ ines paym ents are probable, the am ounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the C om pany's best estim ate of the endorser's perform ance. In these instances, to the extent actual paym ents to the endorser differ from  the C om pany's estim ate due to changes in the endorser's perform ance, adjustm ents to D em and creation expense m ay be recorded in a future period.\n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty paym ents to endorsers based upon a predeterm ined percent of sales of particular products, which the C om pany records in C ost of sales as the related sales occur. F or contracts containing m inim um  guaranteed royalty paym ents, the C om pany records the am ount of any guaranteed paym ent in excess of that earned through sales of product within D em and creation expense.\n\nThrough cooperative advertising program s, the C om pany reim burses its wholesale custom ers for certain costs of advertising the C om pany's products. T o the extent the C om pany receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the custom er that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the am ounts reim bursed are recorded in D em and creation expense.\n\nTotal D em and creation expense was $4,285 m illion, $4,060 m illion and $3,850 m illion for the years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. P repaid advertising and prom otion expenses totaled $814 m illion and $755 m illion at M ay 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which $420 m illion and $372 m illion, respectively, were recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets, and $394 m illion and $383 m illion, respectively, were recorded in D eferred incom e taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applied.\n\n## OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE\n\nOperating overhead expense consists prim arily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and developm ent costs, bad debt expense as well as other adm inistrative expenses such as rent, depreciation and am ortization, professional services, certain technology investm ents, m eetings and travel.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 64",

      "answer": "GMNA fleet sales decreased from 493 (in thousands) in 2020 to 399 in 2021, reflecting a challenging market environment. However, by 2024, GMNA fleet sales rebounded significantly to 615, surpassing the 2020 level. This turnaround indicates a strategic shift or recovery in GM's fleet market positioning, especially as fleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales increased from 12.4% in 2020 to 16.9% in 2024, suggesting a stronger emphasis on fleet sales as part of the company's broader sales strategy.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, wage-related expenses rose significantly, contributing to a 17% increase in the loss before interest and taxes in the Global Brand Divisions, driven by higher operating overhead and demand creation expenses. This reflects increased investment in areas like digital capabilities and centralized brand operations. In fiscal 2023, the Global Brand Divisions contributed $102 million in revenue, a relatively small portion of total Nike Brand revenues, suggesting limited improvement or a continued strategic investment phase. The persistence of elevated wage costs from 2022 likely constrained the division\u2019s ability to generate meaningful profitability or revenue growth by 2023.",

NIKE Direct revenues increased 15%, primarily due to comparable store sales growth of 30% due to improved physical retail traffic, in part resulting from temporary store closures and safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 in the prior year, as well as digital sales growth of 8%.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in the Jordan Brand and Men's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 10 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues increased 16% due primarily to higher revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel increased 9%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 7 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nReported EBIT increased 35% as gross margin expansion and higher revenues more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 570 basis points primarily due to higher NIKE Direct margins, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, a higher mix of full-price sales and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, partially offset by higher product costs. Higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, was largely due to strategic pricing actions, while higher product costs were primarily due to increased freight and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was driven by higher advertising and marketing expense. Higher operating overhead expense was primarily due to increases in wage-related expenses and professional services.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 38",

      "question": "How has the relationship between GM's equity income contributions and its adjusted EBIT performance evolved from 2022 to 2024, and what does this trajectory indicate about the company's strategic reliance on joint venture profitability?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported equity income of $674 million, which was explicitly noted as a contributor to EBIT-adjusted performance in the 2022 filing. By 2024, GM projected EBIT-adjusted to be between $13.7 billion and $15.7 billion, indicating a significant upward trajectory in core earnings. This suggests that while equity income from joint ventures like those in China remained a component of profitability, GM's strategic focus appears to have shifted toward strengthening its core vehicle portfolio, particularly high-margin full-size pickup trucks and SUVs, as a primary driver of adjusted EBIT growth.",

        "Hop 1: GM(2022) \u2192 Equity Income: GM reported $674 million in equity income in 2022, which included contributions from joint ventures.",

        "Hop 3: Adjusted EBIT \u2190 GM(2024): GM projected EBIT-adjusted of $13.7\u201315.7 billion in 2024, showing a substantial increase from 2022 levels, with emphasis on core product profitability."

      "question": "How did Tesla's revenue strategy around Solar Energy Systems Incentives in 2022 relate to the growth and cost structure evolution of its Energy Generation and Storage segment by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Tesla explicitly included 'sales of solar energy systems incentives' as part of its Energy Generation and Storage segment revenue, indicating that these incentives were a deliberate component of their financial model for that segment. By 2024, Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment showed a clear cost structure evolution, with depreciation and amortization costs increasing from $331 million in 2022 to $377 million in 2024. This suggests that Tesla likely leveraged those earlier solar incentives to scale infrastructure and operations, which then contributed to higher depreciation costs in the later period. The inclusion of incentives in 2022 and the subsequent rise in cost metrics by 2024 reflect a strategic progression where short-term financial benefits from incentives supported longer-term capital investments in the segment.",

Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied heavily on GM Financial to estimate residual values for leased vehicles, which were based on third-party data and assumptions about future used vehicle prices and market conditions. GM Financial estimated a total residual value of $29.1 billion as of December 31, 2021, with adjustments made to reflect higher-than-expected used vehicle prices at lease terminations. By 2024, the residual value for crossovers had increased from $12,830 million to $13,184 million, while trucks saw a rise from $6,793 million to $7,458 million. This indicates that residual values generally outperformed earlier estimates, supporting GM's vehicle financing strategy and potentially reducing depreciation expenses for GM Financial.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, Full-Price ASP increased due to strategic pricing actions and a reduced discounting strategy, which contributed to gross margin expansion of 220 basis points. By 2024, this trend continued, with higher NIKE Brand full-price ASP (net of discounts) on a wholesale equivalent basis increasing gross margin by approximately 200 basis points, driven by the same strategic pricing discipline. This shows that the pricing strategy initiated in 2023 had a cascading positive impact on the NIKE Brand\u2019s profitability in 2024, despite challenges in other areas like digital sales and off-price margins.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of the transaction price.\n\nTypically,  transfers  to  daily  rental  companies  are  accounted  for  as  sales,  with  revenue  recognized  at  the  time  of  transfer.  We  defer  revenue  for  remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a liability for amounts ex pected to be paid once the remarketing services are complete at the time of sale and recognize deferred revenue in earnings upon completion of the remarketing service.\n\nUsed Vehicles Proceeds from the auction of vehicles utilized by our employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nServices and Other Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-sale services such as maintenance, OnStar, Super Cruise, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service arrangements that are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and recognized as deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services sold separately as services are performed, typically over a period of up to eight years.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial Finance  charge  income  earned  on  finance  receivables  is  recognized  using  the  effective  interest  method.  Fees  and commissions received (including manufacturer subvention) and direct costs of originating loans are deferred and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 60 days delinquent, accounts in bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has received payments bringing the delinquency to less than 60 days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 90 days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest.  Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received payments bringing the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including amounts previously charged off).\n\nIncome from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. G ains or losses realized upon disposition of off-lease assets including any payments received from lessees upon lease termination, are included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nAdvertising and Promotion E xpenditures Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $3.3 billion, $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nResearch and Development E xpenditures Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other cost of sales, were $9.2 billion, $9.9 billion and $9.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. These ex penditures include cost sharing payments and fees we receive when we enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design and development activities and use of intellectual property.\n\nCash  E quivalents  and  Restricted  Cash Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of 90 days or less.  Certain operating agreements require us to post cash as collateral. Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral. Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, NIKE Brand was a core segment of NKE's business, with revenue generation tied to both wholesale and direct-to-consumer channels. By fiscal 2024, strategic pricing actions led to a higher full-price ASP, which increased gross margin by approximately 200 basis points. This pricing strategy helped offset a 7% decrease in footwear unit sales, contributing approximately 5 percentage points of footwear revenue growth.

          "chunk_text": "## NOTE 1 - SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS\n\nNIKE, Inc. is a worldwide leader in the design, development and worldwide marketing and selling of athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services. NIKE, Inc. portfolio brands include the NIKE Brand, Jordan Brand, Hurley, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, and Converse. The NIKE Brand is focused on performance athletic footwear, apparel, equipment, accessories and services across Men's, Women's and Kids', amplified with sport-inspired lifestyle products carrying the Swoosh trademark, as well as other NIKE Brand trademarks. The Jordan Brand is focused on athletic and casual footwear, apparel and accessories using the Jumpman trademark. Sales and operating results of Jordan Brand products are reported within the respective NIKE Brand geographic operating segments. Sales and operating results of Hurley brand products, prior to its divestiture in fiscal 2020, were reported within the NIKE Brand's North America geographic operating segment. Refer to Note 20 - Acquisitions and Divestitures for information regarding the divestiture of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiary, Hurley. Converse designs, distributes, licenses and sells casual sneakers, apparel and accessories under the Converse, Chuck Taylor, All Star, One Star, Star Chevron and Jack Purcell trademarks. In some markets outside the U.S., these trademarks are licensed to third parties who design, distribute, market and sell similar products. Operating results of the Converse brand are reported on a stand-alone basis.\n\n## BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION\n\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of NIKE, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the \"Company\" or \"NIKE\"). All significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n\nEconomic sanctions imposed on Russia during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, impacted the Company's local business and a reduction in the Ruble liquidity affected the Company's ability to manage operational impact and related foreign currency risk. As a result, the Company deconsolidated its Russian legal entities, which resulted in a one-time, pre-tax charge of $96 million recognized within Other (income) expense, net, classified within Corporate. Subsequent to the end of fiscal 2022, the Company made the decision to leave the Russian marketplace.\n\n## REVENUE RECOGNITION\n\nRevenue transactions associated with the sale of NIKE Brand footwear, apparel and equipment, as well as Converse products, comprise a single performance obligation, which consists of the sale of products to customers either through wholesale or direct to consumer channels. The Company satisfies the performance obligation and records revenues when transfer of control to the customer has occurred, based on the terms of sale. A customer is considered to have control once they are able to direct the use and receive substantially all of the benefits of the product.\n\nControl is transferred to wholesale customers upon shipment or upon receipt depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer. Control transfers to retail store customers at the time of sale and to substantially all digital commerce customers upon shipment. The transaction price is determined based upon the invoiced sales price, less anticipated sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. Payment terms for wholesale transactions depend on the country of sale or agreement with the customer and payment is generally required within 90 days or less of shipment to or receipt by the wholesale customer. Payment is due at the time of sale for retail store and digital commerce transactions.\n\nConsideration for trademark licensing contracts is earned through sales-based or usage-based royalty arrangements, and the associated revenues are recognized over the license period.\n\nTaxes assessed by governmental authorities that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, and are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from Revenues and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as fulfillment costs and are included in Cost of sales when the related revenues are recognized.\n\n## SALES-RELATED RESERVES\n\nConsideration promised in the Company's contracts with customers is variable due to anticipated reductions, such as sales returns, discounts and miscellaneous claims from customers. The Company estimates the most likely amount it will be entitled to receive and records an anticipated reduction against Revenues, with an offsetting increase to Accrued liabilities at the time revenues are recognized. The estimated cost of inventory for product returns is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 62",

      "question": "How did the $4.1 billion in finance charge income reported by GM Financial in 2022 relate to the $0.3 billion impairment charge recorded against GM Financial's SAIC-GMAC investment in 2024, and what does this indicate about the changing risk profile of GM Financial's international investments over this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial reported $4.1 billion in finance charge income, reflecting its core role in generating revenue through financing activities, particularly through retail and commercial finance receivables. By 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment, indicating a deterioration in the value of its international financial services portfolio. This shift suggests that GM Financial's exposure to international markets, particularly in China, faced increasing risks due to market saturation, regulatory pressures, and economic headwinds. The connection between finance charge income and investment impairments reveals a broader risk dynamic: while GM Financial was generating strong returns through lending in 2022, by 2024, the underlying credit quality and market conditions of its international investments had weakened, leading to valuation write-downs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nin  active  markets,  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  instruments  in  markets  that  are  not  active  and  model-derived  valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable  Debt  Securities We  generally  classify  marketable  debt  securities  as  available-for-sale.  Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How did Starbucks' identifiable asset allocation to Technologies change from fiscal 2022 to 2023, and how does this align with their stated emphasis on deploying technologies to support global workforce development and training programs?",
      "answer": "Starbucks' identifiable asset allocation to Technologies decreased slightly from $19,700 million in fiscal 2022 to $19,534 million in fiscal 2023. Despite this small reduction, the company continued to emphasize the 'deployment of technologies' in training programs for partners globally, as noted in their 2023 annual report. This suggests that while there was a marginal decline in asset allocation, Starbucks maintained its strategic focus on leveraging technology to enhance workforce development and deliver the Starbucks Experience consistently across markets. The slight decrease does not appear to reflect a strategic shift away from technology investments, but rather a minor reallocation within a broader, ongoing commitment to tech-enabled workforce support.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM Financial estimated a $2.3 billion allowance for loan losses on its retail finance receivables, based on economic forecasts and recovery rate assumptions, with a $0.1 billion sensitivity to a 5% decrease in recovery rates. However, by 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment on its SAIC-GMAC investment, indicating that actual credit losses exceeded earlier forecasts. This suggests that despite incorporating economic outlooks into its allowance estimates, GM Financial underestimated the severity of credit risk, particularly in its international joint ventures. The evolution from a forecast-based allowance in 2023 to a realized impairment in 2024 reflects a gap in risk modeling, especially concerning external economic pressures and regional market deterioration.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

      "answer": "Starbucks held $2.7 billion in cash and short-term investments in foreign subsidiaries as of October 2, 2022. While the filings do not explicitly state the company\u2019s repatriation strategy for these funds, the 2024 filing notes that the effective tax rate increased by approximately 60 basis points due to accruals for foreign withholding taxes on current year earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries. This suggests that Starbucks either repatriated earnings from these foreign subsidiaries in 2024 or reevaluated the indefinite reinvestment assertion made in prior years, triggering the need to accrue withholding taxes. The connection between the 2022 foreign cash balances and the 2024 tax accrual implies a shift in how Starbucks is managing or planning for the taxation of international earnings, though the exact nature of the change is not fully disclosed.",

Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, we sold our Evolution Fresh brand and business.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.5 billion for fiscal 2022, or 7%, compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2021. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($84 million), increased support costs to address labor market conditions ($36 million) and increased partner wages and benefits ($31 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($62 million).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $3.5 billion and $6.9 billion as of October 2, 2022 and October 3, 2021, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, make acquisitions and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign) and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of October 2, 2022, approximately $2.7 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Borrowing capacity\n\n## Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\nOur total contractual borrowing capacity for general corporate purposes was $2.8 billion as of the end of fiscal 2022.\n\n## Revolving Lines of Credit\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured 5-year revolving credit facility (the '2021 credit facility'), of which $150 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion. Borrowings under the credit facility will bear interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's rating agencies. The 2021 credit facility contains alternative interest rate provisions specifying rate calculations to be used at such time LIBOR ceases to be available as a benchmark due to reference rate reform. The 'Base Rate' of interest is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate, and (iii) the Eurocurrency Rate (as defined in the credit facility) plus 1.000%. As of October 2, 2022, we had no borrowings under the 2021 credit facility.\n\n## Commercial Paper\n\nUnder our commercial paper program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $3.0 billion, with individual maturities that may vary but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. Amounts outstanding under the commercial paper program are required to be backstopped by available commitments under the",

These factors are impacting our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. We are in the late stages of finalizing details with our JV  partners on an agreement regarding certain restructuring actions, which include plant closures and portfolio optimization to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions, and updated business forecasts.\n\nBased on the updated forecast, we determined that the material loss in value of our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), SAIC GM (Shenyang) Norsom Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM Norsom), SAIC GM Dong Y ue Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM DY) and SAIC GM Dong Y ue Powertrain Co., Ltd. (SGM DYPT) was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024 which is included in equity income (loss). Our Automotive China JV s' equity losses also includes non-cash charges of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of the restructuring plan. We expect additional restructuring charges are likely to be incurred in 2025. G oing forward, we will continue to assess our strategy in the Chinese market to maintain presence while prioritizing profitability. In addition, G M Financial also concluded that a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC) existed. Refer to the \"Automotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook' section of this MD&amp;A for discussion of GM Financial's other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 25.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.9 million units for a market share of 3.7% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nCruise Cruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV  technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed development work on the Cruise Origin and recorded restructuring charges of $0.6 billion primarily related to noncash write-offs of Origin assets. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. Refer to Part I, Item 1. Business for a further discussion on Cruise. In conjunction with our announcement to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and our plans to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges of $0.5 billion.  These  charges  primarily  relate  to  anticipated  headcount  reductions  and  impairments  of  real  estate  lease  assets  and  certain intangible assets.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 39% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 42% in the corresponding period in 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing  programs  available  and  competing  third-party  financing  products  in  the  market.  G M  Financial's  prime  loan  originations  as  a  percentage  of  total  loan originations in North America was 81% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 82% in the corresponding period in 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2024, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 46%, retail finance charge income of 40% and commercial finance charge income of 8%.\n\nGM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. G ains on terminations of leased vehicles of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion were included in G M Financial interest, operating and other ex penses in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.

In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated.

      "answer": "Starbucks' International Segment, which includes the China reporting unit, saw its goodwill balance increase from $2,756.7 million in 2022 to $2,788.5 million in 2024. This growth was driven by continued international expansion and the strategic use of licensed stores, which accounted for 11% of total net revenues in 2022. By 2024, the total goodwill balance across all segments reached $3,315.7 million, with the International Segment still representing the largest portion.

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM experienced a $4.9 billion increase in collections and recoveries on finance receivables, which directly supported GM Financial's liquidity by providing a key source of cash inflow. GM Financial relies heavily on these collections to fund operations, repay debt, and maintain liquidity, as noted in 2023 filings. By 2023, GM Financial's commercial finance receivables, particularly dealer financing, grew to $13.3 billion, up from $10.6 billion in 2022, indicating a continued expansion of its financing portfolio.

Risk Factors, banks will no longer be persuaded or compelled to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. GM Financial established a LIBOR transition initiative in 2019 to evaluate the potential impacts of the transition, and continues to implement strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the LIBOR discontinuation such as including fallback language into any new LIBOR based contracts. GM Financial has only a limited amount of debt outstanding that  is  scheduled  to  mature  after  June  30,  2023  and  would  utilize  the Alternative  Reference  Rates  Committee  fallback  process. Furthermore, GM Financial has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's Fallbacks Protocol and plans to transition its existing LIBOR-based derivative exposure in advance of the June 30, 2023 date when applicable LIBOR will no longer be published. For any residual exposure after the end of 2021, GM Financial expects to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions to transition such exposure.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the  use  of  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods  presented.  We  believe  the  accounting  estimates  employed  are  appropriate  and  the  resulting  balances  are  reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments  to  these  balances  in  future  periods.  Refer  to  Note  2  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  our  significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.\n\nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GM Financial reported $13.3 billion in dealer financing receivables, which increased from $10.6 billion in 2022, indicating a growing reliance on commercial financing activities. This expansion in financing exposure directly tied GM Financial\u2019s financial health to automotive market conditions, particularly used vehicle pricing. By 2024, GM Financial's leasing program was explicitly exposed to residual value risks, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. The gains on terminations of leased vehicles dropped from $0.9 billion in 2023 to $0.8 billion in 2024, reflecting a decline in used vehicle price support. This shows that the increased commercial finance exposure in 2023 amplified GM Financial's sensitivity to used vehicle price fluctuations in 2024, as residual values directly impacted leasing profitability.",

These factors are impacting our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. We are in the late stages of finalizing details with our JV  partners on an agreement regarding certain restructuring actions, which include plant closures and portfolio optimization to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions, and updated business forecasts.\n\nBased on the updated forecast, we determined that the material loss in value of our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), SAIC GM (Shenyang) Norsom Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM Norsom), SAIC GM Dong Y ue Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM DY) and SAIC GM Dong Y ue Powertrain Co., Ltd. (SGM DYPT) was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024 which is included in equity income (loss). Our Automotive China JV s' equity losses also includes non-cash charges of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of the restructuring plan. We expect additional restructuring charges are likely to be incurred in 2025. G oing forward, we will continue to assess our strategy in the Chinese market to maintain presence while prioritizing profitability. In addition, G M Financial also concluded that a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC) existed. Refer to the \"Automotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook' section of this MD&amp;A for discussion of GM Financial's other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 25.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.9 million units for a market share of 3.7% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nCruise Cruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV  technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed development work on the Cruise Origin and recorded restructuring charges of $0.6 billion primarily related to noncash write-offs of Origin assets. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. Refer to Part I, Item 1. Business for a further discussion on Cruise. In conjunction with our announcement to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and our plans to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges of $0.5 billion.  These  charges  primarily  relate  to  anticipated  headcount  reductions  and  impairments  of  real  estate  lease  assets  and  certain intangible assets.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 39% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 42% in the corresponding period in 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing  programs  available  and  competing  third-party  financing  products  in  the  market.  G M  Financial's  prime  loan  originations  as  a  percentage  of  total  loan originations in North America was 81% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 82% in the corresponding period in 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2024, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 46%, retail finance charge income of 40% and commercial finance charge income of 8%.\n\nGM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. G ains on terminations of leased vehicles of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion were included in G M Financial interest, operating and other ex penses in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in gains is primarily due to fewer terminated leases in 2024 compared to 2023. The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent",

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks related to our operations\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability  of  affordable  financing,  elevated  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or uncertainty, the occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons, including a moderate to severe recession in any of the markets in which we operate, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials, energy or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, elevated cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials for our EV  propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EV s and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. G eopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic, regulatory and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials, energy and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of  the  largest  global  manufacturers  and  numerous  domestic  manufacturers,  which  have  ex perienced  significant  growth  in  customer  acceptance,  as  well  as  nontraditional  market  participants,  such  as  domestic  technology  companies.  Over  the  last  several  years,  this  intense  competition  and  an  increasingly  challenging operating environment negatively impacted the profitability of our operations in China, our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. As a result, in December 2024, our Board of Directors determined there to be a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JV s. Updated business forecasts and recent restructuring actions to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions have indicated that the loss in value is other-than-temporary for our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), certain SGM subsidiaries and SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC). As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024. We also recorded additional equity losses of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of these restructuring actions, which includes plant closures and portfolio optimization, in the year ended December 31, 2024. These charges are non-cash in nature. We expect SGM will likely incur additional restructuring charges in 2025. We cannot guarantee that the restructuring actions will be successful in our China JV s achieving long-term profitability or that additional, material restructuring actions will not be required.\n\nIn addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EV s, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies while achieving affordability. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China and the unique regulatory landscape in China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions, weakening economic conditions in China or China's level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.",

      "answer": "In 2022, third-party seller sales were a key driver of international sales growth, with Amazon noting that increased unit sales, including those by third-party sellers, contributed to a 22% growth in international sales. However, foreign exchange rate fluctuations had a significant impact, affecting international sales by $3.0 billion in 2021 (as reported in the 2022 filing). By 2024, third-party seller sales continued to support international growth, contributing to a 9% increase in international sales. Yet, the impact of foreign exchange rates remained a drag, reducing international net sales by $1.8 billion in 2024. This shows that while the growth rate of international sales slowed from 22% in 2021 to 9% in 2024, the continued expansion of third-party seller activity helped offset some of the headwinds from foreign exchange rate volatility.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Nike's Miscellaneous Revenues were explicitly described as part of Global Brand Divisions and included NIKE Brand licensing and other revenues not tied to geographic operating segments (Hop1 Evidence). By fiscal 2024, this category was reclassified under 'Other' revenue within Global Brand Divisions, amounting to $102 million (Hop3 Evidence). This shift reflects a strategic refinement in how Nike reports non-core revenues as part of its broader Consumer Direct Acceleration strategy, which reorganized the company around consumer segments like Men\u2019s, Women\u2019s, and Kids, and began in fiscal 2021 (Hop2 Evidence). The evolution from 'Miscellaneous Revenues' to 'Other' revenue suggests a more strategic alignment of non-geographic revenue streams with centralized brand management functions.",

      "answer": "Starbucks maintained a consistent goodwill allocation of $34.7 million to the Channel Development segment in both 2023 and 2024, indicating no change in the implied value of intangible assets tied to its licensed store model. This stability suggests the company viewed its strategic positioning in this segment as unchanged despite fluctuations in other segments. Given that the Channel Development segment includes licensed stores, which typically require less capital investment and offer higher margins, the lack of goodwill adjustment implies Starbucks likely maintained a steady approach to brand licensing and partner relationships during this period.",

        "Hop 1: SBUX(2023) \u2192 Goodwill Balance: Starbucks reported a goodwill balance of $34.7 million allocated to the Channel Development segment as of October 1, 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Goodwill Balance \u2192 Channel Development Segment: The Channel Development segment includes licensed stores and carries an associated goodwill value that reflects the premium paid for acquisitions or internal growth in that business area.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial disclosed that at December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of leased vehicles was $29.1 billion, with adjustments made to residual value estimates based on used vehicle prices. By 2024, GM reported residual values totaling $23,492 million, with crossovers alone accounting for $13,184 million (67.3%) and trucks contributing $7,458 million (23.7%) of total residual value. The combined residual value share for crossovers and trucks remained dominant, slightly increasing from 89.4% in 2023 to 91.0% in 2024. This concentration suggests that GM's risk exposure in automotive financing remains heavily tied to these two vehicle types, with potential volatility from changes in used vehicle prices affecting depreciation and impairment charges, as noted in GM Financial's risk disclosures regarding residual value performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM(2022) \u2192 GM Financial: GM depends on GM Financial for customer and dealer financing, and any reduction in GM Financial\u2019s ability to provide these services would negatively affect GM\u2019s vehicle sales and market penetration.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM relied heavily on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and dealers, which exposed GM to GM Financial's credit risk and performance in managing loan portfolios. By 2023, GM Financial disclosed an Allowance for Loan Losses of $2.3 billion for its retail finance receivables, based on economic forecasts including unemployment rates and GDP growth. The evolution of this allowance shows that GM's strategic dependence on GM Financial in 2022 directly influenced its financial exposure to credit losses in 2023, as GM Financial adjusted its allowance based on forecasted economic conditions and recovery rates. A 5% decrease in forecast recovery rates would have increased the allowance by $0.1 billion, highlighting the sensitivity of GM\u2019s financial risk profile to GM Financial\u2019s loan loss estimation methodology.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM's business model depended heavily on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to dealers, which exposed GM to GM Financial's credit risk management practices. GM Financial used static pool modeling and economic forecasts\u2014including unemployment rates and GDP growth\u2014to estimate expected credit losses and establish the Allowance for Loan Losses. By 2023, GM Financial disclosed that its Allowance for Loan Losses on retail finance receivables stood at $2.3 billion, with sensitivity analysis showing that a 5% decrease in forecast recovery rates would increase the allowance by $0.1 billion. This demonstrates that GM's earlier dependence on GM Financial's financing services created a direct link between GM's sales performance and GM Financial's credit risk exposure, which became visible in the increased allowance disclosed in 2023.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM Financial disclosed that it was liability-sensitive, meaning more liabilities than assets were expected to reprice within 12 months, which would reduce net interest income during rising rate periods. They used interest rate swaps and a Global Asset Liability Committee to manage this risk. By 2023, despite maintaining liability sensitivity, GM Financial had $13.3 billion in dealer financing (up from $10.6 billion in 2022), indicating continued reliance on this segment. The fair value of debt and finance leases was $16.5 billion in 2023, slightly lower than the $16.8 billion in 2022, suggesting modest balance sheet adjustments. These changes indicate that GM Financial maintained a similar risk profile but adjusted its hedging and financing strategies to manage net interest income sensitivity in a potentially rising rate environment.",

      "question": "How did the growth in GM's commercial finance receivables from $8.68 billion in 2022 to $13.3 billion in 2023 reflect changes in GM Financial's dealer financing strategy and risk management approach?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported $8.68 billion in commercial finance receivables, primarily consisting of dealer financings for inventory purchases, with no receivables on nonaccrual status, indicating strong credit control. By 2023, this figure grew to $13.3 billion in dealer financing, suggesting an expansion in GM Financial's lending activities. This increase implies that GM Financial likely adjusted its risk rating models or became more aggressive in extending credit to dealers, despite maintaining periodic credit reviews. The growth of over $4.6 billion in receivables indicates a strategic shift toward increased dealer support, possibly to boost vehicle sales or strengthen dealer relationships.",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2023, Starbucks' International Segment saw a decline in revenue, particularly in product and equipment sales and royalty income, which contributed to a reduction in the segment's goodwill balance from $2,756.7 million in 2022 to $2,691.1 million by the end of fiscal 2023. However, by fiscal 2024, the goodwill balance allocated to the International Segment increased to $2,788.5 million, suggesting that Starbucks either revised its future revenue projections or adjusted its valuation assumptions during its annual impairment testing, despite earlier revenue pressures. This pattern indicates that while the International Segment underperformed in 2023, Starbucks' management remained optimistic about its long-term value, as reflected in the goodwill balance in 2024.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "In 2020, GMNA fleet sales stood at 493 thousand units, reflecting a decline from 741 thousand units in 2019, indicating a significant drop in fleet demand during the early pandemic period. This trend reversed by 2023, where GMNA fleet sales rebounded to 679 thousand units, up from 399 thousand units in 2021.

      "answer": "In 2022, GM explicitly stated its dependence on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to dealers, noting that any reduction in GM Financial\u2019s ability to offer these services would negatively impact GM\u2019s efforts to support additional vehicle sales. GM Financial disclosed that it manages finance receivables using static pool modeling techniques to determine allowances for loan losses, incorporating forecasts of economic conditions such as unemployment rates and interest rate spreads. By 2024, the data showed that delinquency rates on finance receivables remained at 3.0% as of December 31, 2023, but the detailed breakdown revealed an upward trend in delinquencies across multiple origination years, indicating a potential deterioration in portfolio performance.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM invested $1.0 billion in Cruise to support its autonomous vehicle development. However, by 2024, Cruise had paused its AV operations in October 2023 and indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin in June 2024, leading to restructuring charges of $529 million and $631 million, respectively. In December 2024, GM announced it would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development, triggering an additional $522 million in charges. This indicates that GM's initial investment in Cruise did not yield the expected returns and instead led to significant restructuring costs as the strategic direction shifted.",

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\n\nGMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

      "question": "How did the impact of production costs on GM's financial performance in 2022 relate to the near-stable GMI revenue observed in 2023, and what does this suggest about cost management effectiveness in the GMI segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported that production costs negatively impacted EBIT (loss)-adjusted by $0.4 billion, contributing to a challenging financial year with a $271 million loss excluding equity income. By 2023, GMI revenue remained nearly flat at $14.164 billion compared to $14.166 billion in 2022, with cost changes only slightly affecting this stability (-$0.3 billion variance due to cost). This suggests that while production costs continued to exert downward pressure on profitability in 2023, GM managed to maintain GMI revenue through other factors like volume and mix improvements. The persistence of cost pressures across both years indicates ongoing challenges in production cost management despite revenue stabilization in the GMI segment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported $7,935 million in near-prime loans, representing 15.4% of total retail finance receivables. By 2023, this segment increased to $8,392 million but dropped to 12.8% of the total portfolio, indicating slower growth compared to prime loans. The FICO score distribution shows that prime loans (FICO \u2265 680) grew significantly from $32,800 million (64.0%) in 2022 to $47,543 million (72.8%) in 2023, suggesting a strategic shift toward higher-credit-quality borrowers. This evolution implies that GM's credit risk profile improved year-over-year, as the relative share of higher-risk near-prime and sub-prime loans decreased despite stable absolute levels, aligning with a more conservative credit strategy.",

      "question": "How did the delinquency rates in GM's finance receivables in 2022 impact GM Financial's loan loss provisioning strategy in 2023, particularly in relation to the growth in commercial finance receivables?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GM reported that finance receivables more than 30 days delinquent totaled $1,515 million, representing 2.9% of total receivables. This delinquency metric likely informed GM Financial\u2019s provisioning strategy in 2023, where they emphasized modeling techniques incorporating economic forecasts to maintain adequate loan loss reserves. By 2023, GM Financial reported a significant increase in commercial finance receivables, rising from $10.96 billion in 2022 to $13.78 billion in 2023, which would have required adjustments to the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience and forecasted auto industry conditions. This demonstrates a clear causal chain where prior year delinquency data (2022) influenced provisioning practices (via GM Financial) in 2023, especially as the portfolio expanded.",

        "Hop 1: GM(2022) \u2192 Finance Receivables: GM disclosed delinquency rates, including $1,515 million (2.9%) of finance receivables more than 30 days delinquent.",
