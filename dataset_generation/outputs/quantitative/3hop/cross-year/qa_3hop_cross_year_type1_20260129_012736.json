      "answer": "In 2022, a 2% increase in market interest rate led to an investment income per annum of $401. By 2024, the same 2% increase resulted in a significantly higher investment income per annum of $666. This indicates that UNH's investment portfolio became more sensitive to interest rate increases over time, likely due to changes in portfolio composition or size. The relationship between market interest rates and investment income per annum strengthened, showing a transformation in the entity chain evolution.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $9.6 billion in 2021, an increase of 8% compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including compensation and benefits, higher promotional expenses in support of the Company's key growth pillars, and higher acquisition-related costs, including costs related to the acquisition of Acceleron. The COVID-19 pandemic drove lower spending in 2020 which contributed to the increase in SG&amp;A expenses in 2021. These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  the  favorable  effects  of  foreign  exchange  and  a  contribution  in  2020  to  the  Merck Foundation. SG&amp;A expenses were $9.0 billion in 2020, a decline of 5% compared with 2019. The decline was driven primarily by lower administrative, selling and promotional costs, including lower travel and meeting expenses, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the favorable effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by a contribution to the Merck Foundation.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $12.2 billion in 2021, a decline of 9% compared with 2020 primarily due  to  lower  upfront  payments  related  to  acquisitions  and  collaborations.  The  decline  was  partially  offset  by  higher  clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development, net of the reimbursement of a portion of molnupiravir development costs through the partnership with Ridgeback. Higher compensation and benefit costs, higher in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) impairment charges, as well as costs related to the acquisition of Acceleron also partially offset the decline in R&amp;D expenses in 2021. R&amp;D expenses were $13.4 billion in 2020, an increase of 38% compared with 2019.  The  increase  was  driven  largely  by  higher  upfront  payments  related  to  acquisitions  and  collaborations,  higher  clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. Higher restructuring costs also contributed to the increase in R&amp;D expenses in 2020. The increase in R&amp;D expenses in 2020 was partially offset by lower IPR&amp;D impairment charges and lower costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, net of spending on COVID-19-related vaccine and antiviral research programs.\n\nR&amp;D expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by Merck Research Laboratories (MRL), the Company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were $7.1 billion in 2021, $6.5 billion in 2020 and $6.0 billion in 2019. Also included in R&amp;D expenses are Animal Health research costs, licensing costs and costs incurred by other divisions in support of R&amp;D activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, which in the aggregate were $3.0 billion in 2021, $2.6 billion in 2020 and $2.6 billion in 2019. Additionally, R&amp;D expenses in 2021 include a $1.7  billion  charge  for  the  acquisition  of  Pandion.  R&amp;D  expenses  in  2020  include  a  $2.7  billion  charge  for  the  acquisition  of VelosBio Inc., a $462 million charge for the acquisition of OncoImmune and charges of $826 million related to transactions with Seagen.  R&amp;D  expenses  in  2019  include  a  $993  million  charge  for  the  acquisition  of  Peloton.  See  Note  4  to  the  consolidated financial statements for more information on these transactions. R&amp;D expenses also include IPR&amp;D impairment charges of $275 million, $90 million and $172 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company may recognize additional impairment charges in the future related to  the  cancellation  or  delay  of  other  pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business combinations and such charges could be material. In addition, R&amp;D expenses in 2021 and 2020 include $28 million and $83 million, respectively, of costs associated with restructuring  activities,  primarily  relating  to  accelerated  depreciation.  R&amp;D  expenses  also  include  expense  or  income  related  to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration recorded in connection with business combinations. The Company recorded $35 million of expenses in 2021 compared with a net reduction in expenses of $95 million and $39 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to changes in these estimates.\n\n## Restructuring Costs\n\nIn  2019,  Merck  approved  a  global  restructuring  program  (Restructuring  Program)  as  part  of  a  worldwide  initiative focused  on  further  optimizing  the  Company's  manufacturing  and  supply  network,  as  well  as  reducing  its  global  real  estate footprint. This program is a continuation of the Company's plant rationalization and builds on prior restructuring programs. The actions currently contemplated under the Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $3.5 billion. The Company expects to record charges of",

The Keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.\n\nGlobal sales of Keytruda grew 18% in 2024, or 22% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the devaluation of the A rgentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. Keytruda sales growth in the U.S. reflects higher demand across the multiple approved metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of bladder, endometrial, microsatellite instability-high (M SI-H) and renal cell cancers, as well as increased uptake across earlier-stage indications, including in certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NSCLC and RCC, and higher pricing. Keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the TNBC, melanoma and RCC earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in cervical, gastric and renal cell cancer metastatic indications. The Company expects that the 2025 launch and reimbursement of new indications for Keytruda in the EU will have a negative impact on pricing in those markets.\n\nSummarized below are the Keytruda regulatory approvals received in 2024 and, to date, in 2025.\n\n",

This indicates a shift in capital investment strategy for the Nutritionals segment, with a 16.4% decrease in capital expenditures ($457M to $382M) despite a 3.1% growth in total assets, suggesting either a more efficient use of existing assets or a strategic reallocation of capital away from property and equipment additions in the Nutritionals segment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CVS reported a generic dispensing rate of 87.6%, indicating a strong baseline for generic drug adoption. By 2024, this rate increased to 88.9%, primarily driven by new generic drug introductions and the company's strategic initiatives to encourage plan members to opt for generics when clinically appropriate. This improvement aligns with the objectives of the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, which is one of the four reportable segments of CVS and is evaluated based on adjusted operating income. The upward trend in generic dispensing reflects the segment's focus on cost containment and value-based care, reinforcing the company's broader strategy to enhance affordability and operational efficiency in pharmacy services.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company's segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for 24%, 19% and 18%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company's segments to the consolidated totals:",

      "answer": "In 2023, Keytruda generated $25,011 million in sales, representing a year-over-year growth from $20,937 million in 2022. In 2024, Keytruda sales grew by 18%, or 22% when excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange, with the Argentine peso devaluation being a primary contributor to the negative FX impact. This foreign exchange effect was partially offset by inflation-related price increases, particularly in Argentina. The 2024 FX impact also affected other segments like Animal Health, where the peso devaluation contributed to a 4% sales growth, or 8% excluding FX. Thus, the trajectory of Keytruda sales growth was significantly influenced by foreign exchange dynamics between 2023 and 2024.",

( 2 )\n\nKeytruda is an anti-PD-1 therapy that has been approved in over 40 indications in the U.S., including 18 tumor types and 2 tumor-agnostic indications, and has similarly been approved in markets worldwide for many of these indications. The Keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.\n\nGlobal sales of Keytruda grew 18% in 2024, or 22% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the devaluation of the A rgentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. Keytruda sales growth in the U.S. reflects higher demand across the multiple approved metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of bladder, endometrial, microsatellite instability-high (M SI-H) and renal cell cancers, as well as increased uptake across earlier-stage indications, including in certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NSCLC and RCC, and higher pricing. Keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the TNBC, melanoma and RCC earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in cervical, gastric and renal cell cancer metastatic indications. The Company expects that the 2025 launch and reimbursement of new indications for Keytruda in the EU will have a negative impact on pricing in those markets.\n\nSummarized below are the Keytruda regulatory approvals received in 2024 and, to date, in 2025.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, UnitedHealth Group's earnings from operations increased by $3,923 million, with Optum contributing $1,887 million of that growth. Optum's performance was driven by growth across its businesses, particularly in Optum Health and Optum Insight, despite higher care activity and costs. In 2024, the parent company's investment in subsidiaries, including Optum, was reflected in a $19.3 billion dividend received from subsidiaries, up from $18.5 billion in 2023, indicating a strengthening financial relationship and increased capital return from Optum to the parent company.",

      "question": "How did the changes in CVS's Retail/LTC segment cost structure in 2022 relate to the 3.2% decline in adjusted operating income by 2024, particularly in light of reduced front store volume and the $349 million loss on LTC assets held for sale?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's Retail/LTC segment disclosed that its cost of products sold included prescription drug costs, purchasing, warehousing, and delivery costs, as well as inventory losses, which directly influenced gross margin pressures. By 2024, the Retail/LTC segment (now part of the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment) experienced a 3.2% decline in adjusted operating income, or $189 million, driven by reduced front store volume and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits. Additionally, the $349 million loss on LTC assets held for sale in 2023 signaled strategic divestiture pressures that likely impacted the segment's cost structure and operating performance into 2024. This indicates that the earlier cost structure challenges in the Retail/LTC segment contributed to the financial pressures seen in adjusted operating income two years later.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "How did the sensitivity of UnitedHealth Group's Fair Value of Financial Liabilities to a 2% increase in Market Interest Rate change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this imply about their interest rate risk exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, a 2% increase in Market Interest Rate led to a Fair Value of Financial Liabilities of $8,142 million, while in 2024, the same 2% increase resulted in a higher liability value of $8,866 million. This indicates that UnitedHealth Group's Fair Value of Financial Liabilities became more sensitive to interest rate increases over time, suggesting an expansion in interest rate risk exposure. The relationship between Fair Value of Financial Liabilities and Market Interest Rate is negative, meaning that as interest rates rise, the fair value of liabilities decreases, and vice versa. However, the magnitude of this sensitivity increased from 2023 to 2024, implying a greater financial impact for similar interest rate movements in the later year.",

        "Hop 2: Fair Value of Financial Liabilities \u2192 Market Interest Rate: The relationship is negatively correlated, meaning rising interest rates reduce the fair value of liabilities.",

      "question": "How did the increase in AbbVie's upfront payments from $582 million in 2023 to $975 million in 2024 reflect a shift in the company's licensing rights strategy, particularly in relation to the types of collaborative arrangements and milestone-linked obligations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, AbbVie expensed $582 million in upfront payments tied to licensing rights under collaborative arrangements, such as those with Janssen Biotech and Genentech, which often included milestone-linked obligations and development cost-sharing. By 2024, upfront payments increased to $975 million, signaling a more aggressive investment in external innovation and partnership-driven R&D. This increase was accompanied by potential future milestone payments of up to $10.1 billion, indicating that AbbVie expanded its licensing rights portfolio by entering into more early-stage, high-potential collaborations. The evolution from 2023 to 2024 shows a strategic shift toward leveraging licensing rights to access a broader pipeline, with upfront payments serving as a gateway to larger downstream commitments tied to development, regulatory, and commercial milestones.",

        "Hop 1: ABBV(2023) \u2192 Licensing Rights: AbbVie received licensing rights under collaborative agreements, with upfront payments expensed to acquired IPR&D and milestones expense, including $582 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Licensing Rights \u2192 Upfront Payments: Licensing rights include upfront payments made to partners, which are expensed upfront unless tied to post-approval milestones, indicating a direct financial commitment tied to future performance.",

The transaction was accounted for as the sale of an asset. Upon completion of the transaction, AbbVie received net cash proceeds of $215 million and recognized a pre-tax gain of $172 million which was recorded in other operating income in the consolidated statement of earnings in the second quarter of 2022.\n\n## Other Arrangements\n\nIn addition to the significant arrangements described above, AbbVie entered into several other arrangements resulting in charges related to upfront payments of $975 million in 2024, $582 million in 2023 and $315 million in 2022. In connection with the other individually insignificant early-stage arrangements entered into in 2024, AbbVie could make additional payments of up to $10.1 billion upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. Acquired IPR&amp;D and milestones expense also included development milestones of $130 million in 2024, $196 million in 2023 and $252 million in 2022.\n\n## Note 6 Collaborations\n\nThe company has ongoing transactions with other entities through collaboration agreements. The following represent the significant collaboration agreements impacting 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\n## Collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc.\n\nIn December 2011, Pharmacyclics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of AbbVie, entered into a worldwide collaboration and license agreement with Janssen Biotech, Inc. and its affiliates (Janssen), one of the Janssen Pharmaceutical companies of Johnson &amp; Johnson, for the joint development and commercialization of Imbruvica, a novel, orally active, selective covalent inhibitor of Bruton's tyrosine kinase and certain compounds structurally related to Imbruvica, for oncology and other indications, excluding all immune and inflammatory mediated diseases or conditions and all psychiatric or psychological diseases or conditions, in the United States and outside the United States.\n\nThe collaboration provides Janssen with an exclusive license to commercialize Imbruvica outside of the United States and co-exclusively with AbbVie in the United States. Both parties are responsible for the development, manufacturing and marketing of any products generated as a result of the collaboration. The collaboration has no set duration or specific expiration date and provides for potential future development, regulatory and approval milestone payments of up to $200 million to AbbVie. The collaboration also includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated collaboration activities. Except in certain cases, Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of collaboration development costs and AbbVie is responsible for the remaining 40% of collaboration development costs.\n\nIn the United States, both parties have co-exclusive rights to commercialize the products; however, AbbVie is the principal in the end-customer product sales. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and losses equally from the commercialization of products. Sales of Imbruvica are included in AbbVie's net revenues. Janssen's share of profits is included in AbbVie's cost of products sold. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line i tems, net of Janssen's share.\n\nOutside the United States, Janssen is responsible for and has exclusive rights to commercialize Imbruvica. AbbVie and Janssen share pre-tax profits and l osses equally from the commercialization of products. AbbVie's share of profits is included in AbbVie's net revenues. Other costs incurred under the collaboration are reported in their respective expense line items, net of Janssen's share.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, UNH's Earnings from Operations were negatively impacted by increased care costs related to the pandemic and risk-adjusted business challenges. However, Optum Health contributed positively to earnings through cost management and growth in value-based arrangements, serving 100 million people by year-end. By 2024, Optum Health's earnings from operations continued to grow due to business portfolio refinement and investment income, but were increasingly influenced by the financial risks associated with value-based care, such as costs for newly added patients and medical care activity. This created a dual dynamic where Optum Health both supported and exposed UNH's earnings to greater volatility. The segment served 100 million people in 2024, down from 103 million in 2023, indicating potential strain in sustaining growth under these arrangements.",

RISK FACTORS\n\n## CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\n\nThe statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words 'believe,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'estimate,' 'anticipate,' 'forecast,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'should' or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the 'safe harbor' provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forwardlooking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, ex cept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.\n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings with the SEC or other communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in our previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effectiv e manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health's fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

      "question": "How did the change in CVS's amortized cost basis for the 2 to 4-year maturity segment from 2023 to 2024 reflect the company's evolving exposure to the 2021 amortized cost basis, and what does this indicate about their asset management strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CVS reported $225 million in the 2 to 4-year maturity segment tied to the 2021 amortized cost basis. By 2024, this exposure decreased to $205 million, indicating a reduction in holdings originating from 2021 within that maturity range. This reflects a strategic shift in asset management where older amortized cost basis segments are being reduced or reallocated, potentially to optimize liquidity or adjust risk exposure.",

By 2023, the negative impact of foreign exchange intensified, contributing to a 25% overall drop in Januvia/Janumet revenue (from $4,513 million in 2022 to $3,366 million in 2023), with 23% of the decline attributed to currency effects. This shows that MRK's diabetes portfolio became more exposed to foreign exchange risk over this period, as the currency impact grew both in magnitude and relative contribution to the revenue decline.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&amp;A) expenses were $9.6 billion in 2021, an increase of 8% compared with 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher administrative costs, including compensation and benefits, higher promotional expenses in support of the Company's key growth pillars, and higher acquisition-related costs, including costs related to the acquisition of Acceleron. The COVID-19 pandemic drove lower spending in 2020 which contributed to the increase in SG&amp;A expenses in 2021. These  increases  were  partially  offset  by  the  favorable  effects  of  foreign  exchange  and  a  contribution  in  2020  to  the  Merck Foundation. SG&amp;A expenses were $9.0 billion in 2020, a decline of 5% compared with 2019. The decline was driven primarily by lower administrative, selling and promotional costs, including lower travel and meeting expenses, due in part to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the favorable effect of foreign exchange, partially offset by a contribution to the Merck Foundation.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development (R&amp;D) expenses were $12.2 billion in 2021, a decline of 9% compared with 2020 primarily due  to  lower  upfront  payments  related  to  acquisitions  and  collaborations.  The  decline  was  partially  offset  by  higher  clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development, net of the reimbursement of a portion of molnupiravir development costs through the partnership with Ridgeback. Higher compensation and benefit costs, higher in-process research and development (IPR&amp;D) impairment charges, as well as costs related to the acquisition of Acceleron also partially offset the decline in R&amp;D expenses in 2021. R&amp;D expenses were $13.4 billion in 2020, an increase of 38% compared with 2019.  The  increase  was  driven  largely  by  higher  upfront  payments  related  to  acquisitions  and  collaborations,  higher  clinical development spending and increased investment in discovery research and early drug development. Higher restructuring costs also contributed to the increase in R&amp;D expenses in 2020. The increase in R&amp;D expenses in 2020 was partially offset by lower IPR&amp;D impairment charges and lower costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, net of spending on COVID-19-related vaccine and antiviral research programs.\n\nR&amp;D expenses are comprised of the costs directly incurred by Merck Research Laboratories (MRL), the Company's research and development division that focuses on human health-related activities, which were $7.1 billion in 2021, $6.5 billion in 2020 and $6.0 billion in 2019. Also included in R&amp;D expenses are Animal Health research costs, licensing costs and costs incurred by other divisions in support of R&amp;D activities, including depreciation, production and general and administrative, which in the aggregate were $3.0 billion in 2021, $2.6 billion in 2020 and $2.6 billion in 2019. Additionally, R&amp;D expenses in 2021 include a $1.7  billion  charge  for  the  acquisition  of  Pandion.  R&amp;D  expenses  in  2020  include  a  $2.7  billion  charge  for  the  acquisition  of VelosBio Inc., a $462 million charge for the acquisition of OncoImmune and charges of $826 million related to transactions with Seagen.  R&amp;D  expenses  in  2019  include  a  $993  million  charge  for  the  acquisition  of  Peloton.  See  Note  4  to  the  consolidated financial statements for more information on these transactions. R&amp;D expenses also include IPR&amp;D impairment charges of $275 million, $90 million and $172 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively (see Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements). The Company may recognize additional impairment charges in the future related to  the  cancellation  or  delay  of  other  pipeline programs that were measured at fair value and capitalized in connection with business combinations and such charges could be material. In addition, R&amp;D expenses in 2021 and 2020 include $28 million and $83 million, respectively, of costs associated with restructuring  activities,  primarily  relating  to  accelerated  depreciation.  R&amp;D  expenses  also  include  expense  or  income  related  to changes in the estimated fair value measurement of liabilities for contingent consideration recorded in connection with business combinations. The Company recorded $35 million of expenses in 2021 compared with a net reduction in expenses of $95 million and $39 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to changes in these estimates.\n\n## Restructuring Costs\n\nIn  2019,  Merck  approved  a  global  restructuring  program  (Restructuring  Program)  as  part  of  a  worldwide  initiative focused  on  further  optimizing  the  Company's  manufacturing  and  supply  network,  as  well  as  reducing  its  global  real  estate footprint. This program is a continuation of the Company's plant rationalization and builds on prior restructuring programs. The actions currently contemplated under the Restructuring Program are expected to be substantially completed by the end of 2023, with the cumulative pretax costs to be incurred by the Company to implement the program estimated to be approximately $3.5 billion. The Company expects to record charges of",

      "question": "How did the increase in JNJ's MedTech segment acquisition and integration costs from 2022 to 2024 reflect changes in strategic focus, particularly with respect to the Shockwave and Abiomed acquisitions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ rebranded its Medical Devices segment to the MedTech segment, signaling a renewed strategic focus on innovation and market expansion across its surgical, orthopedic, vision, and interventional solutions franchises. By 2024, this strategy was reflected in the company's financial disclosures, which showed a significant increase in acquisition and integration costs\u2014rising from $0.2 billion in 2023 (related to Abiomed) to $1.0 billion in 2024 (primarily for Shockwave). This shift indicates a more aggressive acquisition strategy in 2024, with the Shockwave acquisition representing a major investment in interventional cardiology technology. The $0.5 billion in acquired in-process R&D costs from the V-Wave acquisition and additional $0.2 billion in amortization tied to Shockwave further underscore JNJ's focus on integrating high-potential technologies into its MedTech portfolio. These changes contrast with the earlier year\u2019s emphasis on organic growth and market recovery, showing a pivot toward inorganic growth through strategic acquisitions.",

      "question": "How did the Animal Health segment's contribution to Merck's overall profitability change between 2022 and 2024, and what does this reveal about how segment profits are calculated and reported across years?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck's Animal Health segment reported profits of $1,963 million, while in 2024, this figure was $1,938 million \u2014 indicating a slight decline in segment profitability over the two-year period. Despite this small drop, the Animal Health segment continued to be a consistent contributor to Merck's overall earnings, especially when compared to the volatility seen in the Non-segment activity line. According to the 2024 filing, Animal Health segment profits are calculated as segment sales less cost of sales, selling, general and administrative expenses, and research and development costs directly incurred by the segment. This contrasts with the Pharmaceutical segment, where certain R&D expenses (particularly those from Merck Research Laboratories) are not allocated to segment profits. This reveals that the Animal Health segment bears more of its direct R&D costs within its profitability metric, which could help explain the more stable but slightly declining trend in its reported profits from 2022 to 2024.",

Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

      "question": "How might the 2023 benefit from increased investment income have potentially masked emerging challenges in medical cost management that became a heightened risk for Optum Health in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Optum Health's earnings from operations increased, in part due to higher investment income, which helped offset elevated care activity, particularly in senior outpatient and behavioral health services. This financial boost may have temporarily improved earnings performance, despite rising care delivery costs. However, by 2024, the company flagged significant risk related to its ability to manage medical costs under value-based arrangements, specifically noting that overestimation or mismanagement of medical expenses could materially affect results. This suggests that the earlier gains from investment income may have masked underlying pressures in cost control that later emerged as a critical risk in 2024.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UNH(2023) \u2192 Investment Income: Increased investment income contributed to higher earnings from operations at Optum Health in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Investment Income \u2192 Optum Health: Investment gains helped offset rising care activity costs, particularly in senior outpatient and behavioral health services, supporting operational performance.",
        "Hop 3: Optum Health \u2190 UNH(2024): By 2024, Optum Health faced heightened risk disclosures around medical cost estimation and management under value-based arrangements, indicating that prior financial support from investment income may have concealed growing cost pressures."

When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words 'believe,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'estimate,' 'anticipate,' 'forecast,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'should' or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the 'safe harbor' provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forwardlooking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, ex cept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.\n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings with the SEC or other communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in our previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effectiv e manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health's fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

      "question": "How did the increase in milestone payments in 2023, compared to 2022, impact the profitability of JNJ's Innovative Medicine segment, and what strategic actions were taken in response to this change?",
      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ expensed milestone payments as incurred for R&D collaborations, directly impacting R&D costs. By 2023, milestone payments increased, contributing to a rise in expenses for the Innovative Medicine segment. Despite this, the segment's pre-tax income as a percent of sales improved from 29.8% in 2022 to 33.3% in 2023, partly due to lower one-time costs and R&D portfolio prioritization. In response, JNJ initiated restructuring actions within the segment, including exiting certain R&D programs in infectious diseases and vaccines (e.g., RSV adult vaccine, hepatitis, and HIV), resulting in a $479 million pre-tax restructuring expense in 2023. This strategic shift aimed to focus on high-impact therapeutic areas and improve long-term profitability.",

The ROU asset pertaining to operating leases was $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The lease liability was $1.0 billion and $1.1 billion in 2021and 2020, respectively. The operating lease costs were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities were $0.3 billion, $0.3 billion and $0.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Product Liability\n\nAccruals for product liability claims are recorded, on an undiscounted basis, when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on existing information and actuarially determined estimates where applicable. The accruals are adjusted periodically as additional information becomes available. The Company accrues an estimate of the legal defense costs needed to defend each matter when those costs are probable and can be reasonably estimated. To the extent adverse verdicts have been rendered against the Company, the Company does not record an accrual until a loss is determined to be probable and can be reasonably estimated.\n\nThe Company has self insurance through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. In addition to accruals in the self insurance program, claims that exceed the insurance coverage are accrued when losses are probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses are expensed as incurred in accordance with ASC 730, Research and Development. Upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with research and development collaborations are expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval. Payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product. Amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles, net of accumulated amortization.\n\nThe Company enters into collaborative arrangements, typically with other pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, to develop and commercialize drug candidates or intellectual property. These arrangements typically involve two (or more) parties who are active participants in the collaboration and are exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activities. These collaborations usually involve various activities by one or more parties, including research and development, marketing and selling and distribution. Often, these collaborations require upfront, milestone and royalty or profit share payments, contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development. Amounts due from collaborative partners related to development activities are generally reflected as a reduction of research and development expense because the performance of contract development services is not central to the Company's operations. In general, the income statement presentation for these collaborations is as follows:\n\n",

RISK FACTORS\n\n## CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\n\nThe statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words 'believe,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'estimate,' 'anticipate,' 'forecast,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'should' or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the 'safe harbor' provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forwardlooking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, ex cept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.\n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings with the SEC or other communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in our previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effectiv e manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health's fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

      "answer": "The Corporate & Other segment at CVS saw a significant increase in its net investment income, rising from $278 million in 2022 to $370 million in 2023, reflecting a positive internal development within this specific segment. However, this growth contrasts with the company's overall net investment income, which declined from $406 million in 2022 to $394 million in 2023. This divergence suggests that while the Corporate & Other segment improved its investment performance, other segments or corporate-wide factors likely experienced declines that offset these gains. The broader decline in total net investment income indicates that the company's overall investment portfolio underperformed despite positive contributions from certain segments, potentially signaling challenges in broader asset allocation, market conditions, or risk management strategies across the enterprise.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS disclosed that its investment performance included private equity, hedge funds, and real estate, with performance reviewed quarterly and impacting net investment income. By 2024, the company's net periodic benefit income was influenced by these investment outcomes, as noted in the pension plan assumptions. Specifically, the expected return on plan assets assumption played a key role in calculating net periodic benefit income. The connection between investment performance and benefit income is negatively impacted, meaning underperformance in assets such as private equity or real estate would reduce net periodic benefit income. This aligns with the broader trend where investment performance directly affects the company's ability to meet pension obligations and influences financial planning.",

          "chunk_text": "## Other Investments\n\nOther investments consist primarily of the following:\n\n- Private equity and hedge fund limited partnerships, which are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under this method, the carrying value of the investment is based on the value of the Company's equity ownership of the underlying investment funds provided by the general partner or manager of the investments, the financial statements of which generally are audited. As a result of the timing of the receipt of the valuation information provided by the fund managers, these investments are generally reported on up to a three month lag. The Company reviews investments for impairment at least quarterly and monitors their performance throughout the year through discussions with the administrators, managers and/or general partners. If the Company becomes aware of an impairment of a limited partnership's investments through its review or prior to receiving the limited partnership's financial statements at the financial statement date, an impairment will be recognized by recording a reduction in the carrying value of the limited partnership with a corresponding charge to net investment income.\n- Investment real estate, which is carried on the consolidated balance sheets at depreciated cost, including capital additions, net of write-downs for other-than-temporary declines in fair value. Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful life of each asset. If any real estate investment is considered held-for-sale, it is carried at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less estimated selling costs. The Company generally estimates fair value using net operating income and applying a capitalization rate in conjunction with comparable sales information. At the time of the sale, the difference between the sales price and the carrying value is recorded as a realized capital gain or loss.\n- Privately-placed equity securities, which are carried on the consolidated balance sheets at cost less impairments, plus or minus subsequent adjustments for observable price changes. Additionally, as a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Boston ('FHLBB'), a subsidiary of the Company is required to purchase and hold shares of the FHLBB. These shares are restricted and carried at cost.\n\n## Net Investment Income\n\nNet investment income on the Company's investments is recorded when earned and is reflected in the Company's net income (other than net investment income on assets supporting experience-rated products). Experience-rated products are products in the large case pensions business where the contract holder, not the Company, assumes investment and other risks, subject to, among other things, minimum guarantees provided by the Company. The effect of investment performance on experience-rated products is allocated to contract holders' accounts daily, based on the underlying investment experience and, therefore, does not impact the Company's net income (as long as the contract's minimum guarantees are not triggered). Net investment income on assets supporting large case pensions' experience-rated products is included in net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations and is credited to contract holders' accounts through a charge to benefit costs. The contract holders' accounts are reflected in policyholders' funds on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments (other than realized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experiencerated products) are included as a component of net investment income in the consolidated statements of operations. Realized capital gains and losses are determined on a specific identification basis. Purchases and sales of debt and equity securities and alternative investments are reflected on the trade date. Purchases and sales of mortgage loans and investment real estate are reflected on the closing date.\n\nRealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting large case pensions' experience-rated products are not included in realized capital gains and losses in the consolidated statements of operations and instead are credited directly to contract holders' accounts. The contract holders' accounts are reflected in policyholders' funds on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nUnrealized capital gains and losses on investments (other than unrealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting experience-rated products) are reflected in shareholders' equity, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Unrealized capital gains and losses on investments supporting large case pensions' experience-rated products are credited directly to contract holders' accounts. The contract holders' accounts are reflected in policyholders' funds on the consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments\n\nThe Company uses derivative financial instruments in order to manage interest rate and foreign exchange risk and credit exposure. The Company's use of these derivatives is generally limited to hedging risk and has principally consisted of using interest rate swaps, treasury rate locks, forward contracts, futures contracts, warrants, put options and credit default swaps.",

By 2024, R&D investment in the MedTech segment had risen to $3,703 million, representing 11.6% of segment sales. This demonstrates a focused effort to leverage existing asset strength in Medical Devices to drive innovation and product development, as the company increased R&D intensity from 10.3% in 2023 to 11.6% in 2024, despite broader MedTech revenue growth being relatively modest.",

      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ reported increased brand marketing expenses in the Consumer Health segment, signaling a strategic focus on strengthening its market position in this area. Correspondingly, the Consumer Health segment saw $331 million in additions to property, plant, and equipment in 2022. By 2023, total company-wide additions to property, plant, and equipment increased to $4,543 million. This significant rise indicates a broader capital allocation strategy emphasizing expansion and infrastructure investment across the company. The evolution suggests that JNJ may have transitioned from investing in brand visibility and marketing in 2022 to scaling up capital expenditures in 2023, potentially to support production and operational capabilities in alignment with the segment's strategic importance.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Abbott's Established Pharmaceuticals segment achieved a sales growth of 10.9%, driven by higher sales in geographies like India, Vietnam, and Brazil. This growth was accompanied by $185 million in Additions to Property and Equipment. In 2024, despite maintaining a strong sales performance trajectory, the company slightly reduced its capital investment in the segment to $183 million. This modest decline in capital expenditure, even in the context of sustained sales growth, suggests Abbott may have prioritized capital efficiency or reallocated resources to other strategic growth areas, such as diagnostics or medical devices, which saw increased investment year-over-year.",

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth's 2022 cost management initiatives impact Optum Health's operational performance in 2024, and what risks emerged from this relationship as the company refined its value-based care strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth implemented cost management initiatives that positively impacted Optum Health\u2019s earnings from operations, contributing to an increase in the number of people served from 98 million (2020) to 100 million (2021). By 2024, these initiatives continued to support Optum Health\u2019s growth, particularly through value-based care arrangements and strategic transactions, despite facing offsetting pressures such as Medicare Advantage funding reductions and costs associated with newly added patients. However, the company's 2024 risk disclosures highlighted growing exposure to financial risk under value-based arrangements, noting that failure to manage medical costs effectively could materially affect profitability. This indicates that while cost management strategies from 2022 helped drive performance through 2024, they also introduced new risk dynamics tied to Optum Health\u2019s expanded role in accountable care models.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UNH(2022) \u2192 Cost Management Initiatives: UnitedHealth implemented cost management strategies that contributed to operational efficiency gains, particularly in Optum Health, which saw increased earnings and patient growth.",
        "Hop 2: Cost Management Initiatives \u2192 Optum Health: These initiatives had a direct positive impact on Optum Health\u2019s earnings from operations, supporting growth in value-based arrangements and patient capacity.",
        "Hop 3: Optum Health \u2190 UNH(2024): By 2024, while Optum Health continued to benefit from these cost strategies, the company flagged increased risk exposure due to its reliance on value-based care models, where cost overruns could materially impact profitability."

Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives.\n\n## Optum Rx\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain and cost management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion adjusted scripts in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

RISK FACTORS\n\n## CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS\n\nThe statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K include forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA). When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in future filings by us with the SEC, in our news releases, presentations to securities analysts or investors, and in oral statements made by or with the approval of one of our executive officers, the words 'believe,' 'expect,' 'intend,' 'estimate,' 'anticipate,' 'forecast,' 'outlook,' 'plan,' 'project,' 'should' or similar words or phrases are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are intended to take advantage of the 'safe harbor' provisions of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. Any forwardlooking statement in this report speaks only as of the date of this report and, ex cept as required by law, we undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances, including unanticipated events, after the date of this report.\n\nThe following discussion contains cautionary statements regarding our business, which investors and others should consider. We do not undertake to address in future filings with the SEC or other communications regarding our business or results of operations how any of these factors may have caused our results to differ from discussions or information contained in our previous filings or communications. In addition, any of the matters discussed below may have affected past, as well as current, forward-looking statements about future results. Any or all forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other SEC filings or public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. Our forward-looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors discussed below will be important in determining our future results. By their nature, forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions which are difficult to predict or quantify.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\n\nIf we fail to estimate, price for and manage our medical costs or design benefits in an effectiv e manner, the profitability of our risk-based products and services could decline and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThrough our risk-based benefit products, we assume the risk of both medical and administrative costs for our customers in return for monthly premiums. The profitability of our products depends in large part on our ability to predict and effectively price for and manage medical costs. Our Optum Health business also enters into fully accountable value-based arrangements with payers. Premium revenues from risk-based products constitute nearly 80% of our total consolidated revenues. Estimates of benefit expense payments involve extensive judgement and are subject to considerable inherent variability. Relatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs, or utilization rates as a percentage of revenues, have resulted and in the future may result in significant changes in our financial results. If we fail to predict accurately, or effectively price for or manage, the costs of providing care under risk-based arrangements, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe manage medical costs through underwriting criteria, product design, negotiation of competitive provider contracts and care management programs. Total medical costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Although we base the premiums we charge on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors may cause, and have previously caused, actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums or bids. These factors may include medical cost inflation, increased use of services, business mix, unexpected differences among new customer populations, increased cost of individual services, costs to deliver care, large-scale medical emergencies, the potential effects of climate change, pandemics, the introduction of new or costly drugs or increases in drug prices, treatments and technology, new treatment guidelines, newly mandated benefits or other regulatory changes and insured population characteristics. Cost increases in excess of our forecasts typically cannot be recovered in the fixed premium period through higher premiums. For Optum Health's fully accountable value-based care, any inability to provide higher-quality outcomes and better experiences at lower costs or to integrate our care delivery models could impact our results of operations, financial positions and cash flows.\n\nIn addition, the financial results we report for any particular period include estimates of costs incurred for which claims are still outstanding. These estimates involve an extensive degree of judgment. If these estimates prove inaccurate, our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in JNJ's Consumer Health identifiable assets from 2020 ($27,355 million) to 2022 ($25,081 million) influence the company's decision to separate the Consumer Health segment in 2023, and what does this imply about the segment's strategic value by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ reported that its Consumer Health segment had $25,081 million in identifiable assets, down from $27,355 million in 2020, indicating a decline in asset value and potentially signaling reduced strategic focus. This downward trend in asset value preceded the formal separation of the Consumer Health business in Q3 2023, suggesting that the segment had become less central to JNJ\u2019s core operations. By 2024, JNJ had fully restructured into two segments \u2014 Innovative Medicine and MedTech \u2014 confirming that Consumer Health was no longer part of continuing operations. The asset decline from 2020 to 2022 aligns with a broader strategic shift that culminated in the segment\u2019s spin-off, implying that JNJ prioritized higher-growth, more innovative areas post-2023.",

        "Hop 2: Identifiable Assets 2020 \u2192 Consumer Health: The identifiable assets metric is directly tied to the Consumer Health segment's financial footprint and operational significance within JNJ.",
        "Hop 3: Consumer Health \u2190 JNJ(2024): By 2024, JNJ had separated the Consumer Health segment, indicating a strategic pivot away from that business line."

The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans.\n\nUnitedHealthcare's revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits, partially offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business. Earnings from operations decreased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business, partially offset by higher temporary deferral of care and growth in people served across our domestic businesses.\n\n## Optum\n\nTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows:\n\n## Optum Health\n\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based arrangements, acquisitions in care delivery and the impact of COVID-19 at our fee-based businesses as consumers resumed elective care. Earnings from operations increased due to the factors impacting revenues as well as cost management initiatives and increased investment income. COVID-19 related care costs and temporary care deferrals affected earnings from operations at our value-based and fee-based businesses in offsetting manners.

Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives.\n\n## Optum Rx\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain and cost management initiatives.

      "question": "What was the relationship between Thermo Fisher's increased depreciation expense from $986 million in 2022 to $1,068 million in 2023 and the declining revenues in its Life Sciences Solutions segment, which fell from $13,532 million to $9,977 million over the same period?",
      "answer": "The increased depreciation expense from $986 million in 2022 to $1,068 million in 2023 indicates higher capital investment, potentially in infrastructure or assets supporting long-term operations. However, during the same period, the Life Sciences Solutions segment experienced a significant revenue decline from $13,532 million to $9,977 million, suggesting that the additional capital investment did not immediately translate into revenue growth for this segment. This could signal a lag in realizing returns on capital expenditures or a strategic shift in focus. Furthermore, the segment income for Life Sciences Solutions also dropped from $5,582 million in 2022 to $3,420 million in 2023, reinforcing that the increased depreciation burden weighed on profitability despite\u2014or in combination with\u2014the revenue contraction.",

        "Hop 1: TMO(2022) \u2192 Consolidated depreciation: Depreciation expense was $986 million in 2022, indicating the company\u2019s capital investment base at that time.",
        "Hop 2: Consolidated depreciation \u2192 Life Sciences Solutions: Life Sciences Solutions accounted for $214 million of that $986 million depreciation in 2022, showing a significant portion of the company\u2019s capital investment was allocated to this segment.",
        "Hop 3: Life Sciences Solutions \u2190 TMO(2023): In 2023, Life Sciences Solutions' revenues declined to $9,977 million from $13,532 million in 2022, while its depreciation increased to $220 million, indicating a continued capital investment despite falling revenues."

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth's focus on home-based care initiatives like HouseCalls in 2024 relate to its continued service of 7.8 million individuals across both Medicaid (2023) and Medicare Advantage (2024), and what does this suggest about the scalability of its care delivery model across different senior and vulnerable populations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UnitedHealthcare Community & State served 7.8 million people through Medicaid and other state programs, including medically underserved and economically disadvantaged populations. In 2024, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement also served 7.8 million individuals through Medicare Advantage plans. The continuity in serving large, high-need populations across both programs suggests a scalable care delivery infrastructure. Furthermore, in 2024, the company expanded its HouseCalls program, delivering 2.9 million preventive home visits, which aligns with its strategic emphasis on home-based and digitally enabled care. This indicates that UnitedHealth is leveraging its existing infrastructure from Medicaid programs to support its growing Medicare Advantage business, particularly through enhanced home care services that address gaps in access and care continuity for seniors and vulnerable groups.",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in 'Non-segment activity' in the above table. A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. A nimal Health segment profits increased 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturingrelated costs, partially  offset by  increased administrativ e costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rate of 14.1% in 2024 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact due to a $519 million reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ initiated restructuring within its Innovative Medicine segment, exiting certain R&D programs in infectious diseases and vaccines (including RSV adult vaccine, hepatitis, and HIV development), resulting in $479 million in restructuring expenses. This strategic refocusing was intended to prioritize the most promising R&D investments. However, despite these cuts, JNJ reported a significant increase in R&D expense in 2024, specifically citing 'increased research and development to advance the pipeline' as a factor in the segment's margin pressures. This suggests that while JNJ reduced spending in certain therapeutic areas, it reallocated resources toward advancing high-potential programs, reflecting a shift in R&D investment strategy rather than an overall reduction. The 2024 R&D expense of $258 million (up from $2023\u2019s $258 million, which had already declined from $468 million in 2022) indicates a stabilization and refocusing of R&D investment rather than a simple cost-cutting measure.",

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&amp;D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV ) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV  development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2024 was recorded in Restructuring on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered development program costs, asset impairments and asset divestments. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments. Total project costs of approximately $0.6 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n32",

      "answer": "In 2022, Merck's Animal Health segment reported profits of $1,963 million, while in 2024, this figure was $1,938 million \u2014 indicating a slight decline in absolute profitability. However, this stability masks a key difference in how costs are allocated between segments. According to Merck's disclosures, Animal Health segment profits are calculated as segment sales less all cost of sales, as well as selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development costs directly incurred by the segment. In contrast, Pharmaceutical segment profits only include segment sales less standard costs and selling, general, and administrative expenses \u2014 excluding R&D costs. This reveals that Merck applies a more comprehensive cost allocation methodology to its Animal Health segment, incorporating R&D expenses directly into segment profits, which is not done for the Pharmaceutical segment. This distinction affects how each segment's true economic performance is represented in the financial reporting.",

Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

      "answer": "In 2023, Medtronic's Cardiovascular Portfolio was undergoing internal reorganization, with changes in segment structure due to the separation of the PMRI businesses and the wind-down of the Renal Care Solutions business, which was contributed to Mozarc Medical in April 2023. This reorganization continued into 2024, where the Cardiovascular Portfolio was explicitly structured into three divisions: Cardiac Rhythm & Heart Failure, Structural Heart & Aortic, and Coronary & Peripheral Vascular. The Structural Heart & Aortic division, as of 2024, focused on therapies for heart valve disorders and aortic disease, including specific product lines such as the CoreValve family of aortic valves (e.g., Evolut PRO, Evolut FX+ TAVR systems), surgical valve replacement products, and endovascular stent grafts like the Endurant II and Valiant Captivia systems. This level of segmentation and product specificity was not as clearly articulated in 2023, indicating a sharpened strategic focus in 2024.",

The decrease in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by increased utilization, the unfavorable impact of the Company's Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year and higher acuity in Medicaid. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in net investment income and improved fixed cost leverage across the business due to membership growth.\n\nThe following table summarizes the Health Care Benefits segment's medical membership as of December 31, 2024 and 2023:\n\n",

ACOs that achieve performance standards established by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services ('HHS') are eligible to share in a portion of the amounts saved by the Medicare program.\n\n## In-Home Health Evaluations\n\nAs a complement to its value-based care delivery, the Company operates a large mobile network of credentialed providers in the U.S. through its Signify Health business. These credentialed providers are deployed into the home primarily to conduct in-home health evaluations ('IHEs') and perform select diagnostic services. IHEs may also be performed virtually or at a healthcare provider facility. During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company performed more than 3 million IHEs. While in the home, providers perform IHEs with the assistance of the Company's longitudinal patient records and proprietary clinical workflow software with its integrated device hub. The Company's software guides clinical workflows as well as in-home diagnostic screenings, yielding a rich patient report of hundreds of data points. The Company also offers diagnostic and preventive services and provides comprehensive medication review services while in the home. Through its IHEs, the Company creates a comprehensive, documented record of the clinical, social and behavioral needs of its health plan customers' medically complex populations and seek to further engage them with the healthcare system.\n\nThe evaluation results of IHEs are provided to individuals' primary care physicians. The Company believes sharing these results helps to fill gaps in care, while encouraging individuals who have not regularly visited their PCP to schedule a visit. The IHEs also provide health plans with insights into member health without taking members out of the home and contribute to health plans' ability to effectively participate in value-based and risk-adjusted government programs such as Medicare Advantage. The data gathered during an IHE is also a resource that can be used by health plans to improve their Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set ('HEDIS') scores and Medicare Advantage star ratings.\n\n## MinuteClinic\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company operated more than 900 MinuteClinic locations in the U.S. The clinics are staffed by nurse practitioners and physician assistants who utilize nationally established guidelines to deliver a variety of health care services.

This contraction in operating income was primarily due to continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and reduced front store volume, including a 2.1% drop in same-store front store sales and lower contributions from OTC test kits post-public health emergency. Despite increased prescription volume and improved drug purchasing, the adjusted operating income was negatively impacted.

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "How did the strategic evolution of Optum Insight's service offerings in 2023, particularly around data and analytics for health systems and life sciences companies, contribute to Optum's ability to deliver $19.3 billion in dividends to UnitedHealth Group in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Optum Insight was described as delivering integrated services and solutions focused on advanced analytics, technology, and healthcare expertise to hospital systems, physicians, health plans, governments, and life sciences companies. This strategic positioning was aimed at improving performance, achieving efficiency, reducing costs, and modernizing core operating systems. By 2024, Optum Insight had further evolved its offerings, specifically enhancing its capabilities in administrative efficiency, payment simplification, and evidence-based clinical workflows for health systems, while expanding its support for life sciences companies in therapeutic discovery and clinical outcomes. These developments likely contributed to Optum\u2019s stronger financial performance, as evidenced by the $19.3 billion in dividends paid to UnitedHealth Group in 2024 \u2014 up from $18.5 billion in 2023. The evolution of Optum Insight\u2019s service offerings appears to have strengthened Optum\u2019s overall profitability and operational efficiency, enabling increased capital returns to the parent company.",

      "question": "Given that JNJ's 2022 capital expenditures for Medical Devices were $1,933 million and its 2024 MedTech R&D spending was $3,703 million, did the company shift strategic investment focus from infrastructure in Medical Devices to innovation-driven R&D in MedTech between those years?",
      "answer": "Yes, the data indicates a strategic shift from infrastructure investment in Medical Devices to R&D in MedTech. In 2022, JNJ spent $1,933 million on capital additions specifically for Medical Devices. By 2024, this focus had evolved into a $3,703 million R&D investment under the broader MedTech category, reflecting a 91.6% increase in allocated resources. This suggests a pivot from physical infrastructure to innovation and development within the same broader business segment.",

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities ('VIEs') for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company invests in short-term money market funds, commercial paper and time deposits, as well as other debt securities that are classified as cash equivalents within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as these funds are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nRestricted cash (included in other current assets) represents funds held on behalf of members, including health savings account ('HSA') funds associated with high deductible health plans. Beginning in 2021, the Company began presenting these funds held on behalf of members in restricted cash and, for statement of cash flow purposes, retrospectively adjusted the 2020 and 2019 balances by the amounts shown in the table below in the line item 'restricted cash (included in other current assets)' to conform with the current year presentation. Restricted cash (included in other assets) represents amounts held in a trust in one of the Company's captive insurance companies to satisfy collateral requirements associated with the assignment of certain insurance policies. All restricted cash is invested in time deposits, money market funds or commercial paper.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets to total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's Pharmacy Services segment reported a $1.2 billion increase in adjusted operating income, driven by improved purchasing economics and contributions from specialty pharmacy services, despite competitive pressures reducing rebate sharing. This growth in adjusted operating income positively impacted the Health Care Benefits segment in 2023, as evidenced by the $2,594 million in acquisitions reported under that segment, suggesting strategic reinvestment into expanding the business. This aligns with the overall increase in the Health Care Benefits segment's balance from $44,159 million in 2022 to $46,644 million in 2023, indicating that strong operating performance in 2022 supported strategic growth in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in Health Care Costs in 2023 ($210M from $249M in 2022) influence the Health Care Benefits segment\u2019s ability to manage utilization trends and premium deficiency reserves in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CVS reported a decrease in Health Care Costs from $249M in 2022 to $210M in 2023, a $39M decline. This reduction was partly due to lower completion factors in the Health Care Benefits segment, which led to a $55M decrease in health care costs payable in 2023 compared to $32M in 2022. By 2024, this trend appeared to influence the segment\u2019s financial positioning, as the company anticipated continued elevated utilization levels, which could pressure the Health Care Benefits segment and potentially trigger premium deficiency reserves in 2025. Thus, while lower health care costs in 2023 improved short-term cost management, the 2024 outlook suggests that sustained utilization pressures may offset these gains, highlighting a dynamic evolution in how cost trends feed into segment performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVS(2023) \u2192 Health Care Costs: Health care costs decreased from $249M in 2022 to $210M in 2023, a $39M drop.",
        "Hop 2: Health Care Costs \u2192 Health Care Benefits Segment: Lower completion factors in 2023 led to a $55M reduction in health care costs payable, compared to $32M in 2022, directly impacting the segment's cost structure.",
        "Hop 3: Health Care Benefits Segment \u2190 CVS(2024): In 2024, the segment faced continued elevated utilization, with the potential for premium deficiency reserves in 2025, indicating that earlier cost reductions may not be sufficient to offset emerging utilization pressures."

          "chunk_text": "## 2025 Outlook\n\nThe Company believes you should consider the following key business and regulatory trends and uncertainties:\n\n## Key Business Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company expects medical membership declines in its Medicare and individual exchange products. Medical membership disruptions may result in volatility in the Company's financial results.\n- Utilization persisted at elevated levels through the fourth quarter of 2024. Although the level of utilization is difficult to accurately predict, at this time, the Company expects that continued elevated utilization will pressure its Health Care Benefits segment and its health care delivery assets in its Health Services segment into 2025.\n- Increases in utilization beyond the Company's projections may also result in the Company having to record premium deficiency reserves within in the Health Care Benefits segment during 2025.\n- The Company's Medicaid business is experiencing medical cost pressures, largely driven by higher than expected acuity following the resumption of member redeterminations. While the Company continues to work closely with its state partners to ensure the underlying trends are reflected in its premium rates going forward, it is uncertain when these pressures will be fully offset by state rate updates.\n- The Company's individual exchange business is subject to a risk adjustment program whereby the Company estimates its ultimate risk adjustment receivable or payable based on the risk of its qualified plan members relative to the average risk of members of other qualified plans in comparable markets. Changes in the Company's risk relative to the markets' risk, including changes resulting from volatility in membership, could adversely impact the Company's estimate of its risk adjustment receivable or payable.\n- The Company continues to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread.' The Company expects these trends to continue.\n- Glucagon-like peptide 1 ('GLP-1') supply disruptions, and the associated impact on product mix, could pressure the Company's ability to deliver savings to clients and could impact the Company's results.\n- Regulatory changes or consumer sentiment shift for immunizations may negatively impact national demand impacting financial results.\n- Implementation of new tariffs create exposure for increased costs and supply chain disruptions that can adversely impact consumer demand or financial results.\n- Consumer spend management and a decline in consumer discretionary spending, as well as a shift to value, grocery and digital retailers, could drive lower front store sales.\n- Future financial performance will be influenced by a number of factors including competitive demand for products and services, legislative and regulatory considerations, and labor and other market dynamics, including inflation. The Company evaluates and adjusts its approach in each of the markets it serves, considering all relevant factors.\n- The Company expects benefits from ongoing enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives and investments in efficiencies, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. During the third quarter of 2024, the Company finalized an enterprise-wide restructuring plan intended to streamline and simplify the organization, improve efficiency and generate expected cost savings of over $500 million in 2025. Refer to Note 3 ''Restructuring'' for actions implemented under the plan.\n- Changes in conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect interest rates and capital market conditions which could result in increased financing costs.\n- Actions taken by ratings agencies, including changes in the Company's debt ratings, could impact the Company's future borrowing costs, access to capital markets and new store operating lease costs.\n\n## Key Regulatory Trends and Uncertainties\n\n- The Company is exposed to funding and regulation of, and changes in government policy with respect to and/or funding or regulation of, the various Medicare programs in which the Company participates, including changes in the amounts payable to us under those programs and/or new reforms or surcharges on existing programs, including changes to applicable risk adjustment mechanisms.\n- Legislation and/or regulations seeking to regulate PBM activities in a comprehensive manner have been proposed or enacted in a majority of states and on the federal level. This legislative and regulatory activity could adversely affect",

      "question": "The significant drop in CVS's Adjusted Operating Income from $17,534 million in 2023 to a $5.3 billion decrease in 2024 was partially offset by improved Net Investment Income. Given the company's exposure to U.S. capital market volatility, how did this reliance on Net Investment Income affect CVS's financial risk profile in 2024?",
      "answer": "CVS's Adjusted Operating Income declined by $5.3 billion in 2024, primarily driven by increased utilization, unfavorable Medicare Advantage star ratings, and higher Medicaid acuity. This decline was partially offset by improved Net Investment Income, which became a more critical component of financial stability. However, the 2024 filings highlight that adverse conditions in U.S. and global capital markets can significantly affect the value of CVS\u2019s investment portfolio, net investment income, and overall financial condition. This increased reliance on Net Investment Income exposed CVS to greater financial risk from market volatility, including potential realized or unrealized capital losses, reduced reinvestment yields, and fluctuating fair values of investments. Thus, while Net Investment Income helped cushion the drop in operating performance, it also heightened the company\u2019s sensitivity to capital market instability.",

If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).\n\nEstimated fair values could change if, for ex ample, there are changes in the business climate, industry-wide changes, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital ex penditure levels, operating cash flows or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results, which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\n## Adverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities, mortgage loans, alternative investments and other investments, and our operating results and/or our financial condition.\n\nThe U.S. and global capital markets, including credit markets, continue to experience volatility and uncertainty. As an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S., and to a lesser ex tent the international financial markets. V olatility, uncertainty and/or disruptions in the global capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments' monetary policy, particularly U.S. monetary policy, can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our operating results and/or our financial condition by:\n\n- significantly reducing the value and/or liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce our operating results and/or unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders' equity;\n- lowering interest rates on high-quality short-term or medium-term debt securities and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding securities;\n- reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise;\n- causing non-performance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties, including customers, issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, mortgage borrowers and/or reinsurance and/or derivatives counterparties;\n- making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for ex ample if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-to-period volatility in our net income and shareholders' equity;\n- reducing our ability to issue debt securities at attractive interest rates, thereby increasing our interest ex pense and decreasing our operating results; and\n- reducing our ability to issue other securities.\n\nAlthough we seek, within guidelines we deem appropriate, to match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to manage our credit and counterparty exposures, a failure to do so adequately could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and, in extreme circumstances, our cash flows.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Relationships with Manufacturers, Providers, Suppliers and Vendors\n\n## We face risks relating to the market availability, pricing, suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs and other products that we purchase and sell.\n\nOur Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment and our mail order and specialty pharmacy operations generate revenues in significant part by dispensing prescription drugs. Our PBM business generates revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. As a result, we are dependent on our relationships with prescription drug manufacturers and suppliers. We acquire a substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacies' prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers. Certain of our agreements with such suppliers are short-term and cancellable without cause. In addition, these agreements may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than us. Certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels.

      "question": "How did the shift in reporting retail co-payment revenue from the Pharmacy Services segment in 2022 to the Health Services segment in 2024 reflect a potential structural reorganization of CVS's business segments, and what might this indicate about the strategic alignment of pharmacy services within the broader health services offering?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CVS disclosed that the Pharmacy Services segment included $11.6 billion, $10.9 billion, and $11.5 billion of retail co-payments for 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively, indicating that co-payment revenue was historically tied to Pharmacy Services (Hop1). By 2024, the company reported that the Health Services segment included $11.4 billion, $13.7 billion, and $12.6 billion of retail co-payments for 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively, showing that co-payment revenue was now attributed to the Health Services segment (Hop3). This shift suggests a reclassification of revenue streams, potentially reflecting a strategic realignment where pharmacy services are more integrated into broader health services. The connection between Pharmacy Services Segment Revenue and Retail Co-Payments, as established in the 2022 filing (Hop2), supports this interpretation, indicating that the change in segment reporting likely reflects a broader organizational shift rather than a mere accounting adjustment.",

S ee Note 1 ''S ignificant Accounting Policies'' for additional information about retail co-payments.\n\n(2) Intersegment revenue eliminations relate to intersegment revenue generating activities that occur betw een the Health Care Benefits segment, the Health S ervices segment, and/or the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment.\n\n(3) Other segment items for each reportable segment includes operating expenses, w hich primarily consists of selling, general and administrative expenses. Other segment items excludes the impact of amortization of intangible assets and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance.\n\n(4) The Company's acquisition activities have resulted in the recognition of intangible assets as required under the acquisition method of accounting w hich consist primarily of trademarks, customer contracts/relationships, covenants not to compete, technology, provider netw orks and value of business acquired. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are tested for impairment w hen events indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The amortization of intangible assets is reflected in operating expenses w ithin each segment. Although intangible assets contribute to the Company's revenue generation, the amortization of intangible assets does not directly relate to the underw riting of the Company's insurance products, the services performed for the Company's customers or the sale of the Company's products or services. Additionally, intangible asset amortization expense typically fluctuates based on the size and timing of the Company's acquisition activity. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding the amortization of intangible assets enhances the Company's and investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance w ith its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends. Intangible asset amortization excluded from the related non-G AAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded w ithin the Company's G AAP financial statements, and the revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-G AAP financial measure. Intangible asset amortization is excluded from the related non-G AAP financial measure because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised.\n\n(5) The Company's net realized capital gains and losses arise from various types of transactions, primarily in the course of managing a portfolio of assets that support the payment of insurance liabilities. Net realized capital gains and losses are reflected in net investment income (loss) w ithin each segment. These capital gains and losses are the result of investment decisions, market conditions and other economic developments that are unrelated to the performance of the Company's business, and the amount and timing of these capital gains and losses do not directly relate to the underw riting of the Company's insurance products, the services performed for the Company's customers or the sale of the Company's products or services. Accordingly, the Company believes excluding net realized capital gains and losses enhances the Company's and investors' ability to compare the Company's past financial performance w ith its current performance and to analyze underlying business performance and trends.",

      "answer": "The completion of JNJ's Medical Devices restructuring program in 2022, which generated approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings, contributed to the overall cost optimization strategy that supported the company's financial flexibility in 2023. This allowed JNJ to strategically prioritize its Innovative Medicine R&D investments, leading to a 33.3% income before tax as a percent to sales in 2023, up from 29.8% in 2022. This shift was partially driven by exiting lower-priority programs such as the RSV adult vaccine, hepatitis, and HIV development, which resulted in a restructuring charge of $479 million in 2023. These actions reflect a reallocation of resources toward higher-potential therapeutic areas, leveraging the cost savings from earlier restructuring efforts in the Medical Devices segment.",

The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:\n\n- Recovery of prior year COVID-19 production related slow downs and related inventory impacts\n- Overall expense leveraging resulting from the Medical Devices sales recovery\n- Litigation expense of $0.1 billion in 2021 vs. $0.3 billion in 2020 partially offset by:\n- A contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in the fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition\n- A higher IPR&amp;D charge of $0.7 billion ($0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019)\n\nRestructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022.\n\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\n\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 8.3% in 2021 and 10.8% in 2020.\n\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2021 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity &amp; Cash Flows\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.5 billion at the end of 2021 as compared to $14.0 billion at the end of 2020.\n\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.5 billion increase were:\n\n",

This growth likely supported MRK's capacity to make a $4.0 billion upfront payment to Daiichi Sankyo in 2023 as part of a global development and commercialization agreement for three ADC candidates. The strong performance of the Animal Health segment, along with other business units, enabled MRK to structure a high-value partnership with profit-sharing terms, where the companies will equally share expenses and profits worldwide (excluding Japan), demonstrating how earlier-year segment performance can enable strategic investment in high-potential oncology assets.",

Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

The full  year  effective  income  tax  rate  reflects  a  favorable  mix  of  income  and  expense,  as  well  as  higher  foreign  tax  credits  from ordinary business operations that the Company was able to credit in 2021. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations in 2021 also reflects the beneficial impact of the settlement of a foreign tax matter, as well as a net tax benefit of $207 million related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). The effective income tax rate from continuing operations in 2021 also reflects the unfavorable effect of a charge for the acquisition of Pandion for which no tax benefit was recognized. The effective income tax rate in 2020 reflects the unfavorable impact of a charge for the acquisition of VelosBio for which no tax benefit was recognized. The effective income tax rate in 2019 reflects the favorable impact of a $106 million net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements) and the reversal of tax reserves established in connection with the 2014 divestiture of Merck's Consumer Care (MCC)  business  due  to  the  lapse  in  the  statute  of  limitations.  In  addition,  the  effective  income  tax  rate  in  2019  reflects  the unfavorable impact of a charge for the acquisition of Peloton for which no tax benefit was recognized and charges of $117 million related to the finalization of treasury regulations for the transition tax associated with the 2017 enactment of U.S. tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was $13 million in 2021, $4 million in 2020 and $(84) million in 2019. The loss in 2019 was driven primarily by the portion of goodwill impairment charges related to certain businesses in the Healthcare Services segment that were attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Non-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations\n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are alternative views of the Company's performance that Merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of the Company's results as it permits investors to understand how management assesses performance. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain items because of the  nature  of  these  items  and  the  impact  that  they  have  on  the  analysis  of  underlying  business  performance  and  trends.  The excluded items (which should not be considered non-recurring) consist of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs,  income  and  losses  from  investments  in  equity  securities  and  certain  other  items.  These  excluded  items  are  significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.\n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-GAAP EPS. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the Company along with other metrics. In addition, senior management's annual compensation is derived in part using non-GAAP pretax income. Since non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be  comparable  to  the  calculation  of  similar  measures  of  other  companies.  The  information  on  non-GAAP  income  and  nonGAAP  EPS  should  be  considered  in  addition  to,  but  not  as  a  substitute  for  or  superior  to,  net  income  and  EPS  prepared  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP).",

By 2024, livestock product sales growth increased to 4%, attributed to sustained higher pricing, continued demand for poultry and swine, and the addition of the Elanco aqua business acquired in July 2024.

      "question": "How did the negative impact of currency on JNJ's Surgery franchise sales evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the changing influence of foreign exchange fluctuations on MedTech segment performance?",
      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ's Surgery franchise sales were $9.8 billion, showing strong growth driven by market recovery and new product introductions. By 2024, Surgery franchise sales remained flat at $9.8 billion but reflected a 1.9% decline from 2023, with the decline partially attributed to negative currency impacts. In the broader MedTech segment in 2024, currency had a 1.4% negative impact on worldwide sales and a 2.8% negative impact on international sales. This indicates that while currency pressures became more pronounced at the segment level by 2024, the Surgery franchise specifically began to experience material headwinds from foreign exchange movements, which offset some of the underlying operational growth.",

By 2023, Aranesp sales were further impacted by lower net selling price and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates, with U.S. sales also declining due to reduced unit demand as dialysis organizations transitioned to EPOGEN.

      "answer": "In 2023, MRK's companion animal product sales grew 2%, primarily driven by higher pricing, with the Bravecto line of products contributing $1.1 billion in sales, representing a 4% increase compared to 2022. By 2024, the impact of higher pricing intensified, contributing to a 6% overall growth in companion animal product sales. The Bravecto product line maintained $1.1 billion in sales but grew by 6% year-over-year, or 8% excluding foreign exchange effects. This evolution in pricing impact was part of a broader strategy that included the acquisition of Elanco's aqua business in July 2024, which further expanded MRK's product portfolio and supported overall sales growth in the Animal Health segment. The pricing strategy thus not only sustained but amplified growth in companion animal products when compared to the prior year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, a 50 basis point decline in Pfizer's expected annual rate of return on plan assets led to a $133M increase in net periodic benefit costs, while in 2023, a similar 50 basis point decline resulted in a smaller $84M increase. This suggests that either the underlying pension plan asset base shrank between years, or other offsetting assumptions dampened the sensitivity of net periodic costs to the rate of return decline in 2023 compared to 2022.",

      "answer": "CVS experienced a 94.5% year-over-year drop in adjusted operating income in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by increased utilization, unfavorable Medicare Advantage star ratings, and higher Medicaid acuity. This steep decline significantly increased the company's reliance on net investment income, which partially offset the operating losses. However, the 2024 filings highlight several capital market risks that could jeopardize this financial strategy, including volatility in U.S. and global credit markets, falling interest rates that reduce yields on reinvested proceeds, and potential defaults by third parties on obligations to CVS.

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

If indicators of impairment are present, the Company first compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset group (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows used in this analysis are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss calculation is prepared. The impairment loss calculation compares the carrying amount of the asset group to the asset group's estimated future cash flows (discounted).\n\nEstimated fair values could change if, for ex ample, there are changes in the business climate, industry-wide changes, changes in the competitive environment, adverse legal or regulatory actions or developments, changes in capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital ex penditure levels, operating cash flows or market capitalization. Because of the significance of our goodwill and intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could require material noncash charges to our operating results, which also could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\n\n## Adverse conditions in the U.S. and global capital markets can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investments in debt and equity securities, mortgage loans, alternative investments and other investments, and our operating results and/or our financial condition.\n\nThe U.S. and global capital markets, including credit markets, continue to experience volatility and uncertainty. As an insurer, we have a substantial investment portfolio that supports our policy liabilities and surplus and is comprised largely of debt securities of issuers located in the U.S. As a result, the income we earn from our investment portfolio is largely driven by the level of interest rates in the U.S., and to a lesser ex tent the international financial markets. V olatility, uncertainty and/or disruptions in the global capital markets, particularly the U.S. credit markets, and governments' monetary policy, particularly U.S. monetary policy, can significantly and adversely affect the value of our investment portfolio, our operating results and/or our financial condition by:\n\n- significantly reducing the value and/or liquidity of the debt securities we hold in our investment portfolio and creating realized capital losses that reduce our operating results and/or unrealized capital losses that reduce our shareholders' equity;\n- lowering interest rates on high-quality short-term or medium-term debt securities and thereby materially reducing our net investment income and operating results as the proceeds from securities in our investment portfolio that mature or are otherwise disposed of continue to be reinvested in lower yielding securities;\n- reducing the fair values of our investments if interest rates rise;\n- causing non-performance of or defaults on their obligations to us by third parties, including customers, issuers of securities in our investment portfolio, mortgage borrowers and/or reinsurance and/or derivatives counterparties;\n- making it more difficult to value certain of our investment securities, for ex ample if trading becomes less frequent, which could lead to significant period-to-period changes in our estimates of the fair values of those securities and cause period-to-period volatility in our net income and shareholders' equity;\n- reducing our ability to issue debt securities at attractive interest rates, thereby increasing our interest ex pense and decreasing our operating results; and\n- reducing our ability to issue other securities.\n\nAlthough we seek, within guidelines we deem appropriate, to match the duration of our assets and liabilities and to manage our credit and counterparty exposures, a failure to do so adequately could adversely affect our net income and our financial condition and, in extreme circumstances, our cash flows.\n\n## Risks Related to Our Relationships with Manufacturers, Providers, Suppliers and Vendors\n\n## We face risks relating to the market availability, pricing, suppliers and safety profiles of prescription drugs and other products that we purchase and sell.\n\nOur Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment and our mail order and specialty pharmacy operations generate revenues in significant part by dispensing prescription drugs. Our PBM business generates revenues primarily by contracting with clients to provide prescription drugs and related health care services to plan members. As a result, we are dependent on our relationships with prescription drug manufacturers and suppliers. We acquire a substantial amount of our mail order and specialty pharmacies' prescription drug supply from a limited number of suppliers. Certain of our agreements with such suppliers are short-term and cancellable without cause. In addition, these agreements may allow the supplier to distribute through channels other than us. Certain of these agreements also allow pricing and other terms to be adjusted periodically for changing market conditions or required service levels.

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "How did the Analytical Instruments segment's contribution to TMO's segment income performance evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this reveal about management's strategic focus on this segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Analytical Instruments segment reported $1,197 million in segment income, reflecting its role as a consistent contributor to TMO's profitability. By 2024, management placed increased emphasis on segment income as a core metric for strategic planning, particularly highlighting how it informs decisions around 'changes in selling prices, strategic growth investments, productivity, and business mix.' This evolution indicates a shift toward more strategic utilization of the Analytical Instruments segment, which provides tools used across diverse markets including pharmaceutical, environmental, and clinical labs. The 2024 disclosures show that segment income is now more closely tied to strategic levers like innovation and productivity, suggesting that the segment's financial performance is being leveraged more directly in shaping TMO's long-term direction.",

A portion of the company's euro-denominated senior notes, certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and its cross-currency interest rate swaps have been designated as, and are effective as, economic hedges of part of the net investment in a foreign operation. Accordingly, foreign currency transaction gains or losses due to spot rate fluctuations on the euro-denominated debt instruments and certain foreign currency-denominated payables, and contract fair value changes on the cross-currency interest rate swaps, excluding interest accruals, are included in currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive items and shareholders' equity.\n\nSee Note 1 and Note 3 for additional information on the company's risk management objectives and strategies.\n\n## Note 11.    Business Segment and Geographical Information\n\nThe company's financial performance is reported in four segments. A description of each segment follows.\n\nLife Sciences Solutions: provides an extensive portfolio of reagents, instruments and consumables used in biological and medical research, discovery and production of new drugs and vaccines as well as diagnosis of infection and disease. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, agricultural, clinical, healthcare, academic, and government markets.\n\nAnalytical Instruments: provides a broad offering of instruments and the supporting consumables, software and services that are used for a range of applications in the laboratory and in the field. These products and services are used by customers in pharmaceutical, biotechnology, academic, government, environmental and other research and industrial markets, as well as the clinical laboratory.\n\nSpecialty Diagnostics: offers a wide range of diagnostic test kits, reagents, culture media, instruments and associated products to serve customers in healthcare, clinical, pharmaceutical, industrial, and food safety laboratories. Our healthcare products are used to increase the speed and accuracy of diagnoses, which improves patient care in a more cost-efficient manner.\n\nLaboratory Products and Biopharma Services: offers virtually everything needed for the laboratory. Our unique combination of self-manufactured and sourced products and extensive service offering enables our customers to focus on their core activities and helps them to be more innovative, productive and cost-efficient. The segment also includes a comprehensive offering of outsourced services used by the pharmaceutical and biotech industries for drug development, clinical research, clinical trials services and commercial drug manufacturing.\n\nThe company's management evaluates segment operating performance based on operating income before certain charges/credits to cost of revenues and selling, general and administrative expenses, restructuring and other costs, and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets. The company uses this measure because it helps management understand and evaluate the segments' core operating results and facilitates comparison of performance for determining compensation.\n\nThe company's president, chairman and chief executive officer is its chief operating decision maker (CODM). The CODM uses total revenues and segment income predominantly in the strategic plan, annual operating plan and quarterly business review processes. During these processes, the CODM considers budget-to-actual variances to evaluate both internal (e.g., changes in selling prices, strategic growth investments, productivity, business mix , newly acquired/divested businesses, etc.) and ex ternal (e.g., inflation, foreign currency, etc.) events and conditions.\n\nThe company generally accounts for intersegment revenues at current market prices.\n\nOther segment items included in the below tables consist of stock-based compensation and other incentive compensation expenses, allocations of corporate expenses and certain overhead expenses as well as elimination of intersegment and intrasegment profits, all of which are included in the company's measurement of segment income, but not regularly provided to the CODM at the segment level. Cost of revenues adjustments consist of charges for the sale of inventories revalued at the date of acquisition, inventory write-downs associated with large-scale abandonments of product lines, and accelerated depreciation on fixed assets to estimated salvage value in connection with the consolidation of operations. Selling, general and administrative adjustments consist of significant transaction/integration costs (including reimbursement thereof) related to recent/terminated acquisitions, charges/credits for changes in estimates of contingent acquisition consideration, and charges related to product liability litigation. Restructuring and other costs include charges arising from headcount reductions and facility consolidations such as severance and abandoned lease expense and gains and losses on the sale of real estate and",

      "question": "UnitedHealth Group's operating margin declined from 8.3% in 2022 to 7.7% in 2024. How did Optum's segment performance and capital distribution dynamics influence this margin contraction over the two-year period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UNH reported an operating margin of 8.3%, with Optum contributing $11.995 billion in earnings from operations at a 7.7% operating margin. By 2024, UNH\u2019s consolidated operating margin had decreased to 7.7%, reflecting a continuation of margin pressure in Optum\u2019s operations. This was driven by sustained low-margin performance in Optum Health (8.3% in 2022) and Optum Rx (4.5% in 2022), which collectively diluted the consolidated margin. Additionally, capital distributions from Optum to the parent company increased to $19.3 billion in 2024, indicating a strategic shift toward returning value to the parent rather than reinvesting in margin-enhancing initiatives. Thus, both Optum\u2019s segment-level profitability and its capital flow strategy contributed to the overall operating margin contraction from 2022 to 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ's Pharmaceutical segment reported $0.6 billion in divestiture gains, clearly tied to its legacy structure. In 2023, following a segment reorganization, these gains were no longer attributed to 'Pharmaceutical' but instead appeared under the newly named 'Innovative Medicine' segment. Despite the consistent $0.6 billion in divestiture gains in both years, the reclassification in 2023 suggests a strategic shift to align divestiture activities more closely with innovation-focused portfolio management. This realignment indicates that divestitures are increasingly being used to fund or support the growth of innovative therapeutic areas under the new segment structure.",

      "question": "How did Merck's Keytruda sales performance and evolving pricing strategy in Argentina contribute to the company's overall revenue growth in 2024, especially in light of the Argentine peso devaluation and the expiration of certain royalty obligations that were in place through 2023?",
      "answer": "Merck's Keytruda sales were a key driver of revenue growth in 2024, with global sales increasing by 18% (22% excluding foreign exchange effects). In Argentina, the devaluation of the peso negatively impacted foreign exchange by approximately 2 percentage points, but this was largely offset by inflation-related price increases, a practice consistent with local market norms. In 2022, Merck was still under a 6.5% royalty obligation on Keytruda sales, which was set to decline to 2.5% in 2024 through 2026. This reduction in royalty burden improved gross margins on Keytruda sales, supporting profitability even as the company adjusted pricing in response to inflationary pressures in Argentina. Thus, the combination of strong demand across new and earlier-stage indications and strategic pricing in high-inflation markets helped sustain Keytruda\u2019s growth trajectory and contributed significantly to Merck\u2019s 7% (10% ex-FX) total revenue growth in 2024.",

        "Hop 2: Keytruda Sales \u2192 Inflation-Related Price Increases: In 2024, Keytruda sales growth was supported by inflation-adjusted pricing in Argentina, which helped offset FX headwinds.",
        "Hop 3: Inflation-Related Price Increases \u2190 MRK(2024): The Argentine peso devaluation created FX pressure, but inflation-linked pricing helped maintain revenue growth, especially for high-performing products like Keytruda."

          "chunk_text": "\nIn March 2021, Merck announced it was voluntarily withdrawing the U.S. indication for Keytruda for the treatment of patients with metastatic small-cell lung cancer with disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and at least one other  prior  line  of  therapy.  The  withdrawal  of  this  indication  was  done  in  consultation  with  the  FDA  and  does  not  affect  other indications for Keytruda . As announced in January 2020, KEYNOTE-604, the confirmatory Phase 3 trial for this indication, met one  of  its  dual  primary  endpoints  of  progression-free  survival  but  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  for  the  other  primary endpoint of overall survival.\n\nIn 2022, Merck initiated the withdrawal of the U.S. accelerated approval indication for Keytruda for  the treatment of patients with recurrent locally advanced or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma whose tumors express PD-L1, with disease progression on or after two or more prior lines of therapy. The decision was made in consultation with the FDA following the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee evaluation of this third-line gastric cancer indication for Keytruda as a monotherapy because it failed to meet its post-marketing requirement of demonstrating an overall survival benefit in a Phase 3 study. The withdrawal of this indication does not affect other indications for Keytruda .\n\nThe Company is a party to certain third-party license agreements pursuant to which the Company pays royalties on sales of Keytruda .  Under the terms of the more significant of these agreements, Merck pays a royalty of 6.5% on worldwide sales of Keytruda through 2023 to one third party; this royalty will decline to 2.5% for 2024 through 2026 and will terminate thereafter. The Company pays an additional 2% royalty on worldwide sales of Keytruda to another third party, the termination date of which varies by country; this royalty will expire in the U.S. in 2024 and in major European markets in 2025. The royalties are included in Cost of sales .\n\nLynparza is an oral poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with AstraZeneca  (see  Note  5  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements).  Lynparza  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  certain  types  of advanced ovarian, breast, pancreatic and prostate cancers. Alliance revenue related to Lynparza grew 36% in 2021 and 63% in 2020 due to continued uptake across the multiple approved indications in the U.S., Europe, Japan and China. In June 2021, Lynparza was granted conditional approval in China as monotherapy for the treatment of certain previously treated adult patients with germline or somatic BRCA -mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer based on the results of the PROfound trial.\n\nLenvima is an oral receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor being developed as part of a collaboration with Eisai (see Note 5 to the  consolidated  financial  statements).  Lenvima  is  approved  for  the  treatment  of  certain  types  of  thyroid  cancer,  HCC,  in combination with everolimus for certain patients with RCC, and in combination with Keytruda both for the treatment of certain patients with endometrial carcinoma and for the treatment of certain patients with RCC. Alliance revenue related to Lenvima grew 21% in 2021 and 44% in 2020 primarily due to higher demand in the U.S. and China.\n\nGlobal sales of Emend (aprepitant), for the prevention of certain chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, declined 13% in 2021 reflecting lower volumes in Europe and China.

The Keytruda clinical development program includes studies across a broad range of cancer types.\n\nGlobal sales of Keytruda grew 18% in 2024, or 22% excluding the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. The negative impact of foreign exchange was primarily due to the devaluation of the A rgentine peso, which was largely offset by inflation-related price increases consistent with practice in that market. Keytruda sales growth in the U.S. reflects higher demand across the multiple approved metastatic indications, in particular for the treatment of certain types of bladder, endometrial, microsatellite instability-high (M SI-H) and renal cell cancers, as well as increased uptake across earlier-stage indications, including in certain types of high-risk early-stage triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), NSCLC and RCC, and higher pricing. Keytruda sales growth in international markets reflects higher demand predominately for the TNBC, melanoma and RCC earlier-stage indications, as well as uptake in cervical, gastric and renal cell cancer metastatic indications. The Company expects that the 2025 launch and reimbursement of new indications for Keytruda in the EU will have a negative impact on pricing in those markets.\n\nSummarized below are the Keytruda regulatory approvals received in 2024 and, to date, in 2025.\n\n",

      "answer": "MRK's Pharmaceutical Segment profits increased from $36,852 million in 2022 to $44,533 million in 2024, reflecting a strategic emphasis on valuing intangible assets through a rigorous income approach that considers probability-adjusted future net cash flows. In 2022, MRK disclosed using discounted projected net cash flows to value intangible assets, incorporating risk profiles, development stages, and probability of success. This methodology guided investment decisions in R&D, particularly for in-process research and development (IPR&D), which were capitalized as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion. By 2024, the resulting product pipeline advancements and commercialization efficiencies were directly tied to higher segment profits. The non-allocation of Merck Research Laboratories\u2019 human health-related R&D expenses from segment profits further highlights a strategic separation that supports focused investment in high-potential intangible assets, contributing to the $7.7B profit increase over two years.",

The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Part II Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.' Readers are cautioned the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nDiscussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## General\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two businesses:\n\n- Optum Health;\n- Optum Insight;\n- Optum Rx; and\n- UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State.\n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, 'Business' and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Change Healthcare Cyberattack\n\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers.\n\nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser ex tent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\n\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals' information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.",

      "answer": "TMO's Analytical Instruments segment revenue increased from $6.07B in 2022 to $7.26B in 2023, while the segment income rose significantly from $1.20B to $1.91B. This indicates a strong improvement in profitability, as the segment income margin increased from approximately 19.8% in 2022 to 26.3% in 2023.

      "answer": "In 2022, Johnson & Johnson projected $1,421 million in retirement plan benefit payments for 2024, indicating a growing obligation. However, by 2024, the company reported a -$2 million curtailment and settlement amount, suggesting a reduction or reversal in liabilities. This implies that JNJ may have taken actions to reduce its future pension obligations, such as restructuring or settling portions of the retirement plans, which offset the previously projected increase in payments. The shift from a $1,317 million obligation in 2022 to a -$2 million settlement in 2024 reflects a strategic pivot in managing retirement liabilities.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Danaher reported $1.141 billion in net actuarial gains for defined benefit plans, driven by favorable asset returns exceeding expectations and higher discount rates. These gains positively impacted the company's pension obligations and were a key component of other comprehensive income. By 2023, Danaher's pension funding policy explicitly referenced considerations of 'underlying asset returns' and 'funded status' when determining contribution levels. This indicates that the strong asset returns contributing to the 2021 actuarial gains had a lasting influence on how the company approached pension funding decisions in 2023, integrating actual performance outcomes into updated policy assumptions.",

      "question": "How did the change in CVS's Pharmacy Services Segment revenue composition from retail co-payments in 2022 compare to the 2023 Health Services Segment disclosures, and what does this indicate about the evolution of their pharmacy revenue model?",
      "answer": "In 2022, the Pharmacy Services Segment reported $11.6 billion in retail co-payments for 2021, $10.9 billion for 2020, and $11.5 billion for 2019 as part of its total revenues. These co-payments were a key component of the segment's financial structure. By 2023, the company reorganized its reporting segments, and the successor Health Services Segment disclosed $13.7 billion in retail co-payments for 2023, $12.6 billion for 2022, and $11.6 billion for 2021. This indicates a consistent growth in retail co-payment contributions from 2019 to 2023, with an increase of over $2 billion in reported values between 2019 and 2023.

The expense recognized for these plans was $425 million in 2024, $398 million in 2023 and $474 million in 2022. AbbVie provides certain other post-employment benefits, primarily salary continuation arrangements, to qualifying employees and accrues for the related cost over the service lives of the employees.\n\n## Note 13 Equity\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nIn May 2021, stockholders of the company approved the AbbVie Amended and Restated 2013 Incentive Stock Program (the Amended Plan), which amends and restates the AbbVie 2013 Incentive Stock Program (2013 ISP). AbbVie grants stock-based awards to eligible employees pursuant to the Amended Plan, which provides for several different forms of benefits, including non-qualified stock options, RSUs and various performance-based awards. Under the Amended Plan, a total of 144 million shares of AbbVie common stock have been reserved for issuance as awards to AbbVie employees.\n\nAbbVie measures compensation expense for stock-based awards based on the grant date fair value of the awards and the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. Forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience at the time of grant and are revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. Compensation cost for stock-based awards is amortized over the service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible. Retirement eligible employees generally are those who are age 55 or older and have at least 10 years of service.\n\n2024 Form 10-K\n\n",

      "question": "How did the restructuring charges disclosed in JNJ's 2022 financials relate to the Innovative Medicine segment's restructuring-related costs in 2024, and what does this imply about the company's strategic focus in its pharmaceutical operations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ disclosed a restructuring charge of $0.1 billion related to its operations, signaling early signs of strategic repositioning. By 2024, the Innovative Medicine segment specifically reported a restructuring-related charge of $0.1 billion, indicating that the company continued to allocate resources toward streamlining its pharmaceutical operations. This continuity in restructuring efforts suggests a sustained strategic focus on optimizing the Innovative Medicine segment, potentially aligning with earlier restructuring initiatives seen in 2022. The segment's pre-tax income dropped significantly from $479 million in 2023 to $102 million in 2024, reflecting the financial impact of these ongoing adjustments.",

(6)\n\n## 18. Acquisitions and Divestitures\n\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company did not make any material acquisitions.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2020, certain businesses were acquired for $7.3 billion in cash and $0.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\n\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $7.5 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\n\nThe fiscal year 2020 acquisitions primarily included: all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc. (XBiotech), Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Momenta), a company that discovers and develops novel therapies for immune-mediated diseases and the outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities.\n\nDuring the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all rights to the investigational compound bermekimab, which has multiple dermatological indications, along with certain employees from XBiotech Inc., for a purchase price of $0.8 billion. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&amp;D, for $0.8 billion applying a probability of success factor that ranged from 20% to 60% to reflect inherent development, regulatory and commercial risk for the different indications. The discount rate applied was approximately 16%. XBiotech may be eligible to receive additional payments upon the receipt of certain commercialization authorizations. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment. On January 28, 2022, subsequent to the fiscal year 2021, additional information regarding efficacy became available which led the Company to the decision to terminate the development of bermekimab for Atopic Dermatitis (AD). The Company recorded an intangible asset impairment charge of approximately $0.6 billion related to an in-process research and development asset, bermekimab (JnJ-77474462), an investigational drug for the treatment of AD and Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS). The impairment charge is related to the AD indication and is a nonrecognized subsequent event and will be reflected in the first quarter 2022 financial statements. The Company acquired all rights to bermekimab from XBiotech, Inc. in fiscal year 2020.\n\nAdditionally, in the fiscal first quarter of 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of all outstanding shares in Verb Surgical Inc., a company with significant robotics and data science capabilities, including those shares previously held by Verily. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Medical Devices segment. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets, primarily IPR&amp;D, for $0.4 billion, goodwill for $0.2 billion, other assets of $0.2 billion and liabilities assumed of $0.3 billion. The fair value of the Company's previously held equity investment in Verb Surgical Inc. was $0.4 billion.\n\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of Momenta for a purchase price of approximately $6.1 billion, net of cash acquired. The fair value of the acquisition was allocated primarily to non-amortizable intangible assets (IPR&amp;D) of $6.0 billion, goodwill of $1.2 billion, other assets of $0.5 billion and liabilities of $1.6 billion. The assets acquired are intended to address substantial unmet medical need in maternal-fetal disorders, neuro-inflammatory disorders, rheumatology, dermatology and autoimmune hematology. Depending on the asset, probability of success factors ranging from 20% to 77% were used in the fair value calculation to reflect inherent development and regulatory risk of the IPR&amp;D. The discount rate applied was approximately 13%. The goodwill is primarily attributable to synergies expected to arise from the business acquisition and is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. The transaction was accounted for as a business combination and included in the Pharmaceutical segment.\n\nDuring fiscal year 2019 certain businesses were acquired for $5.8 billion in cash and $1.4 billion of liabilities assumed. These acquisitions were accounted for using the acquisition method and, accordingly, results of operations have been included in the financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition.\n\nThe excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of tangible assets acquired amounted to $6.8 billion and has been assigned to identifiable intangible assets, with any residual recorded to goodwill.\n\nThe fiscal year 2019 acquisitions primarily included DR. CI:LABO, a Japanese company focused on the marketing, development and distribution of a broad range of dermocosmetic, cosmetic and skincare products and Auris Health, Inc. a",

This indicates that although Optum experienced significant revenue growth in 2023, the drop in operating margin from 7.7% to 7.0% limited the proportional increase in earnings from operations, resulting in a more modest $1.887 billion (13%) increase in earnings compared to the prior year.",

      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ's amortization of prior service cost for Retirement Plans was $184 million, contributing to a net periodic benefit cost of $676 million. This cost remained flat in 2024 at $184 million, but the net periodic benefit cost decreased significantly to $222 million, indicating a change in the relationship between amortization and overall benefit cost. This suggests that other factors, such as actuarial gains or changes in service cost, played a larger role in reducing the net periodic benefit cost in 2024.",

      "question": "How did the changes in the Health Care Benefits segment's product mix in 2023 influence the evolution of CVS's Health Care Costs Payable estimates in 2024, particularly in terms of IBNR reserve adjustments?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Health Care Benefits segment faced margin pressures due to a shift in product mix toward less profitable products like ASC and government-sponsored programs, which reduced the segment's profitability. This shift impacted the segment's ability to manage health care cost liabilities effectively. In 2023, the segment observed higher-than-expected completion factors, resulting in a $55 million decrease in health care costs payable compared to prior estimates. By 2024, the company refined its IBNR reserve estimation process, incorporating updated actuarial assumptions around claim submission patterns and medical cost trends. The audit process for 2024 highlighted increased scrutiny on the actuarial best estimate, including sensitivity analyses around completion factors and cost trends, reflecting a more cautious and data-intensive approach to managing health care costs payable in response to the 2023 dynamics.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVS(2023) \u2192 Health Care Benefits Segment: The segment experienced margin pressures due to a shift in product mix toward less profitable products like ASC and government-sponsored programs, reducing profitability.",
        "Hop 2: Health Care Benefits Segment \u2192 Health Care Costs Payable: In 2023, higher-than-expected completion factors led to a $55 million decrease in health care costs payable related to prior-year estimates.",
        "Hop 3: Health Care Costs Payable \u2190 CVS(2024): By 2024, the company enhanced its IBNR estimation methodology, incorporating actuarial sensitivity analyses and tighter controls over assumptions like completion factors and medical cost trends."

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's liability for health care costs payable includes estimated payments for (1) services rendered to members but not yet reported and (2) claims that have been reported but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively, 'IBNR'). The estimated IBNRliability is developed utilizing actuarial principles and assumptions that include historical and projected claimsubmission and processing patterns, historical and assumed medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claiminventory levels, changes in membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors to record the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management's actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. In particular, the estimate is sensitive to the assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. |\n|                                            | Auditing management's actuarial best estimate of IBNRreserves for health care costs payable within the Health Care Benefits segment involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management's assumptions used in the valuation process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit   | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process for estimating IBNRreserves.

Segment disclosures are on a performance basis consistent with internal management reporting. The chief operating decision maker (CODM) at Abbott is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO). The CODM primarily considers sales and operating margin to assess the performance of segments and to allocate resources, where segment operating margin profitability includes cost of products sold and operating expenses. The cost of some corporate functions and the cost of certain employee benefits are charged to segments at predetermined rates that approximate cost.  Remaining costs, if any, are not allocated to segments.  In addition, intangible asset amortization is not allocated to operating segments, and intangible assets and goodwill are not included in the measure of each segment's assets.",

By 2024, adjusted operating income had decreased by $189 million (3.2%), largely due to declining front store sales (-2.1%) and ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures.

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "answer": "In 2023, UNH had a stake in Optum Rx, which contributed $5,115 million to earnings from operations. By 2024, this contribution increased to $5,836 million, a rise of $721 million. Despite this increase, UNH's consolidated operating margin slightly declined from 8.7% in 2023 to 8.1% in 2024. This indicates that while Optum Rx improved its operational performance, other segments or corporate-level costs offset the positive impact on the overall operating margin.",

      "answer": "In 2022, a 2% increase in market interest rates resulted in a $8,664 million decrease in the fair value of UnitedHealth Group's financial liabilities, while in 2023, the same 2% increase led to a slightly smaller decrease of $8,142 million. This indicates that the sensitivity of financial liabilities to interest rate increases slightly decreased year-over-year, suggesting a potential reduction in interest rate risk exposure or a change in the composition of the liabilities. The relationship between fair value of financial liabilities and market interest rates remained inverse, as expected in both years.",

      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ's Innovative Medicine segment reported $11.963 billion in sales, up from $11.642 billion in 2022, reflecting a growth in revenue. This growth in the Innovative Medicine segment was accompanied by an increase in capital investment, as evidenced by Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment rising from $1.653 billion in 2023 to $1.710 billion in 2024. The 3.4% year-over-year increase in segment sales appears to have supported a corresponding 3.5% increase in capital expenditures, suggesting a strategic alignment where revenue growth in Innovative Medicine was reinvested into infrastructure and production capabilities to sustain future growth.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS reported a $1.2 billion increase in adjusted operating income, primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and increased contributions from its group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy. This metric was directly tied to intersegment eliminations, as shown in the 2022 financial table where adjusted operating income included a $708 million deduction for intersegment eliminations. By 2024, intersegment eliminations had grown significantly to $47,585 million, reflecting a substantial increase in internal segment revenues and integration activities. This evolution suggests that CVS's internal business segments became more interconnected over time, with greater internal revenue flows that required larger eliminations during consolidation. The growth from $708 million to $47,585 million in intersegment eliminations indicates a transformation in how the company's segments interacted and contributed to overall operating performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ reported an expected return on plan assets of $2,756 million for its retirement plans, which decreased to $2,716 million in 2023. This $40 million decline in expected returns contributed to a significant change in the net periodic benefit cost, which went from a credit of $62 million in 2022 to a credit of $676 million in 2023. The reduction in returns, combined with increases in interest costs and actuarial losses, reflects a growing financial burden on the company's retirement obligations over this period.",

        "Hop 1: JNJ(2022) \u2192 Retirement Plans: JNJ disclosed projected future benefit payments, including $1,386 million for 2023, showing the ongoing financial commitment to these plans.",
        "Hop 2: Retirement Plans \u2192 Exp Return on Plan Assets: The expected return on plan assets for 2022 was $2,756 million, indicating the projected earnings from investments funding the retirement obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment contributed $7.26 billion to CVS's adjusted operating income, reflecting its significant role in the company's financial performance. However, in 2024, this segment experienced a 3.2% decline in adjusted operating income, driven by reduced front store sales (down 2.1% same-store sales) and ongoing pharmacy reimbursement pressures, despite a 12.3% increase in pharmacy same-store sales driven by prescription volume growth. The earlier year's strong contribution set a high baseline, making the 2024 decline more pronounced and indicating a shift in the segment's profitability trajectory due to external market pressures and reduced consumer demand in non-pharmacy categories.",

        "Hop 3: Adjusted Operating Income \u2190 CVS(2024): Adjusted operating income declined by 3.2% in 2024, partly due to reduced front store sales and pharmacy reimbursement pressures."

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "How did changes in the Health Care Benefits segment's product mix in 2023 influence the evolution of CVS's IBNR liabilities in 2024, particularly in light of the sensitivity of these liabilities to shifts in membership and utilization patterns?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Health Care Benefits segment faced margin pressures due to a shift in product mix toward lower-margin offerings such as government-sponsored programs and ASC products, which historically have lower profitability than Insured Health Care Benefits. This shift increased the segment's exposure to risk factors like adverse selection and utilization volatility. By 2024, the IBNR liabilities\u2014developed using actuarial assumptions including completion factors and medical cost trends\u2014showed sensitivity to these very same factors, with completion factors in prior years having caused a $55 million decrease in health care costs payable in 2023. The 2024 disclosures emphasize the high degree of subjectivity in estimating IBNR, particularly in relation to membership changes and utilization trends, suggesting that the 2023 product mix shift likely contributed to increased complexity and uncertainty in managing IBNR liabilities in 2024.",

As discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company's liability for health care costs payable includes estimated payments for (1) services rendered to members but not yet reported and (2) claims that have been reported but not yet paid, each as of the financial statement date (collectively, 'IBNR'). The estimated IBNRliability is developed utilizing actuarial principles and assumptions that include historical and projected claimsubmission and processing patterns, historical and assumed medical cost trends, historical utilization of medical services, claiminventory levels, changes in membership and product mix, seasonality and other relevant factors to record the actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. There is significant uncertainty inherent in determining management's actuarial best estimate of health care costs payable. In particular, the estimate is sensitive to the assumed completion factors and the assumed health care cost trend rates. |\n|                                            | Auditing management's actuarial best estimate of IBNRreserves for health care costs payable within the Health Care Benefits segment involved a high degree of subjectivity in evaluating management's assumptions used in the valuation process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit   | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the process for estimating IBNRreserves.

      "answer": "In 2022, DHR reported operating profit margins of 28.3%, but this dropped to 21.8% in 2023, a decline of 650 basis points. One of the primary drivers of this decline was the negative impact from lower core sales, product mix, and notably, inventory charges, which collectively accounted for 575 basis points of the decrease. Inventory charges in 2023 were specifically tied to reduced leverage in the company's operational and administrative cost structure. This reflects a deterioration in how inventory management affected profitability year-over-year, signaling potential issues in demand forecasting, product mix alignment, or inventory write-downs that directly eroded operating margins.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer updated its discount rate assumptions for defined benefit plans to reflect higher market rates for high-quality fixed-income investments, which led to an increase in the valuation of pension obligations (PFE_10k_2022.pdf). By 2024, this change, along with other actuarial updates, contributed to a $396 million actuarial gain in U.S. pension plans, as higher discount rates reduced the present value of future benefit obligations (PFE_10k_2024.pdf). Supporting this relationship, CVX_10k_2024.pdf confirms that higher discount rates generally result in lower benefit obligations due to the inverse relationship between discount rates and present value calculations. This implies that Pfizer's long-term pension liabilities may be decreasing in valuation, assuming sustained higher discount rates, which could reduce future funding requirements.",

We revise these assumptions based on an annual evaluation of long-term trends as well as market conditions that may have an impact on the cost of providing retirement benefits.\n\nThe weighted-average discount rate for our U.S. defined benefit plans is determined annually and evaluated and modified to reflect at year-end the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality fixed income investments, rated AA/Aa or better that reflect the rates at which the pension benefits could be effectively settled. For our international plans, the discount rates are set by benchmarking against investment grade corporate bonds rated AA/Aa or better, including, when there is sufficient data, a yield curve approach. These rate determinations are made consistent with local requirements. Overall, the yield curves used to measure the benefit obligations at year-end 2021 resulted in higher discount rates as compared to the prior year.\n\nThe following provides the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions for our U.S. postretirement benefit plans:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ's MedTech segment reported an income before tax as a percent to sales of 16.2%. By 2023, this metric had decreased to 15.4%, primarily due to a $0.5 billion increase in amortization expense linked to the Abiomed acquisition and a $0.4 billion expense from an acquired in-process R&D asset from the Laminar acquisition. Additionally, restructuring activities in the MedTech segment, including the $319 million pre-tax restructuring expense in 2023 related to the Orthopaedics franchise streamlining, contributed to the decline. These pressures were partially offset by litigation settlements and lower acquisition integration costs.",

The increase in the income before tax as a percent to sales was primarily driven by the following:\n\n- Recovery of prior year COVID-19 production related slow downs and related inventory impacts\n- Overall expense leveraging resulting from the Medical Devices sales recovery\n- Litigation expense of $0.1 billion in 2021 vs. $0.3 billion in 2020 partially offset by:\n- A contingent consideration reversal of approximately $1.1 billion in the fiscal 2020 related to the timing of certain developmental milestones associated with the Auris Health acquisition\n- A higher IPR&amp;D charge of $0.7 billion ($0.9 billion in 2021 related to the general surgery offering in digital robotics (Ottava) acquired with the Auris Health acquisition in 2019)\n\nRestructuring: In the fiscal second quarter of 2018, the Company announced plans to implement actions across its Global Supply Chain that are intended to enable the Company to focus resources and increase investments in critical capabilities, technologies and solutions necessary to manufacture and supply its product portfolio of the future, enhance agility and drive growth. The Company expects these supply chain actions will include expanding its use of strategic collaborations, and bolstering its initiatives to reduce complexity, improving cost-competitiveness, enhancing capabilities and optimizing its network.  Discussions regarding specific future actions are ongoing and are subject to all relevant consultation requirements before they are finalized. In total, the Company expects these actions to generate approximately $0.6 to $0.8 billion in annual pre-tax cost savings that will be substantially delivered by the end of 2022. The Company expects to record pre-tax restructuring charges of approximately $2.1 to $2.3 billion. The Company estimates that approximately 70% of the cumulative pre-tax costs will result in cash outlays. In 2021, the Company recorded a pre-tax charge of $0.5 billion, which is included on the following lines of the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, $0.3 billion in restructuring, $0.1 billion in other (income) expense and $0.1 billion in cost of products sold. Total project costs of approximately $1.8 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program is set to be completed at the end of 2022.\n\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details related to the restructuring programs.\n\nProvision for Taxes on Income: The worldwide effective income tax rate was 8.3% in 2021 and 10.8% in 2020.\n\nFor discussion related to the fiscal 2021 provision for taxes refer to Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity &amp; Cash Flows\n\nCash and cash equivalents were $14.5 billion at the end of 2021 as compared to $14.0 billion at the end of 2020.\n\nThe primary sources and uses of cash that contributed to the $0.5 billion increase were:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Corporate & Other segment reported an adjusted operating loss of $1.6 billion, as disclosed in the 2023 filing. Despite this loss, CVS's total adjusted operating income in 2023 reached $17.5 billion, indicating that other segments\u2014such as Health Care Benefits and Pharmacy Services\u2014likely contributed significant gains to offset the Corporate & Other segment's underperformance.

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated 35 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumerdirected health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs, Medicaid health care management services and health information technology products and services. The Health Care Benefits segment also provided workers' compensation administrative services through its Coventry Health Care Workers' Compensation business ('Workers' Compensation business') prior to the sale of this business on July 31, 2020. The Health Care Benefits segment's customers include employer groups, individuals, college students, part-time and hourly workers, health plans, health care providers ('providers'), governmental units, government-sponsored plans, labor groups and expatriates. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy. In addition, through the Pharmacy Services segment, the Company provides specialty pharmacy and infusion services, clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Pharmacy Services segment's clients are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, plans offered on Public Exchanges and private health insurance exchanges, other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the United States and Covered Entities. The Pharmacy Services segment operates retail specialty pharmacy stores, specialty mail order pharmacies, mail order dispensing pharmacies, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Retail/LTC Segment\n\nThe Retail/LTC segment sells prescription drugs and a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise, provides health care services through its MinuteClinic walk-in medical clinics, provides medical diagnostic testing, administers vaccinations for illnesses such as influenza, COVID-19 and shingles and conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy consulting and other ancillary services to long-term care facilities and other care settings. As of December 31, 2021, the Retail/LTC segment operated more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 MinuteClinic locations as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies. \u00ae",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS incurred $132M in acquisition-related integration costs, which were directly tied to the Corporate & Other segment and reflected ongoing post-acquisition integration efforts. These costs negatively impacted the segment's operating performance, contributing to its GAAP loss of $1,641M. By 2024, these integration costs were no longer present, suggesting a completion or stabilization of integration activities. This reduction likely improved the segment's operational clarity and allowed for a strategic refocus, particularly as the Corporate & Other segment continued to face exposure from legal risks such as qui tam lawsuits, as noted in the 2024 10-K filing.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company's segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for 24%, 19% and 18%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company's segments to the consolidated totals:",

      "answer": "In 2023, a 2% increase in Market Interest Rate led to a $3,642 million decrease in the Fair Value of Financial Assets, while in 2024, the same 2% increase resulted in a larger $4,151 million decrease. This indicates that UnitedHealth Group's Fair Value of Financial Assets became more sensitive to rising interest rates in 2024 compared to 2023, suggesting an increase in interest rate risk exposure. The negative impact intensified as the Fair Value loss grew by $509 million (from $3,642M to $4,151M) under the same interest rate scenario, reflecting a stronger inverse relationship between Market Interest Rate and Fair Value of Financial Assets over time.",

      "question": "How did the decline in UnitedHealthcare's earnings from operations between 2022 and 2024 impact the company's overall operating margin, and what does this suggest about the segment's ability to manage cost pressures relative to its revenue growth?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealthcare reported earnings from operations of $14,379 million on revenues of $249,741 million, yielding an operating margin of 5.8%. By 2024, earnings from operations had decreased to $15,584 million, despite an increase in revenues to $298,208 million, resulting in a lower operating margin of 5.2%. This represents a decline in margin from 5.8% to 5.2% over the two-year period, indicating that the segment faced increasing cost pressures that outpaced revenue growth. While revenues grew by $48,467 million (19.4%), earnings only increased by $1,205 million (8.4%), suggesting that UnitedHealthcare experienced rising operating costs or pricing pressures that limited its ability to convert additional revenue into profit. This trend raises concerns about the segment's operational efficiency and cost management strategies over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ's Medical Devices segment reported $1,933 million in Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment, a slight decrease from $1,980 million in 2021. However, in 2023, this figure rose significantly to $2,372 million, representing a substantial increase from the previous year's level. This shift from a declining trend to growth in capital expenditures suggests a renewed or intensified investment strategy in the Medical Devices segment, potentially signaling strategic expansion or modernization of facilities and production capabilities in this business area.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Pharmacy Services segment reported an Adjusted Operating Income of $6,859 million, reflecting stable performance over recent years. By 2024, despite a strong 12.3% increase in pharmacy same store sales driven by a 6.8% rise in prescription volume and branded GLP-1 drugs, Adjusted Operating Income decreased by $189 million, or 3.2%, primarily due to continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and lower front store volume. This indicates that while prescription volume and pharmacy sales grew, external pricing pressures and reduced front store contributions offset these gains, leading to a decline in profitability. The evolution of the relationship between the Pharmacy Services segment and Adjusted Operating Income shows a transformation from stable performance in 2022 to a decline in 2024 due to operational headwinds.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "How did Johnson & Johnson's pre-tax income from the Medical Devices segment in 2019 relate to its 2024 R&D investment allocation, and what does this suggest about the long-term strategic focus on innovation within that segment?",
      "answer": "In 2019, Johnson & Johnson reported $7,286 million in income before tax from the Medical Devices segment (2022 10-K filing), indicating strong historical profitability in this area. By 2024, the company allocated $3,703 million (11.6% of sales) to R&D for Medical Devices, representing a 14.2% increase over the prior year. This suggests that despite a decline in pre-tax income from 2019 to 2022 (down to $4,373 million in 2022), JNJ maintained or potentially increased its strategic emphasis on innovation in Medical Devices, as evidenced by rising R&D investment in 2024. The sustained high level of R&D spending relative to segment profitability indicates a long-term innovation strategy aimed at revitalizing growth in this historically profitable business area.",

By 2024, Optum's earnings from operations rose slightly to $16,703 million, yet UNH's consolidated earnings from operations declined from $32,358 million in 2023 to $32,287 million in 2024. This suggests that while Optum's performance improved year-over-year, its contribution was not sufficient to offset declines elsewhere in UNH\u2019s portfolio, such as the drop in UnitedHealthcare's earnings from $16,415 million to $15,584 million. The relationship between UNH\u2019s stake in Optum and consolidated earnings thus reflects a stabilizing but not growth-enhancing dynamic during this period.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's Retail/LTC segment was negatively impacted by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, which was expected to persist and affect performance. By 2024, this pressure had a measurable effect, partially offsetting a 12.3% increase in pharmacy same-store sales driven by a 6.8% rise in prescription volume and the influence of branded GLP-1 drugs. Despite higher prescription volumes, pharmacy reimbursement pressure contributed to a $189 million (3.2%) decline in adjusted operating income in 2024 compared to 2023. This evolution shows that while prescription volume and drug mix improved, the ongoing reimbursement pressure increasingly constrained profitability over time.",

          "chunk_text": "## Outlook for 2022\n\nWith respect to 2022, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:\n\n- The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare and Commercial membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in its Medicaid products. The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.\n- The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company's minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.\n- The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:\n- Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,\n- Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and\n- Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.\n- The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company's businesses.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the 'Government Regulation' section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company's businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.\n\nThe Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see 'Risk Factors' included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the 'Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements' in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.",

The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

These include, among others, the topics listed below. See also the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Regulatory Environment--Pipeline Productivity\n\nOur product lines must be replenished to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for earnings growth. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&amp;D activities which, while essential to our growth, incorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially. We conduct clinical trials to provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a product's overall benefit-risk profile for a particular patient population. In addition, after a product has been approved or authorized and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients. This includes postmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety concerns and take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a product's labeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the market. The commercial potential of in-line products may be negatively impacted by post-marketing developments.\n\n## Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights\n\nThe loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2022 through 2025. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.\n\nFor additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1. Business--Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see Note 16A1.\n\n## Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access--Government and Other Payer Group Pressures\n\nThe pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be important to payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Federal and state governments and private third-party payers in the U.S. continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines and vaccines. Within the U.S., we often engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers, including PBMs and MCOs. The price that patients pay in the U.S. for prescribed medicines and vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including proposing pricing reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, 'international reference pricing' (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, there is proposed legislation that, if enacted, would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for certain prescription drugs, as well as require that penalties be paid by manufacturers who raise drug prices faster than inflation. Also, certain changes proposed by the CMS in December 2020 to the Medicaid program and 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and increase the discounts we extend to 340B covered entities if they go into effect. Additional changes to the 340B program are undergoing review and their status is unclear. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures globally.

This strategic focus is reflected in the capital expenditures for the Medical Devices segment, which saw Additions to Property and Equipment increase from $604 million in 2023 to $630 million in 2024.

By 2024, the Animal Health segment faced heightened risk due to its increasing dependence on Bravecto, which accounted for 19% of the segment's sales. This evolution suggests that while the segment was stable in 2022, by 2024 it had become more vulnerable to product-specific risks, which could have implications for how earlier profit contributions (like from Eisai) were offset by new exposure to volatility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Negative events in the animal health industry could have a material adverse effect on future results of operations and financial condition of the Company or its Animal Health business.\n\nFuture sales of key animal health products could be adversely affected by a number of risk factors including certain risks that are specific to the animal health business. For example, the outbreak of disease carried by animals, such as A vian Influenza or A frican Swine Fever, could lead to their widespread death and precautionary destruction as well as the reduced consumption and demand for animals, which could adversely affect the Company's results of operations. Also, the outbreak of any highly contagious diseases near the Company's main production sites could require the Company to immediately halt the manufacture of its animal health products at such sites or force the Company to incur substantial expenses in procuring raw materials or products elsewhere. Other risks specific to animal health include epidemics and pandemics affecting livestock, government procurement and pricing practices, weather and global agribusiness economic events. In addition, in 2024, sales of Bravecto were $1.1 billion, which represented 19% of the Company's A nimal Health segment sales. A ny negative event with respect to Bravecto could have a material adverse effect on the Company's A nimal Health sales. If the A nimal Health segment of the Company's business becomes more significant, the impact of any such events on future results of operations could also become more significant.\n\n## Biologics and vaccines carry unique risks and uncertainties, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's future results of operations and financial condition.\n\nThe successful development, testing, manufacturing and commercialization of biologics and vaccines, particularly human and animal health vaccines, is a long, complex, expensive and uncertain process. There are unique risks and uncertainties related to biologics and vaccines, including:\n\n- There may be limited access to, and supply of, normal and diseased tissue samples, cell lines, pathogens, bacteria, viral strains and other biological materials. In addition, government regulations in multiple jurisdictions, such as the U.S. and the EU, could result in restricted access to, or transport or use of, such materials. If the Company loses access to sufficient sources of such materials, or if tighter restrictions are imposed on the use of such materials, the Company may not be able to conduct research activities as planned and may incur additional development costs.\n- The development, manufacturing and marketing of biologics and vaccines are subject to regulation by the FDA , the EM A  and other regulatory bodies. These regulations are often more complex and extensive than the regulations applicable to other pharmaceutical products. For example, in the U.S., a BLA , including both preclinical and clinical trial data and extensive data regarding the manufacturing procedures, is required for human vaccine candidates, and FDA approval is generally required for the release of each manufactured commercial human vaccine lot.\n- Manufacturing biologics and vaccines, especially in large quantities, is complex and may require the use of innovative technologies to handle living micro-organisms. Each lot of an approved biologic and vaccine must undergo thorough testing for identity , strength, quality , purity and potency . Manufacturing biologics requires facilities specifically designed for and validated for this purpose, and sophisticated quality assurance and quality control procedures are necessary . Slight deviations anywhere in the manufacturing process, including filling, labeling, packaging, storage and shipping, and quality control and testing, may result in lot failures, product recalls or spoilage. When changes are made to the manufacturing process, the Company may be required to provide preclinical and clinical data showing the comparable identity , strength, quality , purity or potency of the biologics and vaccines before and after such changes.\n- Biologics and vaccines are costly to manufacture because production ingredients are derived from living animal or plant material, and most biologics and vaccines cannot be made synthetically . In particular, keeping up with the demand for vaccines may be difficult due to the complexity of producing vaccines.\n- The use of biologically derived ingredients can lead to variability in the manufacturing process and could lead to allegations of harm, including infections or allergic reactions, which allegations would be reviewed through a standard investigation process that could lead to closure of product facilities due to possible contamination. A ny of these events could result in substantial costs.",

      "answer": "In 2023, DHR experienced a 11.5% decrease in total segment sales, primarily due to lower core sales\u2014especially in molecular diagnostics tests for COVID-19. This decline in core sales was a major contributor to the 660 basis point drop in operating profit margins, accounting for 635 basis points of the decline, due to reduced leverage in operational and administrative cost structures. By 2024, the negative impact of lower core sales persisted, contributing to a further 245 basis point decline in operating profit margins year-over-year. However, this was partially offset by the favorable impact of 2023 impairment charges, which reduced the overall margin decline to 170 basis points in 2024. The chain shows a continuation of pressure from core sales weakness, but with some relief from prior-year charges.",

        "Hop 2: Lower Core Sales \u2192 Operating Profit Margins: The drop in core sales led to reduced leverage in cost structure, negatively impacting operating profit margins by 635 basis points in 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Operating Profit Margins \u2190 DHR(2024): In 2024, lower core sales again negatively impacted operating profit margins by 245 basis points, but prior-year impairment charges offset some of the decline, resulting in a 170 basis point overall drop."

      "answer": "In 2022, Optum Insight had a $22.4 billion backlog in long-term arrangements, indicating a strong pipeline of multi-year contracts focused on administrative efficiency and analytics. By 2024, Optum Insight was explicitly credited with helping health plans reduce administrative costs through technology-enabled risk and quality services, including payment integrity solutions. UnitedHealthcare, in turn, cited increased use of Optum Insight\u2019s capabilities to manage financial performance and reduce complexity. This suggests that the execution of the 2022 backlog directly contributed to measurable administrative cost efficiencies in 2024, particularly in areas like payment accuracy and compliance, which are central to UnitedHealthcare's cost containment strategies.",

Some of our Optum businesses also provide services to payers participating in government health care programs. A reduction or less than expected increase, or a protracted delay, in government funding for these programs or change in allocation methodologies, or termination of the contract at the option of the government, has affected and in future periods may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nThe government health care programs in which we participate are generally subject to frequent changes, including changes which may reduce the number of persons enrolled or eligible for coverage (such as Medicaid eligibility redeterminations in certain states), reduce the amount of reimbursement or payment levels, reduce our participation in, or prevent our ex pansion into, certain service areas or markets, or increase our administrative or medical costs under such programs. Revenues for these programs depend on periodic funding from the federal government or applicable state governments and allocation of the funding through various payment mechanisms. Funding for these government programs depends on many factors outside of our control, including general economic conditions and budgetary constraints at the federal or applicable state level. For ex ample, CMS in the past has reduced or frozen Medicare Advantage benchmarks and additional cuts to Medicare Advantage benchmarks are possible. In addition, from time to time, CMS makes changes to the way it calculates Medicare Advantage risk adjustment payments. Although we have adjusted members' benefits and premiums on a selective basis, ceased to offer benefit plans in certain counties, and intensified both our medical and operating cost management in response to the benchmark reductions and other funding pressures, these or other strategies may not fully address the funding pressures in the Medicare Advantage program. In addition, payers in the Medicare Advantage program may be subject to reductions in payments from CMS as a result of decreased funding or recoupment pursuant to government audit. States have also made changes in rates and reimbursements for Medicaid members and audits can result in unexpected recoupments.\n\nUnder the Medicaid managed care program, state Medicaid agencies solicit bids from eligible health plans to continue their participation in the acute care Medicaid health programs. If we are not successful in obtaining renewals of state Medicaid managed care contracts, we risk losing the members who were enrolled in those Medicaid programs. Under the Medicare Part D program, to qualify for automatic enrollment of low income members, our bids must result in an enrollee premium below a regional benchmark, which is calculated by the government after all regional bids are submitted. If the enrollee premium is not below the government benchmark, we risk losing the members who were auto-assigned to us and will not have additional members auto-assigned to us. Chronic failure to meet the benchmarks could result in termination of these government contracts. In general, our bids are based upon certain assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs and other factors. If any of these assumptions are materially incorrect, either as a result of unforeseen changes to the programs on which we bid, implementation of material program or policy changes after our bid submission, or submissions by our competitors at lower rates than our bids, our results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nMany of the government health care coverage programs we participate in are subject to the prior satisfaction of certain conditions or performance standards or benchmarks. For example, as part of the ACA, CMS has a system providing various quality bonus payments to Medicare Advantage plans meeting specified quality star ratings at the individual plan or local contract level. The star rating system considers various measures adopted by CMS, including, among others, quality of care, preventive services, chronic illness management, handling of appeals and customer satisfaction. Plans must have a rating of four stars or higher to qualify for bonus payments, and CMS has and may make changes to the star rating program that impact the ability of plans to achieve four-star or higher ratings. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our star ratings, our plans may not be eligible for quality bonuses and we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans and the number of people we serve. Any changes in standards or care delivery models applying to government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or our inability to maintain or improve our quality scores and star ratings to meet evolving government performance requirements or to match the performance of our competitors could result in limitations to our participation in or ex clusion from these or other government programs, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nCMS uses various payment mechanisms to allocate funding and adjust monthly capitation payments for Medicare programs. For Medicare Advantage plans, these adjustments are made according to the predicted health status of each beneficiary as supported by data from health care providers. For Medicare Part D plans, payment adjustments are driven by risk-sharing provisions based on a comparison of costs forecasted in our annual bids to actual prescription drug costs. Some state Medicaid programs utilize a similar process.

In 2023, while Adjusted Operating Income increased to $17,534 million from $18,037 million (a slight decrease), there was no specific line item for Intersegment Eliminations in the comparable 2023 reporting table. This suggests that either the eliminations were absorbed differently across segments or no longer required separate disclosure, indicating a possible evolution in how CVS internally allocates or manages intersegment activity. This change could reflect improved segment alignment, a shift in internal transfer pricing, or simplification of intersegment transactions.",

This increase in gains suggests that the company's assumptions or actual experience related to these plans improved over the year, potentially reflecting favorable changes in discount rates, mortality assumptions, or plan participation trends.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Johnson & Johnson reported its Consumer Health segment generating $1,294M in income before tax for 2021. Following the separation of the Consumer Health business in Q3 2023, JNJ restructured its operations into two reportable segments: Innovative Medicine and MedTech. By 2024, the company no longer reported Consumer Health as a separate segment and instead focused on segment income before tax for Innovative Medicine and MedTech to allocate resources and assess performance.

      "answer": "The increase in risk-free interest rates from 1.83% in 2022 to 3.60% in 2023 contributed to a rise in MDT's weighted average grant date fair value of stock options from $39.94 to $46.23 per share. This reflects the sensitivity of the Black-Scholes valuation model to interest rate assumptions. Simultaneously, MDT's U.S. pension interest costs rose from $102 million in 2022 to $142 million in 2023, aligning with the higher risk-free interest rates, which are used to discount pension liabilities. Thus, the same macroeconomic factor (risk-free interest rates) influenced both equity compensation expenses and pension liabilities across the two years.",

Despite growth in other Optum divisions, the drop in Optum Insight's earnings placed downward pressure on the overall Optum segment and, by extension, UnitedHealth Group's consolidated earnings from operations, which remained relatively flat at $32,287 million in 2024 compared to $32,358 million in 2023.",

      "answer": "Amgen's experience with declining net selling prices for ENBREL in 2022, where pricing pressures were driven by benefit plan changes and increased co-pay expenses, appears to have directly shaped its approach to managing Repatha's sales dynamics in 2024. In response to payer-imposed restrictions and affordability issues impacting Repatha, Amgen proactively reduced the net price of Repatha by offering greater discounts and rebates to payers. This included introducing new National Drug Codes (NDCs) to make Repatha available at a lower list price, aiming to reduce patient abandonment due to high co-pays. Despite these efforts, payer restrictions and formulary limitations continued to constrain Repatha sales in 2024. While global Repatha sales increased by 43% in volume, this growth was partially offset by a 10% decline in net selling price, echoing the pricing pressures Amgen had previously faced with ENBREL in 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "expected to continue to have, a negative impact on the Company's product sales, business and results of operations. Louisiana, Arkansas, West V irginia, Minnesota, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Maryland have enacted laws with mandates on manufacturers participating in the 340B Program, and, in 2024, no fewer than 25 states considered similar legislation. These bills vary, but typically include provisions on restricting a manufacturer's ability to direct drugs in 340B channels, recognizing 340B contract  pharmacies and a prohibition on requiring the inclusion of 340B claims modifiers.  In  March 2024, the  U.S.  Court of Appeals for the 8th  Circuit ruled that Arkansas' Act 1103, which prohibits drugmakers from restricting the acquisition or delivery of 340B drugs to covered entities and their contract pharmacies, was not preempted by the federal 340B statute. The decision contributed to an increase in the number of states considering similar legislation. In July 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi denied motions for a preliminary injunction in two cases challenging a similar law in Mississippi, finding that neither plaintiff had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. These orders are being appealed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. In September 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana dismissed a lawsuit challenging Louisiana's 340B contract pharmacy mandate law, and the U.S. District Court for the  District of  Maryland denied a motion for preliminary injunction challenging a similar law in Maryland. These lawsuits challenging states on their 340B contract pharmacy laws are subsequent to Genesis Health Care, Inc. v. Becerra, where the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina issued an order in November 2023 that enjoins the Health Resources and Services Administration from enforcing its more restrictive interpretation of who is considered a patient under the 340B Program, to the potential benefit of healthcare systems seeking to expand the application of 340B discounts.\n\nAdditionally, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized Florida to move forward with its importation program proposal, though the state has not completed any significant steps towards importation within the one-year authorization window. Colorado, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and V ermont have also enacted state importation laws, and some have submitted plans for approval to the FDA. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs.\n\nUltimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\n\n## -U.S. commercial payer actions have affected, and may continue to affect, access to and sales of our products\n\nPayers, including healthcare insurers,  PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from consolidations of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, are continuing to seek ways to further reduce their costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients' use of manufacturer commercial co-pay assistance programs. Further, government regulation of payers may affect these trends. Payers, including PBMs, have sought, and continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, and to also impose restrictions on access to, or usage of, our products (such as Step Therapy), require that patients receive the payer's prior authorization before covering the product, and/or chosen to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha has been prescribed meet their utilization criteria, and these requirements have served to limit patient access to Repatha treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers (including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans), and in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha prescriptions rather than paying their co-pay, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha available at a lower list  price.  However,  affordability  of  patient  out-of-pocket  co-pay  cost  has  limited,  and  may  continue  to  limit,  patient  use.  Further,  despite  these  net  and  list  price reductions, some payers have restricted, and may continue to restrict, patient access and may seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions, such as changing formulary coverage for Repatha, that could reduce its sales. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, negatively affecting Repatha sales.\n\nFurther, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in  the  United  States,  the  FTC's  interim  report  released  in  2024  showed  that  the  top  six   integrated  health  plans  and  PBMs  controlled  about  94%  of  all  pharmacy prescriptions. This high degree of consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mailorder pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers from our business. Each of CVS, Express Scripts and United Health G roup (among the top six integrated health plans and PBMs) have Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their leverage to negotiate deeper discounts on their behalf and for the benefit of their other customers. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage changes, plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse",

      "answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, TMO's consolidated depreciation increased from $658 million to $831 million, with a significant portion of that increase tied to the Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment, whose depreciation expense rose from $342 million in 2022 to $423 million in 2024. This indicates that the segment bore a growing share of the company's overall depreciation burden, likely due to increased capital investments or asset acquisitions during that period. Despite this increased expense, the segment remained a major contributor to consolidated revenues, suggesting that the investment was either strategic or necessary to maintain competitive positioning in the biopharma services market.",

      "answer": "CVS's Health Services segment grew significantly from $23.6B in 2022 to $34.1B in 2023 due to acquisitions and realignment, which positively impacted Adjusted Operating Income in 2023 at $6.49B. However, by 2024, Adjusted Operating Income declined by 3.2% year-over-year, primarily due to pharmacy reimbursement pressure and reduced front store volume, including the absence of contributions from expired COVID-19 OTC test kits. This indicates that while the Health Services expansion initially boosted profitability, external pressures and market conditions in 2024 began to erode those gains.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "question": "How did changes in Merck's assumptions about the expected life of financial instruments from 2021 to 2024 impact their fair value disclosures, particularly in relation to derivative assets and liabilities?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck disclosed fair value measurements for derivative assets like forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps, totaling $549 million for 2021. At that time, the expected life of these instruments was reported as a range (4.2\u20135.4 years). By 2024, Merck had shifted to reporting a fixed expected life of 5.8 years. This change from a range to a precise value suggests increased confidence in forecasting instrument lifespan, which likely contributed to more stable or predictable fair value estimates. The narrowing of assumptions may have influenced the consistency of derivative valuations, potentially reducing volatility in reported fair values over time.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's Adjusted Operating Income in the Pharmacy Services segment was negatively impacted by price compression and increased client rebate sharing, despite growth in pharmacy claims and improved purchasing economics. By 2024, the Health Services segment reported $173.6 billion in total revenues and $7.2 billion in adjusted operating income, showing a slight decline from 2023's $7.3 billion but reflecting continued strategic investments, including $10.3 billion in acquisitions in 2023. The capital allocation to Health Services remained stable at $34.066 billion in 2024, indicating sustained focus on this segment despite slight operating income pressures. The evolution shows a shift from cost-driven pharmacy services to growth-oriented health services, supported by strategic M&A and consistent capital investment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVS(2022) \u2192 Adjusted Operating Income: Adjusted operating income increased by $1.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by improved purchasing economics and specialty pharmacy services, but faced downward pressure from price compression and rebate sharing.",
        "Hop 2: Adjusted Operating Income \u2192 Health Services: In 2022, the Health Services segment reported $6.8 billion in adjusted operating income, which slightly increased to $7.3 billion in 2023 and then slightly declined to $7.2 billion in 2024, indicating a mature but stable performance.",
        "Hop 3: Health Services \u2190 CVS(2024): The Health Services segment maintained a capital allocation of $34.066 billion in 2024, unchanged from 2023, reflecting continued strategic emphasis despite slight operating income moderation."

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's Health Care Benefits segment projected a decrease in its Medical Benefit Ratio (MBR) compared to 2021, driven by improved pricing and reduced COVID-19-related medical costs, although the pandemic still had a net negative impact. By 2023, however, the MBR\u2014especially in segments like COBRA\u2014was identified as a risk factor that could significantly negatively impact operating results, particularly due to unanticipated increases in health care costs and volatility in medical cost trends. This shift indicates that while MBR was expected to improve in 2022, it became a source of financial risk in 2023 due to changing cost dynamics and external pressures such as economic conditions and regulatory constraints.",

The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.\n- The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company's minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.\n- The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:\n- Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,\n- Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and\n- Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.\n- The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company's businesses.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the 'Government Regulation' section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company's businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.\n\nThe Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see 'Risk Factors' included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the 'Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements' in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.",

These acquisitions increased the segment\u2019s capacity to deliver value-based care and manage pharmacy benefit solutions more effectively. The Health Services segment also launched Cordavis, a subsidiary focused on biosimilar development and commercialization, which directly engaged in negotiating pharmaceutical pricing and rebates on behalf of its clients. By 2024, the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment showed increased dependency on pharmaceuticals, as evidenced by its continued role in dispensing prescriptions across more than 9,000 retail locations and its expanded specialty pharmacy services.

Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), is a leading health solutions company building a world of health around every consumer it serves and connecting care so that it works for people wherever they are. As of December 31, 2024, the Company had more than 9,000 retail locations, more than 1,000 walk-in and primary medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 90 million plan members and expanding specialty pharmacy solutions, and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than 800,000 patients per year. The Company also serves an estimated more than 36 million people through traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including expanding Medicare Advantage offerings and a leading standalone Medicare Part D prescription drug plan ('PDP'). The Company is creating new sources of value through its integrated model allowing it to ex pand into personalized, technology driven care delivery and health services, increasing access to quality care, delivering better health outcomes and lowering overall health care costs.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers. The Health Care Benefits segment has the information and resources to help members, in consultation with their health care professionals, make more informed decisions about their health care. The Health Care Benefits segment offers a broad range of traditional, voluntary and consumer-directed health insurance products and related services, including medical, pharmacy, dental and behavioral health plans, medical management capabilities, Medicare Advantage and Medicare Supplement plans, PDPs and Medicaid health care management services. The Health Care Benefits segment's primary customers, its members, primarily access the segment's products and services through employer groups, government-sponsored plans or individually. The Health Care Benefits segment also serves customers who purchase products and services that are ancillary to its health insurance products. The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' The Company sold Insured plans directly to individual consumers through the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in 17 states as of December 31, 2024.\n\n## Health Services Segment\n\nThe Health Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, delivers health care services in its medical clinics, virtually, and in the home, and offers provider enablement solutions. PBM solutions include plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services, and specialty and mail order pharmacy services. In addition, the Company provides clinical services, disease management services, medical spend management and pharmacy and/or other administrative services for providers and federal 340B drug pricing program covered entities ('Covered Entities'). The Company operates a group purchasing organization that negotiates pricing for the purchase of pharmaceuticals and rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of its participants and provides various administrative, management and reporting services to pharmaceutical manufacturers. During 2023, the Company completed the acquisition of two key health care delivery assets - Signify Health, Inc. ('Signify Health'), a leader in health risk assessments, valuebased care and provider enablement services, and Oak Street Health, Inc. ('Oak Street Health'), a leading multi-payor operator of value-based primary care centers serving Medicare eligible patients. The Company also launched Cordavis , a wholly owned subsidiary that works directly with pharmaceutical manufacturers to commercialize and/or co-produce high quality biosimilar products. The Health Services segment's clients and customers are primarily employers, insurance companies, unions, government employee groups, health plans, PDPs, Medicaid managed care plans, the U.S. Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services ('CMS'), plans offered on public and private health insurance exchanges and other sponsors of health benefit plans throughout the U.S., patients who receive care in the Health Services segment's medical clinics, virtually or in the home, as well as Covered Entities. TM\n\n## Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment dispenses prescriptions in its retail pharmacies and through its infusion operations, provides ancillary pharmacy services including pharmacy patient care programs, diagnostic testing and vaccination administration, and sells a wide assortment of health and wellness products and general merchandise. The segment also conducts long-term care pharmacy ('LTC') operations, which distribute prescription drugs and provide related pharmacy",

      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ reported a recognized actuarial loss of $199 million for retirement plans, contributing to a net periodic benefit cost (credit) of $(676) million. By 2024, this shifted to a recognized actuarial gain of $174 million for retirement plans, which helped reduce the net periodic benefit cost (credit) to $(222) million. This change in actuarial position had a cascading effect on other benefit plans, where the net periodic benefit cost (credit) increased from $487 million in 2023 to $530 million in 2024, reflecting a more favorable actuarial environment.",

By 2024, the same 1% increase resulted in a more pronounced decline of $4,828 million.

Management also uses this non-GAAP financial measure to measure the Company's operating and financial performance and as one of the performance measures in the Company's executiv e short-term cash incentiv e program. The Company excludes the effect of currency translation from this measure because currency translation is not under management's control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends, and excludes the effect of acquisitions and div estiture-related items because the nature, size, timing and number of acquisitions and div estitures can v ary dramatically from period-to-period and between the Company and its peers and can also obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult.\n\nThroughout this discussion, references to sales growth or decline refer to the impact of both price and unit sales and references to productiv ity improvements generally refer to improv ed cost efficiencies resulting from the ongoing application of DBS.\n\nThe Company deems acquisition-related transaction costs incurred in a giv en period to be significant (generally relating to the Company's larger acquisitions) if it determines that such costs exceed the range of acquisition-related transaction costs typical for Danaher in a giv en period.\n\n## Sales Growth (Decline) and Core Sales Decline\n\n",

      "answer": "In fiscal year 2023, JNJ's Innovative Medicine segment reported litigation expenses of $0.6 billion primarily tied to Risperdal Gynecomastia, while in 2024, these expenses decreased to $0.3 billion for the same category. Despite this reduction, the segment's pre-tax income fell significantly from $479 million in 2023 to $102 million in 2024. This counterintuitive trend suggests that other factors, such as increased restructuring charges or impairment costs, may have offset the benefit of lower litigation expenses. Notably, in 2024, the segment also incurred an acquired in-process R&D expense of $1.25 billion related to the Yellow Jersey acquisition, which likely contributed to the decline in profitability.",

      "answer": "In 2021, DHR experienced an unfavorable impact of 45 basis points on operating profit margins due to incremental year-over-year material and labor costs. By 2023, the company saw a significant decline in operating profit margins by 660 basis points compared to 2022, primarily driven by lower core sales, product mix effects, and reduced leverage in operational and administrative cost structures. The connection between material and labor costs and operating profit margins evolved as the company faced compounded pressures from declining core sales, particularly in molecular diagnostics due to reduced demand for COVID-19 tests, which further weakened margin performance.

      "question": "How did the restructuring of JNJ's Orthopaedics franchise in 2023 impact the company's ability to leverage selling and marketing expenses, compared to the 2022 performance of the MedTech segment which had seen strong growth across franchises like Surgery and Vision?",
      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ's MedTech segment experienced strong growth across multiple franchises including Surgery ($9.8B in sales) and Vision ($4.7B in sales), which supported leveraging in selling and marketing expenses. However, in 2023, the restructuring of the Orthopaedics franchise within the MedTech segment resulted in a $0.3 billion pre-tax restructuring expense, which, along with commodity inflation and higher amortization from Abiomed, contributed to a decline in the MedTech segment income before tax as a percent of sales from 16.2% in 2022 to 15.4% in 2023. Despite this, the MedTech segment still achieved some leveraging in selling and marketing expenses, although not enough to fully offset the negative factors. This shows that while the company maintained some cost efficiency in marketing, the restructuring and external cost pressures constrained overall profitability improvements.",

      "answer": "In 2022, 87% of CVS's Medicare Advantage members were in plans with a star rating of at least 4.0, up from 83% in 2021. However, by 2024, the company's medical benefit ratio (MBR) had increased from 86.2% to 92.5%, with management explicitly attributing part of this rise to the unfavorable impact of Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year. This indicates that lower star ratings likely reduced bonus payments from CMS, which are tied to plan quality, and thereby increased the effective cost burden on the company. As a result, a higher percentage of premium revenues were spent on medical benefits, revealing a direct negative impact of lower star ratings on cost efficiency in insured health care products.",

Future operating results could be adversely affected if the premium rates requested are not approved or are adjusted downward or their approval is delayed by state or federal regulators.\n\nThe Company has Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts with CMS to provide HMO, PPO and prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in certain geographic areas. Under these annual contracts, CMS pays the Company a fixed per member (or 'capitation') payment and/or a portion of the premium, both of which are based on membership and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors. CMS also considers inflation, changes in utilization patterns and average per capita fee-for-service Medicare costs in the calculation of the fixed capitation payment or premium. PDP contracts also provide a risk-sharing arrangement with CMS to limit the Company's exposure to unfavorable expenses or benefit from favorable expenses. Amounts payable to the Company under the Medicare arrangements are subject to annual revision by CMS, and the Company elects to participate in each Medicare service area or region on an annual basis. Premiums paid to the Company for Medicare products are subject to federal government reviews and audits, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive and prospective premium adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members. In addition to payments received from CMS, some Medicare Advantage products and all PDP products require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer. In some cases these supplemental premiums are adjusted based on the member's income and asset levels. Compared to Commercial Medical products, Medicare contracts generate higher per member per month revenues and higher health care and other benefit costs.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the 'ACA') ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan's reimbursement to the plan's 'star ratings.' Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company's 2022 star ratings in October 2021. The Company's 2022 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company's Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2023. Based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2021, 87% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2022 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 83% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2021 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2020.\n\nRates for Medicare Supplement products are regulated at the state level and vary by state and plan.\n\nUnder Insured Medicaid contracts, state government agencies pay the Company fixed monthly rates per member that vary by state, line of business and demographics; and the Company arranges, pays for and manages the health care services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. These rates are subject to change by each state, and, in some instances, provide for adjustment for health risk factors. CMS requires these rates to be actuarially sound. The Company also receives fees from customers where it provides services under ASC Medicaid contracts. ASC Medicaid contracts generally are for periods of more than one year, and certain of them contain performance incentives and limited financial risk sharing with respect to certain medical, financial and operational metrics. Under these arrangements, performance is evaluated annually, with associated financial incentive opportunities, and financial risk share obligations are typically limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company. Payments to the Company under Medicaid contracts are subject to the annual appropriation process in the applicable state.\n\nUnder Duals contracts, the rate setting process is generally established by CMS in partnership with the state government agency participating in the demonstration project. Both CMS and the state government agency may seek premium and other refunds under certain circumstances, including if the Company fails to comply with CMS regulations or other contractual requirements.\n\nThe Company offers HMO and consumer-directed medical and dental plans to federal employees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits ('FEHB') Program and the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. Premium rates and fees for those plans are subject to federal government review and audit, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive and prospective premium and fee adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members.\n\nBeginning in 2014, the ACA imposed significant new industry-wide fees, assessments and taxes, including an annual levy known as the health insurer fee (the 'HIF'). The HIF applied for 2020 and was temporarily suspended for 2019. In December 2019, the HIF was repealed for calendar years after 2020. For additional information on the ACA fees, assessments and taxes, see Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K. The Company's goal is to collect premiums and fees where possible, or solve for, all of the ACA-related fees, assessments and taxes.",

Management uses MBR to assess the underlying business performance and underwriting of its insurance products, understand variances between actual results and expected results and identify trends in period-over-period results. MBR provides management and investors with information useful in assessing the operating results of the Company's Insured Health Care Benefits products.\n- The MBR increased from 86.2% to 92.5% in 2024 compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased utilization, the unfavorable impact of the Company's Medicare Advantage star ratings for the 2024 payment year and higher acuity in Medicaid following the resumption of redeterminations.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Health Care Benefits segment include selling, general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization expenses.\n- Operating expenses increased $1.8 billion, or 11.1%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by increased operating expenses to support the growth across the business. Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to 13.8% in the year ended December 31, 2024 compared to 15.3% in the prior year, reflecting improved fixed cost leverage across the business due to membership growth.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Corporate/Other segment recorded $507 million in pre-tax restructuring charges, including $344 million in severance and employee-related costs, which were reflected in management and administrative expenses. In 2024, these expenses continued to be disclosed as part of the Corporate/Other segment, indicating that the restructuring efforts in 2023 had a lasting impact on the company\u2019s administrative cost structure. This demonstrates a temporal evolution where prior-year restructuring decisions directly influenced the ongoing expense disclosures in the following year.",

As of December 31, 2024, the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment operated more than 9,000 retail locations, as well as online retail pharmacy websites, LTC pharmacies and on-site pharmacies, retail specialty pharmacy stores, compounding pharmacies and branches for infusion and enteral nutrition services.\n\n## Corporate/Other Segment\n\nThe Company presents the remainder of its financial results in the Corporate/Other segment, which primarily consists of:\n\n- Management and administrative expenses to support the Company's overall operations, which include certain aspects of executive management and the corporate relations, legal, compliance, human resources and finance departments, information technology, digital, data and analytics, as well as acquisitionrelated transaction and integration costs; and\n- Products for which the Company no longer solicits or accepts new customers such as its large case pensions and long-term care insurance products.\n\n## Basis of Presentation\n\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of CVS Health and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ('GAAP'). The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities ('V IEs') for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform with the current year presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n\n## Cash and Cash Equivalents\n\nCash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. The Company invests in short-term money market funds, commercial paper and time deposits, as well as other debt securities that are classified as cash equivalents within the accompanying consolidated balance sheets, as these funds are highly liquid and readily convertible to known amounts of cash.\n\n## Restricted Cash\n\nRestricted cash included in other current assets on the consolidated balance sheets primarily represents funds held on behalf of members and funds held in escrow in connection with agreements with accountable care organizations. Restricted cash included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheets represents amounts held in a trust in one of the Company's captive insurance companies to satisfy collateral requirements associated with the assignment of certain insurance policies. All restricted cash is invested in demand deposits, time deposits and money market funds.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents on the consolidated balance sheets to total cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash on the consolidated statements of cash flows as of December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, JNJ reported $1,198M in Property, Plant & Equipment (PP&E) investments for the Pharmaceutical segment, which included the Innovative Medicine business. By 2023, this figure increased to $1,653M for the newly branded Innovative Medicine segment, reflecting a 38% year-over-year growth in capital expenditures. This increase in PP&E investment aligns with the strategic development of the Innovative Medicine segment, which focuses on therapeutic areas such as Immunology and Oncology. The 2023 filing emphasizes JNJ's commitment to innovation across these therapeutic areas, with $15.1B invested in R&D. The significant rise in capital investment suggests a deliberate effort to expand production and R&D capabilities in support of the segment's strategic direction toward more advanced and innovative therapies.",

      "question": "How did the increase in global healthcare spending pressures observed in 2022 influence Pfizer's drug pricing strategies by 2024, particularly in response to managed care organizations' growing cost-containment efforts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Pfizer noted increasing healthcare spending pressures driven by an aging global population and greater demand for innovative medicines, which led to heightened scrutiny of drug pricing. By 2024, these pressures had translated into stronger cost-containment strategies by managed care organizations (MCOs), which now covered approximately 317 million people in the U.S. and were increasingly excluding high-cost drugs from formularies or placing them on higher tiers. This shift caused Pfizer to adapt its go-to-market model, emphasizing value demonstration and engaging directly with payors and the U.S. government to advocate for patient access and favorable reimbursement policies. The company also faced increased rebate demands and formulary restrictions, which negatively impacted drug prices and revenue growth.",

          "chunk_text": "products, our R&amp;D efforts seek to add value to our existing products by improving their effectiveness and ease of dosing and by discovering potential new indications. See the Item 1. Business -Research and Development section of this Form 10-K for our R&amp;D priorities and strategy. We seek to leverage a strong pipeline, organize around expected operational growth drivers and capitalize on trends creating long-term growth opportunities, including:\n\n- an aging global population that is generating increased demand for innovative medicines and vaccines that address patients' unmet needs;\n- advances in both biological science and digital technology that are enhancing the delivery of breakthrough new medicines and vaccines; and\n- the increasingly significant role of hospitals in healthcare systems.\n\n## Our Business Development Initiatives\n\nWe are committed to strategically capitalizing on growth opportunities, primarily by advancing our own product pipeline and maximizing the value of our existing products, but also through various business development activities. We view our business development activity as an enabler of our strategies and seek to generate growth by pursuing opportunities and transactions that have the potential to strengthen our business and our capabilities. We assess our business, assets and scientific capabilities/portfolio as part of our regular, ongoing portfolio review process and also continue to consider business development activities that will help advance our business strategy.\n\nOur significant recent business development activities that closed or are targeted to close in 2022 include:\n\n## Acquisition of Arena\n\nIn December 2021, we and Arena announced that the companies entered into a definitive agreement under which we will acquire Arena, a clinical stage company developing innovative potential therapies for the treatment of several immuno-inflammatory diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, we will acquire all outstanding shares of Arena for $100 per share in an all-cash transaction for a total equity value of approximately $6.7 billion. On February 2, 2022, Arena shareholders voted to approve the proposed acquisition, which is targeted to close in the first half of 2022, subject to review under antitrust laws and other customary closing conditions.\n\n## Collaboration with Biohaven\n\nIn November 2021, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement and related sublicense agreement with Biohaven Pharmaceutical Holding Company Ltd., Biohaven Pharmaceutical Ireland DAC and BioShin Limited (collectively, Biohaven) pursuant to which we acquired rights to commercialize rimegepant and zavegepant for the treatment and prevention of migraines outside of the U.S., subject to regulatory approval. Rimegepant is currently commercialized in the U.S., Israel, and the U.A.E. under the brand name Nurtec ODT, with certain additional applications pending outside of the U.S. Biohaven will continue to lead R&amp;D globally and we have the exclusive right to commercialization globally, outside of the U.S. Upon the closing of the transaction, which occurred on January 4, 2022, we paid Biohaven $500 million, including an upfront payment of $150 million and an equity investment of $350 million. Biohaven is also eligible to receive up to $740 million in non-U.S. commercialization milestone payments, in addition to tiered double-digit royalties on net sales outside of the U.S. In addition to the milestone payments and royalties above, we will also reimburse Biohaven for the portion of certain additional milestone payments and royalties due to third parties in accordance with preexisting Biohaven agreements, which are attributed to exU.S. sales. \u00ae\n\nFor additional information, including discussion of recent significant business development activities, see Note 2 .\n\n## Our 2021 Performance\n\n## Revenues\n\nRevenues increased $39.6 billion, or 95%, to $81.3 billion in 2021 from $41.7 billion in 2020, reflecting an operational increase of $38.4 billion, or 92%, as well as a favorable impact of foreign exchange of $1.2 billion, or 3%. Excluding direct sales and alliance revenues of Comirnaty and sales of Paxlovid, revenues increased 6% operationally, reflecting strong growth in Eliquis, Biosimilars, PC1, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, the Hospital therapeutic area, Inlyta and Xtandi, partially offset by declines in the Prevnar family, Chantix/Champix, Enbrel and Sutent.\n\nThe following outlines the components of the net change in revenues:\n\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income--Revenues by Geography and Revenues--Selected Product Discussion sections within MD&amp;A for more information, including a discussion of key drivers of our revenue performance.

          "chunk_text": "Economic slowdowns could lead to decreased utilization of our products, affecting our sales. Declining tax rev enues and increased gov ernment spending on other programs attributable to unev en economic growth or downturns increase the pressure on gov ernments to reduce healthcare spending, leading to increased control of drug prices or lower utilization. Additionally, some customers, including gov ernments or other entities reliant upon gov ernment funding and cash-pay patients, may be unable to pay for our products fully or in a timely manner. Also, if our customers, suppliers, or collaboration partners experience financial difficulties, we could experience slower customer collections, greater bad debt expense, and performance defaults by suppliers or collaboration partners. Similarly, unev en economic growth or downturns could limit our ability to access capital markets.\n\nIn addition, significant portions of our business are conducted in Europe, Asia, and other international geographies. Trade and other global disputes and interruptions, including related to tariffs, trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements, the imposition of trade sanctions or similar restrictions by the U.S. or other gov ernments, international tension and conflicts, as well as economic stagnation, cost inflation, strains on global transportation, manufacturing, and labor markets, and public health outbreaks, epidemics, or pandemics affect our ability to do business. Among other risks, the use of tariffs and other trade restrictions increase costs and may impact clinical trials or sales of our products, or otherwise complicate aspects of our business. In particular, tensions between the U.S. and China, which hav e already led to a series of tariffs and sanctions, as well as other business restrictions, could further escalate based on additional trade restrictions or retaliation thereto. In February 2025, the U.S. presidential administration imposed new tariffs on Chinese goods and China responded with tariffs on select U.S. goods. Additionally, tariffs were proposed or threatened with respect to other jurisdictions, including Mexico, Canada and Europe. If geopolitical tensions were to increase and disrupt our operations in, or related to, China or other major international geographies, such disruption would significantly impact our business. See Item 1A, \"Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Operations-Reliance on third-party relationships and outsourcing arrangements could adv ersely affect our business,\" for additional information. As a further example, the financial impact of higher energy prices, defense spending, and geopolitical and economic disruptions, has further exacerbated financial pressures on gov ernments with single-payer or gov ernment funded healthcare systems, leading to increased impetus for increases in rebates, clawbacks, and other reforms to reimbursement systems, particularly in Europe. These and similar ev ents hav e adv ersely affected, and may continue to adv ersely affect, us, our business partners, and our customers. For more details, see Item 1, \"Business-Regulations and Priv ate Payer Actions Affecting Pharmaceutical Pricing, Reimbursement, and Access.\"\n\nIn addition to dev elopments related to our business or financial results, or those of our competitors, unev en economic growth, downturns, or other negativ e global dev elopments, could also undermine our growth or result in significant and sudden declines in the trading price of our common stock and market capitalization.\n\n## \u00b7 Changes in foreign currency rates, interest rate risks, and inflation or deflation affect our results of operations.\n\nAs a global company, we face foreign currency risk exposure from fluctuating currency exchange rates, interest rate risk from our exposure to floating and v ariable interest rates, and existing and expected rates of inflation or deflation in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, each of which impacts our results of operations. In recent periods, significant fluctuations in currency rates and inflation hav e impacted our results of operations. We are a net receiv er of foreign currencies, and our results of operations are adv ersely impacted when the U.S. dollar is strong compared to foreign currencies. Further, in the ev ent of an extreme dev aluation of local currency in a particular market in which we operate, the price of our products could become unsustainable in the relev ant market. Inflationary pressures in recent periods hav e also negativ ely impacted us and may continue to negativ ely impact us in v arious ways, including cost inflation, higher labor costs, and other higher expenses, with some of these higher expenses due in part to policy actions intended to curb inflation. See Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Financial Condition and Liquidity\" and Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Implementation of New Financial Accounting Standards,\" for more details.",

P rivate third-party payors, such as health plans, increasingly challenge pharm aceutical product pricing, which could result in lower prices, lower reim bursem ent rates for payors and a reduction in dem and for our products, including denial of coverage of our products, if lower cost alternatives are available. P ayors often require significant discounts, or rebates, from  our prices in exchange for m ore favorable form ulary placem ent. P ricing pressures also m ay occur as a result of highly com petitive biopharm aceutical m arkets and increasing concentration of insurers and P BM s. H ealthcare provider purchasers, directly or through group purchasing organizations, are seeking enhanced discounts or im plem enting m ore rigorous bidding or purchasing review processes.\n\nWe believe m edicines and vaccines are the m ost efficient and effective use of healthcare dollars based on the value they deliver to the overall healthcare system . W e work with law makers and advocate for solutions that effectively im prove patient health outcom es, lower costs to the healthcare system , and help ensure access to m edicines and vaccines within an efficient and affordable healthcare system . T his includes assessing our go-to m arket m odel to help address patient affordability challenges. W e have engaged with m ajor payors and the U .S. governm ent to explore opportunities to im prove access and reim bursem ent in an effort to drive pro-patient policies. In addition, in response to the evolving U .S. and global healthcare spending landscape, we work with health authorities, health technology assessm ent and quality m easurem ent bodies and m ajor U .S. payors throughout the productdevelopm ent process to better understand how these entities value our com pounds and products. Further, we are developing stronger support designed to dem onstrate the value of the m edicines and vaccines that we discover or develop, register and m anufacture.\n\nFor inform ation on governm ent pricing pressures, see the Item 1. Business -Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors -Pricing and Reimbursement sections.\n\nManaged Care Organizations. The evolution of m anaged care in the U .S. has been a m ajor factor in the com petitiveness of the healthcare m arketplace. Approxim ately 317 m illion people in the U .S. now have som e form  of health insurance coverage, and the m arketing of prescription drugs and vaccines to both consum ers and the entities that m anage coverage in the U .S. continues to grow in im portance. In particular, the influence of M C O s has increased in recent years due to the growing num ber of patients receiving coverage through MCOs. At the sam e tim e, consolidation in the M C O  industry has resulted in fewer, even larger M C O s, which enhances those M C O s' ability to negotiate lower pricing and further increases their im portance to our business. Since M C O s purport to seek to contain and reduce healthcare expenditures, their growing influence has increased downward pressure on drug prices, as well as negatively im pacted revenues.\n\nMCOs and their P BM s typically negotiate prices with pharm aceutical providers by using form ularies (which are lists of approved m edicines available to M C O  m em bers), clinical protocols (which require prior authorization for a branded product if a generic product is available or require the patient to first fail on one or m ore generic products before perm itting access to a branded m edicine), long-term  contracts and their ability to influence volum e and m arket share of prescription drugs. In addition, by placing branded m edicines on highertier or non-preferred status in their form ularies, M C O s transfer to the patient higher patient out-of-pocket expenses. T his financial disincentive is a tool for M C O s to m anage drug costs and channel patients to m edicines preferred by the M C O s. W e expect paym ent reform s for M C O s will continue to evolve with increased em phasis on expanded participation and on rem oving barriers to equitable healthcare.\n\nThe breadth of the products covered by form ularies can vary considerably from  one M C O  to another, and m any form ularies include alternative and com petitive products for treatm ent of particular m edical problem s. M C O s em phasize prim ary and preventive care, out-patient treatm ent and procedures perform ed at doctors' offices and clinics as ways to m anage costs. H ospitalization and surgery, typically the m ost expensive form s of treatm ent, are carefully m anaged, and drugs that can help in chronic care m anagem ent and reduce the need for hospitalization, professional therapy or surgery m ay becom e favored first-line treatm ents for certain diseases. At the sam e tim e, M C O s m ay seek to exclude high-cost drugs from form ularies in their efforts to m anage and lower their costs.\n\nExclusion of a product from  a form ulary or other restrictions can significantly im pact drug usage in the M C O  or P BM  m anaged patient population and beyond. C onsequently, pharm aceutical com panies com pete to gain access to form ularies for their products, typically on the basis of unique product features, such as greater efficacy, better patient ease of use, or fewer side effects, as well as the overall cost of the therapy. W e continue to seek to ensure that our m ajor products are included on M C O  form ularies. H owever, our branded products are increasingly being placed on the higher tiers or in a non-preferred status. C ontinuing efforts by m anaged care entities to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or im pose price controls m ay adversely affect dem and for our products and our financial perform ance. See the Item 1A. Risk Factors -Managed Care Trends section.\n\n## RAW MATERIALS\n\nWe procure raw m aterials essential to our business from  num erous suppliers worldwide. In general, these m aterials have been available in sufficient quantities to support our dem and and in m any cases are available from  m ultiple suppliers. W e do not anticipate the availability of raw m aterials to have a significant im pact on our operations in 2025, but are m onitoring potential supply chain disruptions as a result of ongoing geopolitical and trade negotiations, which could, am ong other things, im pact costs. W e are continuing to m onitor and im plem ent mitigation strategies to reduce any potential risk or im pact including active supplier m anagem ent, qualification of additional suppliers and advanced purchasing to the extent possible.\n\n## GOVERNMENT REGULATION AND PRICE CONSTRAINTS\n\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by governm ent authorities in the countries in which we do business. T his includes laws and regulations governing the operations of biopharm aceutical com panies, such as the approval, m anufacturing and m arketing of products, pricing (including discounts and rebates) and price reporting, interactions with healthcare professionals, institutions, and referral sources, reporting of rem uneration provided to healthcare providers and academ ic m edical centers, financial assistance provided to patients, clinical research, data privacy and inform ation security, am ong others. T hese laws and regulations m ay require adm inistrative guidance for im plem entation, and a failure to comply could subject us to legal and/or adm inistrative actions. E nforcem ent m easures m ay include substantial fines and/or penalties, orders to stop non-com pliant activities, crim inal charges, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, delays in product approvals, exclusion from  participation in governm ent program s or contracts as well as lim itations on conducting business in applicable jurisdictions, and could result in harm  to our reputation and business.

      "answer": "In 2023, CVS incurred $487M in acquisition-related transaction and integration costs, which were fully allocated to the Corporate & Other segment and contributed to its $2,397M operating loss. This reflects a significant negative impact on the segment\u2019s performance. In 2024, the Corporate & Other segment continued to play a critical role in managing legal and regulatory risks, including exposure to qui tam lawsuits and other legal proceedings, indicating a shift in the segment\u2019s focus from integration costs to litigation-related liabilities. This evolution suggests that while the segment absorbed major one-time acquisition costs in 2023, it transitioned in 2024 to a center for managing ongoing legal and regulatory exposure.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company's segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for 24%, 19% and 18%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company's segments to the consolidated totals:",

      "question": "How did the decline in DHR's operating profit margins in 2023, driven by inventory charges and product mix issues, influence the company's fair value adjustments to inventory in 2024 following the Abcam acquisition?",
      "answer": "In 2023, DHR's operating profit margins declined by 660 basis points, with 40 basis points of that decline directly attributed to 'acquisition-related transaction costs, settlement of pre-acquisition share-based payment awards and fair value adjustments to inventory' related to the Abcam acquisition. This indicates that inventory adjustments had a measurable negative impact on profitability in 2023. By 2024, the company noted a favorable 100 basis point impact in operating profit margin comparisons due to the net effect of fair value adjustments to inventory between 2023 (Abcam-related) and 2024, suggesting that inventory management improved or normalized post-acquisition. The evolution from a negative 40 basis point impact in 2023 to a positive 100 basis point adjustment in 2024 shows that DHR mitigated some of the earlier inventory-related margin pressures, likely through integration efficiencies or cost adjustments following the Abcam acquisition.",

      "question": "How did the integration of pharmaceutical supply chain operations in 2022 influence the expansion of CVS's Health Services segment in 2023, particularly in relation to their newly acquired provider enablement capabilities and biosimilar development initiatives?",
      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's Pharmaceuticals segment played a foundational role in the company's supply chain and formulary management, which directly supported its pharmacy benefit management (PBM) services. By 2023, this relationship evolved as the company restructured its operations, integrating pharmaceutical services more deeply into the Health Services segment. This integration was amplified by the acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health, which expanded provider enablement and value-based care delivery. Additionally, the launch of Cordavis, a biosimilar development subsidiary, signaled a strategic shift to leverage its pharmaceutical supply chain expertise toward cost-effective drug development. These moves demonstrate how CVS transformed its pharmaceutical dependency into a broader health services strategy, enhancing both clinical service delivery and cost management capabilities.",

        "Hop 1: CVS(2022) \u2192 Pharmaceuticals: The company's 2022 operations relied heavily on its Pharmaceuticals segment for PBM and supply chain services.",

        "Hop 3: Health Services Segment \u2190 CVS(2023): In 2023, CVS expanded the Health Services segment through strategic acquisitions and launched Cordavis, transforming how pharmaceutical services were integrated into broader health care delivery."

      "answer": "In 2022, Johnson & Johnson reported a Prior Service Credit of $5 million (JNJ_10k_2022.pdf), indicating a reduction in future benefit obligations from plan amendments. By 2024, the company disclosed a Post-Employment Benefits liability of $2,910 million (JNJ_10k_2024.pdf), up from $2,527 million in 2023. The 2024 data also shows a Prior Service Cost (Credit) of -$21 million for Post-Employment Benefits (PM_10k_2024.pdf), meaning a new obligation was added. This indicates that despite a small credit in 2022, the company's post-employment benefit liabilities have increased significantly by 2024, suggesting growing long-term obligations to former employees, which could pressure future cash flows and earnings.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "answer": "In 2023, a 2% increase in market interest rates led to an increase in UNH's interest expense per annum by $393 million, while in 2024, the same 2% increase resulted in a higher interest expense of $537 million. This indicates that UNH's interest expense became more sensitive to market interest rate increases in 2024 compared to 2023, potentially due to a larger debt base or changes in the composition of its liabilities. The $144 million difference in sensitivity highlights an increased financial exposure to interest rate movements year-over-year.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's earnings from operations increased from $28.435 billion in 2022 to $32.287 billion in 2024, representing a $3.852 billion growth. In 2022, Optum contributed $11.995 billion of the earnings from operations, which was 42.2% of the total. While the 2024 data does not explicitly disclose Optum's standalone earnings, its earlier 14% revenue growth and consistent contribution pattern suggest that Optum likely continued to play a significant role in driving the overall increase in earnings from operations by 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UnitedHealth reported $4.46 billion in Medicare Supplement (Standardized) revenue, reflecting the size of the business at that time. By 2024, UnitedHealthcare Medicare & Retirement served 4.3 million seniors through various Medicare Supplement products, indicating a continued strong presence in this market segment. During this period, UnitedHealth expanded its home-based care offerings, with the HouseCalls program conducting 2.9 million clinical preventive home visits in 2024. This suggests a strategic evolution where the company maintained its Medicare Supplement revenue base while investing in enhanced care delivery models aimed at improving senior health outcomes and potentially reducing long-term costs. The growth in home care services likely supports customer retention and satisfaction within the Medicare Supplement segment.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Johnson & Johnson reported $25.081 billion in identifiable assets linked to the Consumer Health segment, which had generated $1.294 billion in pre-tax income that year. This segment remained part of JNJ\u2019s consolidated operations through most of 2023. However, on August 23, 2023, JNJ ceased consolidating the Consumer Health business following an exchange offer, indicating a strategic divestiture. The reduction in identifiable assets from 2021 to 2023, alongside the eventual divestiture, suggests a deliberate realignment of JNJ\u2019s portfolio, moving away from lower-growth consumer assets toward higher-margin pharmaceutical and medical device businesses.",

      "answer": "JNJ increased its capital expenditures for Innovative Medicine from $1,198M in 2021 to $1,374M in 2022 and further to $1,653M in 2023, signaling a strategic focus on strengthening this segment. Following the Consumer Health business separation in Q3 2023, JNJ reorganized into two reportable segments\u2014Innovative Medicine and MedTech\u2014where the CEO began allocating resources predominantly through annual forecasting, using segment income before tax as a key metric. This structural change in 2024 demonstrates that the earlier capital investments in Innovative Medicine were part of a broader strategic realignment to focus on core therapeutic innovation, with resource allocation now formally optimized around this bifurcated business model.",

      "question": "How did Merck's 2022 IPR&D valuation assumptions around product development milestones influence the 15% growth in Pharmaceutical segment profits reported in 2024, particularly in light of the shared development costs and profit-sharing structure of the V940 (mRNA-4157) collaboration with Moderna?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Merck used an income approach to value IPR&D assets, incorporating assumptions about the probability-adjusted future net cash flows of products in development, including those dependent on successful completion of clinical milestones. These assumptions directly influenced the contingent consideration liabilities and long-term amortization schedules tied to acquired assets. By 2024, the Pharmaceutical segment reported a 15% profit increase, partly driven by successful development and commercialization of key products. The V940 collaboration with Moderna, initiated in 2022 with a $250 million payment and ongoing shared R&D costs (capitalized at $198 million by 2024), exemplifies how early IPR&D valuations and milestone-based funding translated into tangible profit contributions through joint development and equal profit-sharing. This demonstrates a clear temporal chain where 2022 valuation assumptions underpinned 2024 financial performance in the Pharmaceutical segment.",

Transaction costs and costs to restructure the acquired company are expensed as incurred. The operating results  of  the  acquired  business  are  reflected  in  the  Company's  consolidated financial statements after the date of the acquisition.\n\nThe  judgments  made  in  determining  estimated  fair  values  assigned  to  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in  a business combination, as well as asset lives, can materially affect the Company's results of operations.\n\nThe fair values of identifiable intangible assets related to currently marketed products and product rights are primarily determined by using an income approach through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's discounted projected net cash flows.  The  Company's  estimates  of  market  participant  net  cash  flows  consider  historical  and  projected  pricing,  margins  and expense levels; the performance of competing products where applicable; relevant industry and therapeutic area growth drivers and factors; current and expected trends in technology and product life cycles; the time and investment that will be required to develop products and technologies; the ability to obtain marketing and regulatory approvals; the ability to manufacture and commercialize the  products;  the  extent  and  timing  of  potential  new  product  introductions  by  the  Company's  competitors;  and  the  life  of  each asset's  underlying  patent  and  any  related  patent  term  extension,  if  any.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then  probability-adjusted  where appropriate to consider the uncertainties associated with the underlying assumptions, as well as the risk profile of the net cash flows utilized  in  the  valuation.  The  probability-adjusted  future  net  cash  flows  of  each  product  are  then  discounted  to  present  value utilizing an appropriate discount rate.\n\nThe  fair  values  of  identifiable  intangible  assets  related  to  IPR&amp;D  are  also  determined  using  an  income  approach, through which fair value is estimated based on each asset's probability-adjusted future net cash flows, which reflect the different stages  of  development  of  each  product  and  the  associated  probability  of  successful  completion.  The  net  cash  flows  are  then discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Amounts allocated to acquired IPR&amp;D are capitalized and accounted for  as  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  subject  to  impairment  testing  until  completion  or  abandonment  of  the  projects.  Upon successful completion of each IPR&amp;D project, Merck will make a determination as to the then-useful life of the intangible asset, generally determined by the period in which the substantial majority of the cash flows are expected to be generated, and begin amortization.\n\nCertain  of  the  Company's  business  combinations  involve  the  potential  for  future  payment  of  consideration  that  is contingent upon the achievement of performance milestones, including product development milestones and royalty payments on future product sales. The fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs. These inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows, the probability of success (achievement of the contingent event) and the risk-adjusted discount rate used to present value the probability-weighted cash flows. Subsequent to the acquisition date, at each reporting period until the contingency is resolved, the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes (either expense or income) recorded in earnings. Changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment.\n\nIf the Company determines the transaction will not be accounted for as an acquisition of a business, the transaction will be accounted for as an asset acquisition rather than a business combination and, therefore, no goodwill will be recorded. In an asset acquisition, acquired IPR&amp;D with no alternative future use is charged to expense and contingent consideration is not recognized at the  acquisition  date.  In  these  instances,  product  development  milestones  are  recognized  upon  achievement  and  sales-based milestones are recognized when the milestone is deemed probable by the Company of being achieved.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nRecognition  of  revenue  requires  evidence  of  a  contract,  probable  collection  of  sales  proceeds  and  completion  of substantially all performance obligations. Merck acts as the principal in substantially all of its customer arrangements and therefore records  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The  majority  of  the  Company's  contracts  related  to  the  Pharmaceutical  and  Animal  Health segments have a single performance obligation - the promise to transfer goods. Shipping is considered immaterial in the context of the overall customer arrangement and damages or loss of goods in transit are rare. Therefore, shipping is not deemed a separately recognized performance obligation.\n\nThe vast majority of revenues from sales of products are recognized at a point in time when control of the goods is transferred to the customer, which the Company has determined is when title and risks and rewards of",

Pharmaceutical segment profits increased 11% in 2020 driven primarily by higher sales, as well as lower selling and promotional costs. Animal Health segment profits grew 17% in 2021 reflecting  higher  sales,  partially  offset  by  higher  promotional,  selling  and  administrative  costs. Animal  Health  segment  profits increased 4% in 2020 driven primarily by higher sales and lower promotional and selling costs, partially offset by higher R&amp;D costs and the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rates from continuing operations were 11.0% in 2021, 22.9% in 2020 and 21.8% in 2019. The full  year  effective  income  tax  rate  reflects  a  favorable  mix  of  income  and  expense,  as  well  as  higher  foreign  tax  credits  from ordinary business operations that the Company was able to credit in 2021. The effective income tax rate from continuing operations in 2021 also reflects the beneficial impact of the settlement of a foreign tax matter, as well as a net tax benefit of $207 million related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements). The effective income tax rate from continuing operations in 2021 also reflects the unfavorable effect of a charge for the acquisition of Pandion for which no tax benefit was recognized. The effective income tax rate in 2020 reflects the unfavorable impact of a charge for the acquisition of VelosBio for which no tax benefit was recognized. The effective income tax rate in 2019 reflects the favorable impact of a $106 million net tax benefit related to the settlement of certain federal income tax matters (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements) and the reversal of tax reserves established in connection with the 2014 divestiture of Merck's Consumer Care (MCC)  business  due  to  the  lapse  in  the  statute  of  limitations.  In  addition,  the  effective  income  tax  rate  in  2019  reflects  the unfavorable impact of a charge for the acquisition of Peloton for which no tax benefit was recognized and charges of $117 million related to the finalization of treasury regulations for the transition tax associated with the 2017 enactment of U.S. tax legislation known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\n\nNet income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests was $13 million in 2021, $4 million in 2020 and $(84) million in 2019. The loss in 2019 was driven primarily by the portion of goodwill impairment charges related to certain businesses in the Healthcare Services segment that were attributable to noncontrolling interests.\n\n## Non-GAAP Income and Non-GAAP EPS from Continuing Operations\n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are alternative views of the Company's performance that Merck is providing because management believes this information enhances investors' understanding of the Company's results as it permits investors to understand how management assesses performance. Non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS exclude certain items because of the  nature  of  these  items  and  the  impact  that  they  have  on  the  analysis  of  underlying  business  performance  and  trends.  The excluded items (which should not be considered non-recurring) consist of acquisition and divestiture-related costs, restructuring costs,  income  and  losses  from  investments  in  equity  securities  and  certain  other  items.  These  excluded  items  are  significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance.\n\nNon-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are important internal measures for the Company. Senior management receives a monthly analysis of operating results that includes non-GAAP EPS. Management uses these measures internally for planning and forecasting purposes and to measure the performance of the Company along with other metrics. In addition, senior management's annual compensation is derived in part using non-GAAP pretax income. Since non-GAAP income and non-GAAP EPS are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, they have no standardized meaning prescribed by GAAP and, therefore, may not be  comparable  to  the  calculation  of  similar  measures  of  other  companies.  The  information  on  non-GAAP  income  and  nonGAAP  EPS  should  be  considered  in  addition  to,  but  not  as  a  substitute  for  or  superior  to,  net  income  and  EPS  prepared  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (GAAP).",

      "answer": "In 2023, Optum's earnings from operations were $15,943 million, and by 2024, this increased to $16,703 million, showing growth in Optum's segment performance. This growth was attributed to improvements at Optum Health and Optum Rx, despite a decrease in earnings from Optum Insight. Meanwhile, UnitedHealthcare experienced a decline in earnings from operations due to factors such as Medicare Advantage funding reductions, Medicaid redeterminations, and the impacts of the Change Healthcare cyberattack. However, Optum's growth helped offset some of these challenges through gains related to business portfolio refinement, strategic transactions, and increased investment income. The interconnectedness of Optum's improved performance with the broader UNH operations highlights how segment-level improvements contributed to mitigating pressures in other parts of the business.",

      "answer": "In 2023, a 2% increase in market interest rates led to a $3,642 million decrease in the fair value of UNH's financial assets, while in 2024, the same 2% increase caused a larger $4,151 million decrease. This indicates that UNH's financial assets became more sensitive to interest rate fluctuations year-over-year. The increased sensitivity suggests a higher valuation risk exposure in 2024 compared to 2023, as the fair value of assets declined more sharply under the same interest rate stress test scenario.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CVS integrated Signify Health and Oak Street Health into the Health Services segment, which was expected to enhance care delivery capabilities and drive value through expanded services. However, despite these strategic acquisitions, the adjusted operating income in 2024 decreased by $189 million, or 3.2%, compared to 2023. This decline was primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and reduced front store volume, including lower contributions from post-pandemic OTC test kits. While the Health Services segment had previously contributed $6,492 million to adjusted operating income in 2023, the 2024 results suggest that the integration did not yet yield sufficient operational improvements to offset broader segment headwinds, indicating a lag in expected synergies or increased short-term costs associated with integration.",

These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's Corporate/Other segment incurred $332 million in acquisition-related integration costs, indicating initial investment and integration activities tied to acquisitions. By 2024, the Corporate/Other segment was still incurring acquisition-related integration costs, but now specifically tied to the more strategic acquisitions of Signify Health and Oak Street Health. This reflects a shift in the segment\u2019s focus from general integration activities to supporting larger, transformational acquisitions aimed at expanding CVS\u2019s health care delivery footprint. The continued allocation of integration costs to the Corporate/Other segment suggests that these activities remain central to corporate-level strategic initiatives rather than being absorbed into operating segments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n\n## 1. Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nCVS Health Corporation, together with its subsidiaries (collectively, 'CVS Health' or the 'Company'), has more than 9,900 retail locations, nearly 1,200 walk-in medical clinics, a leading pharmacy benefits manager with approximately 110 million plan members with expanding specialty pharmacy solutions and a dedicated senior pharmacy care business serving more than one million patients per year.

The Company believes its innovative health care model increases access to quality care, delivers better health outcomes and lowers overall health care costs.\n\nThe coronavirus disease 2019 ('COVID-19') and its emerging new variants continue to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The impact of COVID-19 on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and financial condition in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, as well as information regarding certain expected impacts of COVID-19 on the Company, is discussed throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Pharmacy Services, Retail/LTC and Corporate/Other, which are described below.\n\n## Health Care Benefits Segment\n\nThe Health Care Benefits segment operates as one of the nation's leading diversified health care benefits providers.

The Company refers to insurance products (where it assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'Insured' and administrative services contract products (where the plan sponsor assumes all or a majority of the risk for medical and dental care costs) as 'ASC.' In addition, effective January 2022, the Company entered the individual public health insurance exchanges ('Public Exchanges') in eight states through which it sells Insured plans directly to individual consumers.\n\n## Pharmacy Services Segment\n\nThe Pharmacy Services segment provides a full range of pharmacy benefit management ('PBM') solutions, including plan design offerings and administration, formulary management, retail pharmacy network management services and mail order pharmacy.

      "question": "How did the growth in CVS's Health Services segment from 2023 to 2024 affect the company's office real estate optimization charges given its corporate restructuring efforts?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Health Services segment grew significantly, with its balance increasing from $23,615 million at the end of 2022 to $34,066 million at the end of 2023. This expansion likely contributed to increased office space requirements. However, in 2024, despite continued growth in this segment, CVS initiated a corporate restructuring plan that included the closure of 271 retail stores in 2025 and a strategic review of its retail and office space usage. This led to office real estate optimization charges in 2024, which were primarily related to the abandonment of leased corporate office space in response to flexible work arrangements. While the 2023 charges were relatively small ($5 million attributed to Health Services), the 2024 charges reflect a broader strategic pivot, where growth in the Health Services segment was offset by deliberate reductions in physical footprint, resulting in increased charges tied to underutilized office assets.",

        "Hop 1: CVS(2023) \u2192 Health Services: The Health Services segment balance increased from $23,615 million in 2022 to $34,066 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Health Services \u2192 Office Real Estate Optimization Charges: The expansion of Health Services likely increased demand for office space, but this was later counteracted by a corporate decision to reduce real estate commitments.",

During the same period, the Segment Income for Analytical Instruments rose from $1,507M in 2022 to $1,908M in 2023, an increase of $401M or about 26.6%. This indicates that the unit not only grew in top-line revenue but also improved its profitability margin, as the income growth outpaced revenue growth.

      "question": "How did the restructuring activities in JNJ's MedTech segment in 2023 influence the level and composition of acquisition and integration costs reported in 2024, particularly in relation to the Shockwave and Abiomed acquisitions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ initiated a restructuring program in its MedTech segment, incurring $319 million in pre-tax restructuring expenses primarily related to inventory and instrument charges from exiting certain markets and product lines. This restructuring laid the groundwork for strategic acquisitions in 2024, including Shockwave and V-Wave. By 2024, the MedTech segment reported $1.0 billion in acquisition and integration costs, a significant increase from $0.2 billion in 2023 (primarily related to Abiomed). The Shockwave acquisition alone contributed $1.0 billion in integration costs and $0.2 billion in additional amortization. The restructuring in 2023, which was expected to be completed by 2025, enabled JNJ to pursue and integrate these acquisitions in 2024, directly influencing the composition and magnitude of the acquisition-related expenses in the later year.",

This resulted in the exit of certain programs within therapeutic areas. The R&amp;D program exits are primarily in infectious diseases and vaccines including the discontinuation of its respiratory syncytial virus (RSV ) adult vaccine program, hepatitis and HIV  development. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.1 billion in the fiscal year 2024 was recorded in Restructuring on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered development program costs, asset impairments and asset divestments. The pre-tax restructuring charge of approximately $0.5 billion in the fiscal year 2023, of which $449 million was recorded in Restructuring and $30 million was recorded in Cost of products sold on the Consolidated Statement of Earnings, and included the termination of partnered and non-partnered program costs and asset impairments. Total project costs of approximately $0.6 billion have been recorded since the restructuring was announced. The program was completed in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2024.\n\n32",

      "question": "How did the change in MDT's Discount Rate for Interest Cost from 2022 (ranging from 2.08% to 2.87%) to 2023 (reported at 3.03%) influence the disclosed Interest Cost Discount Rate in 2023, and what does this shift indicate about MDT's pension liability assumptions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MDT reported a range of 2.08% to 2.87% for the Discount Rate - Interest Cost for U.S. Pension Benefits. In 2023, this rate increased to 3.03%. This increase in the Discount Rate - Interest Cost directly contributed to a higher Interest Cost Discount Rate disclosed in 2023, which rose to 3.90%-4.23% from 2.08%-2.87% in the prior year. The upward shift indicates that MDT adjusted its assumptions regarding future pension liabilities, likely reflecting more optimistic expectations about returns or changes in market interest rates, which reduce the present value of future obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MDT(2022) \u2192 Discount Rate Interest Cost: MDT disclosed a range of 2.08% to 2.87% for the Discount Rate - Interest Cost in 2022.",
        "Hop 2: Discount Rate Interest Cost \u2192 Interest Cost Discount Rate: The Discount Rate - Interest Cost assumption directly influences the Interest Cost Discount Rate, as both are used in pension liability calculations.",
        "Hop 3: Interest Cost Discount Rate \u2190 MDT(2023): In 2023, MDT disclosed a higher range of 3.90% to 4.23% for the Discount Rate - Interest Cost, showing a clear increase from the previous year."

      "answer": "In 2023, Amgen's sales deductions rose to 53% from 51% in 2022, driven by higher U.S. chargeback and rebate discount rates, which negatively impacted ENBREL sales by reducing net selling price and increasing unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. In 2024, ENBREL sales continued to decline, now primarily driven by further reductions in net selling price, indicating that while sales deductions remained a factor, the downward pricing trend became more dominant. This evolution shows a shift from deductions-driven pressure in 2023 to a more sustained pricing erosion in 2024.",

This contrasts with 2023, where restructuring charges were primarily tied to severance and employee-related costs, with less severe asset impairments.

      "answer": "In 2023, Amgen faced payer-driven pricing pressures on Repatha, which led to a lower net selling price that partially offset volume growth. In response, Amgen reduced Repatha's list price and introduced new National Drug Codes to improve patient affordability and access. By 2024, this strategy intensified, with a 10% decrease in net selling price being more than offset by a significant 43% volume growth. Despite ongoing payer restrictions, such as utilization criteria and formulary exclusions, the shift toward greater volume adoption helped drive overall sales growth. However, affordability challenges persisted, particularly for Medicare patients, indicating that while the strategy improved access, it did not fully resolve payer-related sales headwinds.",

          "chunk_text": "expected to continue to have, a negative impact on the Company's product sales, business and results of operations. Louisiana, Arkansas, West V irginia, Minnesota, Kansas, Mississippi, Missouri and Maryland have enacted laws with mandates on manufacturers participating in the 340B Program, and, in 2024, no fewer than 25 states considered similar legislation. These bills vary, but typically include provisions on restricting a manufacturer's ability to direct drugs in 340B channels, recognizing 340B contract  pharmacies and a prohibition on requiring the inclusion of 340B claims modifiers.  In  March 2024, the  U.S.  Court of Appeals for the 8th  Circuit ruled that Arkansas' Act 1103, which prohibits drugmakers from restricting the acquisition or delivery of 340B drugs to covered entities and their contract pharmacies, was not preempted by the federal 340B statute. The decision contributed to an increase in the number of states considering similar legislation. In July 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi denied motions for a preliminary injunction in two cases challenging a similar law in Mississippi, finding that neither plaintiff had demonstrated a substantial likelihood of success on the merits. These orders are being appealed at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit. In September 2024, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana dismissed a lawsuit challenging Louisiana's 340B contract pharmacy mandate law, and the U.S. District Court for the  District of  Maryland denied a motion for preliminary injunction challenging a similar law in Maryland. These lawsuits challenging states on their 340B contract pharmacy laws are subsequent to Genesis Health Care, Inc. v. Becerra, where the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina issued an order in November 2023 that enjoins the Health Resources and Services Administration from enforcing its more restrictive interpretation of who is considered a patient under the 340B Program, to the potential benefit of healthcare systems seeking to expand the application of 340B discounts.\n\nAdditionally, on January 5, 2024, the FDA authorized Florida to move forward with its importation program proposal, though the state has not completed any significant steps towards importation within the one-year authorization window. Colorado, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Texas and V ermont have also enacted state importation laws, and some have submitted plans for approval to the FDA. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs.\n\nUltimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations.\n\n## -U.S. commercial payer actions have affected, and may continue to affect, access to and sales of our products\n\nPayers, including healthcare insurers,  PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from consolidations of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, are continuing to seek ways to further reduce their costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient co-pay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients' use of manufacturer commercial co-pay assistance programs. Further, government regulation of payers may affect these trends. Payers, including PBMs, have sought, and continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, and to also impose restrictions on access to, or usage of, our products (such as Step Therapy), require that patients receive the payer's prior authorization before covering the product, and/or chosen to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha has been prescribed meet their utilization criteria, and these requirements have served to limit patient access to Repatha treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers (including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans), and in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha prescriptions rather than paying their co-pay, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha available at a lower list  price.  However,  affordability  of  patient  out-of-pocket  co-pay  cost  has  limited,  and  may  continue  to  limit,  patient  use.  Further,  despite  these  net  and  list  price reductions, some payers have restricted, and may continue to restrict, patient access and may seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions, such as changing formulary coverage for Repatha, that could reduce its sales. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, negatively affecting Repatha sales.\n\nFurther, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in  the  United  States,  the  FTC's  interim  report  released  in  2024  showed  that  the  top  six   integrated  health  plans  and  PBMs  controlled  about  94%  of  all  pharmacy prescriptions. This high degree of consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mailorder pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers from our business. Each of CVS, Express Scripts and United Health G roup (among the top six integrated health plans and PBMs) have Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their leverage to negotiate deeper discounts on their behalf and for the benefit of their other customers. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage changes, plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse",

      "question": "How did the 13% increase in Optum's earnings from operations from 2022 to 2023 reflect the earlier year's operational challenges, and what role did Optum's segment performance play in offsetting UnitedHealthcare's margin pressures in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UNH's earnings from operations were negatively impacted by increased care costs and the lingering effects of the pandemic, particularly in the UnitedHealthcare segment. Despite these challenges, Optum's earnings from operations increased by 13% in 2023, from $14.056 billion to $15.943 billion, driven by strong performance across its three business units: Optum Health (9% increase in earnings), Optum Insight (19% increase), and Optum Rx (15% increase). This growth in Optum's earnings helped offset margin pressures in UnitedHealthcare, where the operating margin remained flat at 5.8% in 2023 despite a $31.6 billion revenue increase. Optum\u2019s overall operating margin, although slightly down from 7.7% to 7.0%, still contributed significantly to the consolidated earnings growth of 14% in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "\nCommercial business increased primarily due to acquisitions in risk-based and fee-based offerings and organic growth in innovative products. Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans.\n\nUnitedHealthcare's revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits, partially offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business. Earnings from operations decreased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business, partially offset by higher temporary deferral of care and growth in people served across our domestic businesses.\n\n## Optum\n\nTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows:\n\n## Optum Health\n\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based arrangements, acquisitions in care delivery and the impact of COVID-19 at our fee-based businesses as consumers resumed elective care. Earnings from operations increased due to the factors impacting revenues as well as cost management initiatives and increased investment income. COVID-19 related care costs and temporary care deferrals affected earnings from operations at our value-based and fee-based businesses in offsetting manners. Optum Health served approximately 100 million people as of December 31, 2021 compared to 98 million people as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Optum Insight\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in technology and managed services, including expanding relationships serving health systems. Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives.\n\n## Optum Rx\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain and cost management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion adjusted scripts in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition to the factors contributing to revenue growth, adjusted scripts also increased due to the dispensing of COVID-19 vaccines.",

This disruption likely hindered the realization of a portion of the backlog, particularly in services tied to the affected systems, despite the strong pipeline of signed contracts. The cyberattack led to service outages, delayed transactions, and increased response costs, which collectively reduced the expected revenue conversion from the backlog.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Part II Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.' Readers are cautioned the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nDiscussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## General\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two businesses:\n\n- Optum Health;\n- Optum Insight;\n- Optum Rx; and\n- UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State.\n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, 'Business' and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Change Healthcare Cyberattack\n\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers.\n\nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser ex tent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\n\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals' information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.",

      "question": "How did the changes in CVS's Corporate/Other segment strategy from 2023 to 2024 influence the company's office real estate optimization charges, and what does this reveal about the evolution of its flexible work arrangements and cost management initiatives?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CVS's Corporate/Other segment reported office real estate optimization charges of $46 million, primarily reflecting the company's early-stage evaluation of corporate office space in response to flexible work arrangements. By 2024, these charges were still present but had evolved as part of a broader restructuring effort aimed at streamlining operations and reducing costs. The continued presence of these charges indicates that CVS was actively managing its real estate footprint in alignment with its flexible work strategy, while also integrating recent acquisitions like Signify Health and Oak Street Health. This demonstrates a strategic shift from initial exploration to active implementation of cost containment through real estate optimization.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CVS(2023) \u2192 Corporate & Other: CVS's 2023 10-K shows the company had adopted a new operating model and segment structure, with Corporate/Other serving as a distinct segment managing non-operational functions and integration costs.",
        "Hop 2: Corporate & Other \u2192 Office Real Estate Optimization Charges: In 2023, the Corporate/Other segment incurred $46 million in office real estate optimization charges, reflecting the company's early evaluation of corporate office space in response to flexible work arrangements.",
        "Hop 3: Office Real Estate Optimization Charges \u2190 CVS(2024): In 2024, the charges continued and were explicitly tied to the company's ongoing flexible work strategy, indicating a deeper integration of this cost management initiative into broader restructuring efforts."

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's adjusted operating income in the Pharmacy Services segment was positively impacted by improved purchasing economics from group purchasing organization activities and specialty pharmacy services, despite price compression pressures. By 2024, the Corporate & Other segment's adjusted operating loss decreased from $1.6 billion to $1.3 billion. This reduction in loss coincided with ongoing competitive pressures in the PBM industry that continued to drive CVS to share more rebates with clients and face limitations on retail network 'differential' pricing. The Pharmacy Services segment's adjusted operating income performance, which was influenced by these rebate-sharing dynamics and regulatory changes, appears to have indirectly contributed to the improved financial position of the Corporate & Other segment over this period.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company's segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for 24%, 19% and 18%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company's segments to the consolidated totals:",

      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ reported an amortization of prior service cost of $184 million for its retirement plans, and this figure remained unchanged in 2024. Despite the 2021 announcement that all eligible U.S. non-union employees would transition to the Retirement Value formula by 2026, the consistent amortization amount suggests that the company's long-term pension obligation strategy had not yet materially shifted in 2023\u20132024. The unchanged amortization indicates that the company continued to manage legacy liabilities under the Final Average Pay formula while preparing for the broader implementation of the new formula in 2026.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Optum Health's patient base from 2022 to 2023 translate into changes in UNH's earnings from operations, and what were the key cost or revenue drivers behind this shift?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UNH's Optum Health segment served approximately 102 million people, and its earnings from operations were $6.032 billion. By 2023, the patient base grew to 103 million, and earnings from operations increased to $6.560 billion\u2014a $528 million rise. This growth was driven by organic expansion under value-based care arrangements and business combinations, which boosted revenues. However, the operating margin for Optum Health declined from 8.5% in 2022 to 6.9% in 2023, indicating that the earnings growth was partially offset by higher costs associated with serving newly added patients and increased outpatient and behavioral health care activity. Thus, while patient growth contributed positively to earnings, cost pressures moderated the margin improvement.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UNH(2022) \u2192 Optum Health: UNH's 2022 performance was closely tied to Optum Health, which served 102 million people and contributed $6.032 billion in earnings from operations.",
        "Hop 2: Optum Health \u2192 Earnings from Operations: Optum Health's 2023 earnings from operations rose to $6.560 billion due to patient growth under value-based arrangements and cost management, despite increased care costs.",
        "Hop 3: Earnings from Operations \u2190 UNH(2023): The increase in Optum Health\u2019s earnings contributed to UNH\u2019s overall consolidated earnings from operations rising to $32.358 billion in 2023 from $28.435 billion in 2022."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ndemand for other services does not increase as we expect or declines, or if we lose accounts with more profitable products while retaining or increasing membership in accounts with less profitable products.\n\n## If we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care payers, physicians, hospitals and other service providers, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe depend substantially on our continued ability to contract with health care payers (as a service provider to those payers), as well as physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and other service providers at competitive prices. Any failure by us to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with health care providers, whether innetwork or out-of-network, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, certain activities related to network design, provider participation in networks and provider payments could result in disputes, which may be costly, divert management's attention from our operations and result in negative publicity.\n\nIn any particular market, physicians and health care providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher medical costs, less desirable products for customers or difficulty meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements. In some markets, certain health care providers, particularly hospitals, physician and hospital organizations or multi-specialty physician groups, may have significant market positions or near monopolies which could result in diminished bargaining power on our part. In addition, ACOs; practice management companies (which aggregate physician practices for administrative efficiency); and other organizational structures adopted by physicians, hospitals and other care providers may change the way in which these providers do business with us and may change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which could adversely affect our business, and our results of operations, financial position and cash flows by impacting our relationships with these providers or affecting the way we price our products and estimate our costs, which might require us to incur costs to change our operations. In addition, if these providers refuse to contract with us, use their market position to negotiate favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, our ability to market products or to be profitable in those areas could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nOur health care benefits businesses have risk-based arrangements with some physicians, hospitals and other health care providers. These arrangements limit our exposure to the risk of increasing medical costs, but expose us to risk related to the adequacy of the financial and medical care resources of the health care provider. To the extent a risk-based health care provider organization faces financial difficulties or otherwise is unable to perform its obligations under the arrangement, we may be held responsible for unpaid health care claims which should have been the responsibility of the health care provider and for which we have already paid the provider. Further, payment or other disputes between a primary care provider and specialists with whom the primary care provider contracts could result in a disruption in the provision of services to our members or a reduction in the services available to our members. Health care providers with which we contract may not properly manage the costs of services, maintain financial solvency or avoid disputes with other providers. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on the provision of services to our members and our operations.\n\nSome providers render services to our members who do not have contracts with us. In those cases, we do not have a pre-established understanding about the amount of compensation due to the provider for services rendered to our members. In some states, the amount of compensation due to these out-of-network providers is defined by law or regulation, but in other cases the amount is either not defined or is established by a standard which does not clearly specify dollar terms. In some instances, providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with us.\n\nThe success of some of our businesses, including Optum Health and UnitedHealthcare Global, depend on maintaining satisfactory relationships with physicians as our employees, independent contractors or joint venture partners. The physicians who practice medicine or contract with our affiliated physician organizations could terminate their provider contracts or otherwise become unable or unwilling to continue practicing medicine or contracting with us. We face and will likely continue to face heightened competition in the markets where we operate to acquire or manage physician practices or to employ or contract with individual physicians. If we are unable to maintain or grow satisfactory relationships with physicians, or to acquire, recruit or, in some instances, employ physicians, or to retain enrollees following the departure of a physician, our revenues could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, our affiliated physician organizations contract with competitors of UnitedHealthcare. Our businesses could suffer if our affiliated physician organizations fail to maintain relationships with these companies, or fail to adequately price their contracts with these third-party payers.\n\nIn addition, physicians, hospitals, pharmaceutical benefit service providers, pharmaceutical manufacturers and certain health care providers are customers of our Optum businesses. Physicians also provide medical services at facilities owned by our Optum businesses. Given the importance of health care providers and other constituents to our businesses, failure to maintain satisfactory relationships with them could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CVS incurred $132 million in acquisition-related integration costs within the Corporate/Other segment related to the Signify Health and Oak Street Health acquisitions. These costs carried into 2024, indicating that integration challenges persisted beyond the initial acquisition phase. Specifically, 2024 integration costs were tied to operational alignment efforts such as corporate workforce optimization, store impairment charges, and discontinuation of non-core assets, suggesting that aligning the newly acquired entities with CVS\u2019s internal structure and strategic focus proved complex. This continuity of costs across years highlights that the integration involved more than just transactional execution\u2014it required sustained restructuring and resource reallocation, particularly within the Corporate/Other segment.",

      "answer": "Abbott Laboratories maintained a consistent 4.3% expected aggregate average long-term change in compensation in the years leading up to 2022, as shown in their 2022 10-K filing. However, by 2024, this metric had increased to 4.6%, reflecting a deliberate adjustment in their long-term compensation assumptions. This upward revision suggests that Abbott anticipated higher wage growth, potentially due to market pressures, talent retention strategies, or broader inflationary trends affecting labor costs. The change indicates a strategic recalibration in how Abbott plans for and budgets long-term employee compensation within its financial forecasting models.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "answer": "Amgen's sales deductions rose from 51% in 2022 to 53% in 2023, driven by higher U.S. chargeback and commercial rebate discount rates, which directly impacted ENBREL sales by reducing net selling prices. This trend continued into 2024, where ENBREL sales declined further due to ongoing reductions in net selling price, including the looming impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price cuts set to begin in 2026. Thus, the rising sales deductions in 2023 contributed to the downward pressure on ENBREL sales in 2024, compounding the effects of market dynamics and regulatory changes.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Optum Health served approximately 103 million people, up from 102 million in 2022, with the increase largely driven by organic growth under value-based care arrangements. This growth contributed to higher operational earnings, which included increased investment income. In 2024, UNH had $33 billion in financial assets sensitive to interest rate changes, meaning that the prior year's growth in Optum Health's patient base likely amplified the company's exposure to investment income volatility due to market interest rate fluctuations. The evolution of this relationship highlights how Optum Health's operational expansion directly impacted financial performance levers like investment income, which became more sensitive to macroeconomic conditions in the following year.",

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur primary market risks are exposures to changes in interest rates impacting our investment income and interest expense and the fair value of certain of our fixed-rate investments and debt.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $33 billion of financial assets on which the interest rates received vary with market interest rates, which may significantly impact our investment income. Also as of December 31, 2024, $27 billion of our financial liabilities, which include debt and deposit liabilities, were at interest rates which vary with market rates, either directly or through the use of related interest rate swap contracts.\n\nThe fair value of our fix ed-rate investments and debt also varies with market interest rates. As of December 31, 2024, $46 billion of our investments were fix ed-rate debt securities and $49 billion of our debt was non-swapped fixed-rate term debt. An increase in market interest rates decreases the market value of fixed-rate investments and fixed-rate debt. Conversely, a decrease in market interest rates increases the market value of fix ed-rate investments and fix ed-rate debt.\n\nWe manage exposure to market interest rates by diversifying investments across different fixed-income market sectors and debt across maturities, as well as by matching a portion of our floating-rate assets and liabilities, either directly or through the use of interest rate swap contracts. Unrealized gains and losses on investments in available-for-sale debt securities are reported in comprehensive income.\n\nThe following tables summarize the impact of hypothetical changes in market interest rates across the entire yield curve by 1% point or 2% points as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 on our investment income and interest expense per annum and the fair value of our investments and debt (in millions, except percentages):\n\n",

      "answer": "The $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the LTC reporting unit during the third quarter of 2021, driven by customer losses and pandemic-related occupancy declines, resulted in the complete write-off of goodwill for the unit as of December 31, 2021. By the 2023 reporting year, there was no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit, and no additional impairment charges were recorded for indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2023. Despite the absence of new impairments, the unit continued to face financial challenges, as evidenced by ongoing customer losses and the adverse impact of the pandemic, which significantly affected its ability to grow as originally projected in 2020.",

          "chunk_text": "\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by a goodwill impairment charge related to the LTC reporting unit within the Retail/LTC segment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the decrease in the carrying amount of goodwill was primarily driven by the divestiture of the Workers' Compensation business, partially offset by goodwill associated with immaterial acquisitions. See Note 2 ''Divestitures'' for further discussion regarding the Workers' Compensation business divestiture.\n\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company performed its required annual impairment tests of goodwill. The results of the impairment tests indicated an impairment of the goodwill associated with the LTC reporting unit, as the reporting unit's carrying value exceeded its fair value as of the testing date. The results of the impairment tests of the remaining reporting units indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill as of the testing date.\n\nDuring 2021, the LTC reporting unit has continued to face challenges that have impacted the Company's ability to grow the LTC reporting unit's business at the rate estimated when its 2020 goodwill impairment test was performed. These challenges include lower net facility admissions, net long-term care facility customer losses and the prolonged adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the emerging new variants, which resulted in more significant declines in occupancy rates experienced by the Company's long-term care facility customers than previously anticipated. During the third quarter of 2021, LTC management updated their 2021 annual forecast and submitted their long-term plan which showed deterioration in the financial results for the remainder of 2021 and beyond. The Company utilized these updated projections in performing its annual impairment test, which indicated that the fair value of the LTC reporting unit was lower than its carrying value, resulting in a $431 million goodwill impairment charge in the third quarter of 2021. The fair value of the LTC reporting unit was determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow method and a market multiple method. As of December 31, 2021, there was no remaining goodwill balance in the LTC reporting unit. During the third quarter of 2021, the Company also performed an impairment test of the intangible assets of the LTC reporting unit and concluded these assets were not impaired. As of December 31, 2021, there was $2.7 billion of intangible assets related to customer lists in the LTC reporting unit.",

This trend continued into 2023, where ENBREL sales again declined due to similar factors\u2014lower net selling price, reduced inventory, and unfavorable changes in estimated sales deductions. The recurrence of this pattern across both years indicates a persistent challenge in Amgen's pricing and reimbursement environment, particularly in the U.S., where patients face higher co-pays and deductible-related pressures during the early part of the year. The consistent negative impact of sales deductions on ENBREL revenue suggests that Amgen may be facing increasing rebate pressures or payer restrictions, which are eroding net realized prices despite gross sales.",

          "chunk_text": "## AMGEN INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n## December 31, 2021\n\n## 1. Summary of significant accounting policies\n\n## Business\n\nAmgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as 'Amgen,' 'the Company,' 'we,' 'our' or 'us') is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. We operate in one business segment: human therapeutics.\n\n## Principles of consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amgen as well as its majority-owned subsidiaries. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity, we consider whether we have both the power to direct activities of the entity that most significantly impact the entity's economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of, or the right to receive benefits  from,  the  entity  that  could  potentially  be  significant  to  that  entity. We  do  not  have  any  significant  interests  in  any  variable interest entities of which we are the primary beneficiary. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Use of estimates\n\nThe  preparation  of  consolidated  financial  statements  in  conformity  with  GAAP  requires  management  to  make  estimates  and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues\n\n## Product sales and sales deductions\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale.\n\nWe analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that an adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given period, can be affected by the mix of products sold. Included in sales deductions are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-period sales due to changes in estimates.\n\nReturns are estimated through comparison of historical return data with their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product,  when  appropriate.  Historically,  sales  return  provisions  have  amounted  to  less  than  1%  of  gross  product  sales.  Changes  in estimates for prior-period sales return provisions have historically been immaterial.\n\nOur  payment  terms  vary  by  types  and  locations  of  customers  and  by  products  or  services  offered.  Payment  terms  differ  by jurisdiction and customer, but payment is generally required in a term ranging from 30 to 120 days from date of shipment or satisfaction of the performance obligation. For certain products or services and certain customer types, we may require payment before products are delivered or services are rendered to customers.\n\nIndirect taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities that are related to sales of the Company's products, primarily in Europe, are excluded from revenues.\n\nAs a practical expedient, sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in SG&amp;A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Abbott's Diagnostics segment reported Additions to Property and Equipment at $750 million, which increased slightly to $758 million in 2024. This modest increase suggests a sustained but cautious investment approach in the Diagnostics segment. Over the same period, the total assets for Diagnostics decreased from $7,767 million in 2023 to $7,678 million in 2024, indicating that despite continued capital additions, the segment experienced asset depreciation or divestments that outpaced these investments. This reflects a potential strategic shift toward optimizing existing assets rather than aggressive expansion.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Health Care Benefits segment anticipated a decrease in its Medical Benefit Ratio (MBR) due to improved pricing and reduced costs related to the pandemic, despite continued pressure from Medicaid membership declines. This expectation was grounded in the belief that membership shifts\u2014growing in Medicare and commercial plans while declining in Medicaid\u2014would lead to more favorable cost dynamics. In 2023, this expectation materialized in part through an observed increase in completion factors relative to prior estimates, which led to a $55 million reduction in health care costs payable that year. These improved actuarial estimates, combined with the structural shift in membership mix, contributed to a $39 million (15.7%) year-over-year decrease in total health care costs, as reported in 2023 financial results. This reflects a direct temporal and causal chain: strategic and demographic shifts in 2022 laid the groundwork for cost containment improvements realized in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Outlook for 2022\n\nWith respect to 2022, the Company believes you should consider the following important information:\n\n- The Health Care Benefits segment is expected to benefit from Medicare and Commercial membership growth, partially offset by membership declines in its Medicaid products. The projected MBR is expected to decrease compared to 2021, reflecting a combination of expected improved pricing and a reduction in COVID-19 related medical costs. While the Company still expects a net negative impact from COVID-19 in 2022 within the Health Care Benefits segment, the expectation is the impact will be less adverse than what was experienced in 2021.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment is expected to benefit from the Company's ability to drive further improvements in purchasing economics and continued growth in specialty pharmacy, partially offset by continued price compression and state regulation of pharmacy pricing.\n- The Retail/LTC segment is expected to continue to benefit from increased prescription volume and improved generic drug purchasing, partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and incremental operating expenses associated with the Company's minimum wage investment. The Company expects that COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing will continue in 2022, albeit at lower levels than those experienced during 2021. The Company expects to see continued strength in Front Store sales, including sales of OTC test kits, in 2022. The extent of COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales will be dependent upon various factors including vaccine hesitancy, the emergence of new variants, government testing initiatives and the availability and administration of pediatric and booster vaccinations.\n- The Company is expected to benefit from the continuation of its enterprise-wide cost savings initiatives, which aim to reduce the Company's operating cost structure in a way that improves the consumer experience and is sustainable. Key drivers include:\n- Investments in digital, technology and analytics capabilities that will streamline processes and improve outcomes,\n- Implementing workforce and workplace strategies, and\n- Deploying vendor and procurement strategies.\n- The Company expects changes to its business environment to continue as elected and other government officials at the national and state levels continue to propose and enact significant modifications to public policy and existing laws and regulations that govern or impact the Company's businesses.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the economies of the U.S. and other countries around the world. The Company believes COVID-19's impact on its businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition primarily will be driven by the geographies impacted and the severity and duration of the pandemic, as well as the pandemic's impact on the U.S. and global economies, global supply chain, consumer behavior, and health care utilization patterns. In addition, as described in the 'Government Regulation' section of this Form 10-K, federal, state and local governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 and emerging new variants may not effectively combat the severity and/or duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and have resulted in a myriad of impacts on the Company's businesses. Those primary drivers are beyond the Company's knowledge and control. As a result, the impact COVID-19 will have on the Company's businesses, operating results, cash flows and/or financial condition is uncertain, but the impact could be adverse and material.\n\nThe Company's current expectations described above are forward-looking statements. Please see 'Risk Factors' included in Item 1A of this 10-K and the 'Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements' in this 10-K for information regarding important factors that may cause the Company's actual results to differ from those currently projected and/or otherwise materially affect the Company.",

      "answer": "From 2021 to 2023, Johnson & Johnson increased its Additions to Property, Plant & Equipment for the MedTech segment from $1,933 million to $2,372 million, reflecting a growing capital investment focus. This trend supported the MedTech segment\u2019s strategic repositioning, especially after the Consumer Health business was spun off in Q3 2023. By 2024, the company was organized into only two segments\u2014Innovative Medicine and MedTech\u2014indicating a sharpened corporate focus. The increased investment in MedTech infrastructure likely strengthened the segment's operational capacity and strategic importance within the post-spinoff organizational structure.",

Segments of business and geographic areas\n\nFollowing the separation of the Consumer Health business in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, the Company is now organized into two reportable segments: Innovative M edicine and M edTech. The segment results have been recast for all periods to reflect the continuing operations of the Company.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (CODM ) is the Chief Executive Officer (Principal Executive Officer). For the Innovative M edicine and M edTech segments, the CODM uses segment income before tax to allocate resources (including employees, financial, and capital resources) for each segment predominantly in the annual forecasting process. The CODM  considers planning-to-actual variances on a quarterly basis to assess performance and make decisions about allocating resources to the segments.\n\n",

      "question": "How did the restructuring of JNJ's MedTech segment in 2023, including a $319 million pre-tax expense, influence the growth trajectory of JNJ's International Sales in 2024, given that MedTech segment sales had increased by 7.7% internationally in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ initiated a restructuring of its MedTech segment, incurring a $319 million pre-tax expense, aimed at streamlining operations by exiting certain markets and product lines. Despite this restructuring, the MedTech segment achieved a 7.7% increase in international sales in 2023. However, in 2024, the international sales growth slowed to 2.0% for the Pulmonary Hypertension franchise and showed mixed performance across other segments, suggesting that while the restructuring initially supported growth, its long-term impact may have introduced operational adjustments that affected international sales momentum.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Optum Insight's revenues from $14.581 billion in 2022 to $18.932 billion in 2023 influence UnitedHealth Group's overall earnings from operations, and what does this suggest about the strategic contribution of Optum Insight within the broader Optum business segment?",
      "answer": "The increase in Optum Insight's revenues from $14.581 billion in 2022 to $18.932 billion in 2023 contributed to the overall growth in UnitedHealth Group's earnings from operations, which rose from $28.435 billion in 2022 to $32.358 billion in 2023. This growth trajectory indicates that Optum Insight played a meaningful role in driving profitability for the broader Optum business segment, despite experiencing a decline in operating margin from 24.6% in 2022 to 22.5% in 2023. The significant revenue growth suggests that Optum Insight's data and analytics offerings remained a strategic lever for UnitedHealth Group, supporting its long-term contracts and backlog, which stood at $22.4 billion as of the end of 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment contributed $6.5 billion in adjusted operating income, indicating a strong performance. However, in 2024, this segment faced challenges such as continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure, decreased front store volume, and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, which collectively led to an 3.2% decline in adjusted operating income compared to 2023. Despite a 4.0% increase in prescriptions filled and a 12.3% growth in pharmacy same-store sales driven by vaccinations and branded GLP-1 drugs, these gains were offset by reimbursement pressures and reduced consumer demand in the front store. The segment's adjusted operating income, which had been a strong contributor in 2023, thus became a source of financial strain in 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion should be read together with the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements thereto included in Part II Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.' Readers are cautioned the statements, estimates, projections or outlook contained in this report, including discussions regarding financial prospects, economic conditions, trends and uncertainties contained in this Item 7, may constitute forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the PSLRA. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties which may cause our actual results to differ materially from the ex pectations ex pressed or implied in the forward-looking statements. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found further below in this Item 7 and in Part I, Item 1A, 'Risk Factors.'\n\nDiscussions of year-over-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 are not included in this Form 10-K and can be found in Part II, Item 7, 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\n\n## EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\n\n## General\n\nUnitedHealth Group is a health care and well-being company with a mission to help people live healthier lives and help make the health system work better for everyone. Our two distinct, yet complementary businesses - Optum and UnitedHealthcare - are working to help build a modern, high-performing health system through improved access, affordability, outcomes and experiences for the individuals and organizations we are privileged to serve.\n\nWe have four reportable segments across our two businesses:\n\n- Optum Health;\n- Optum Insight;\n- Optum Rx; and\n- UnitedHealthcare, which includes UnitedHealthcare Employer &amp; Individual, UnitedHealthcare Medicare &amp; Retirement and UnitedHealthcare Community &amp; State.\n\nFurther information on our business and reportable segments is presented in Part I, Item 1, 'Business' and in Note 14 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, 'Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## Change Healthcare Cyberattack\n\nAs previously announced, on February 21, 2024, we identified that cybercrime threat actors had gained access to certain Change Healthcare information technology systems. Upon detection of this outside threat, we isolated the impacted systems to protect our partners and customers.\n\nWe have substantially mitigated the impact to consumers and care providers of the unprecedented cyberattack on the U.S. health system and restored or replaced the majority of the affected Change Healthcare services. To support care providers we provided interest-free loans of more than $9 billion through December 31, 2024. For the year ended December 31, 2024, we incurred $2.2 billion of direct response costs, including costs associated with providing interest-free loans; increased medical care expenditures, as we suspended some care management activities to help care providers with their workflow processes; network restoration; and notifications of impacted persons. Optum Insight also experienced estimated business disruption impacts of $867 million for the year ended December 31, 2024, reflecting lost revenue while maintaining full readiness of the affected Change Healthcare services. We expect to continue to incur direct response costs and experience business disruption impacts at a lesser ex tent in 2025 as we work to bring transaction volumes back to pre-event levels and win new business.\n\nWe have determined the estimated total number of individuals impacted by the Change Healthcare cyberattack is approximately 190 million. The vast majority of those people have already been provided individual or substitute notice. The final number will be confirmed and filed with the Office for Civil Rights. Change Healthcare is not aware of any misuse of individuals' information as a result of this incident and has not seen electronic medical record databases appear in the data during the analysis. It is possible that future risks and uncertainties resulting from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, including risks related to impacted data, litigation, reputational harm, and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.",

      "question": "How did the impact of a 1% decrease in market interest rates on UNH's fair value of financial liabilities change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's sensitivity to interest rate fluctuations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, a 1% decrease in market interest rates resulted in a $5,391 fair value increase in UNH's financial liabilities, while in 2024, the same 1% decrease led to a $5,831 fair value increase. This shows that UNH's financial liabilities became more sensitive to interest rate declines over time, with a $440 increase in fair value sensitivity. The relationship between market interest rates and fair value of financial liabilities remained negatively correlated, but the magnitude of the impact grew, indicating a stronger sensitivity in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CVS reported a $1 million loss in Net Investment Income, which was a negligible component of its financial structure and not integrated into segment reporting. By 2024, Net Investment Income had shifted dramatically to contribute $406 million within the Corporate & Other segment, indicating a strategic realignment of investment activities. This change aligns with CVS's emphasis on adjusted operating income as a key performance metric, as the Corporate & Other segment's financial impact is now more directly tied to investment performance, suggesting a broader integration of investment returns into core business evaluation.",

        "Hop 1: CVS(2023) \u2192 Net Investment Income (Loss): Reported a $1 million loss, treated as a standalone financial item outside segment reporting",

        "Hop 3: Corporate & Other \u2190 CVS(2024): Corporate & Other is now formally recognized as a reportable segment evaluated based on adjusted operating income, with investment income playing a material role"

Segment Reporting\n\nThe Company has four reportable segments: Health Care Benefits, Health Services, Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness and Corporate/Other. The Company's segments maintain separate financial information, and the CODM, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, evaluates the segments' operating results on a regular basis in deciding how to allocate resources among the segments and in assessing segment performance. The CODM evaluates the performance of the Company's segments based on adjusted operating income. Total assets by segment are not used by the CODM to assess the performance of, or allocate resources to, the Company's segments, therefore total assets by segment are not disclosed.\n\nAdjusted operating income (loss) is defined as operating income (loss) (GAAP measure) excluding the impact of amortization of intangible assets, net realized capital gains or losses, and other items, if any, that neither relate to the ordinary course of the Company's business nor reflect the Company's underlying business performance. The CODM uses adjusted operating income as its principal measure of segment performance as it enhances the Company's ability to compare past financial performance with current performance and analyze underlying business performance and trends. Non-GAAP financial measures the Company discloses, such as consolidated adjusted operating income, should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures determined or calculated in accordance with GAAP.\n\nIn 2024, 2023 and 2022, revenues from the federal government accounted for 24%, 19% and 18%, respectively, of the Company's consolidated total revenues, primarily related to contracts with CMS for coverage of Medicare-eligible individuals within the Health Care Benefits segment.\n\nThe following is a reconciliation of financial measures of the Company's segments to the consolidated totals:",

      "question": "How did the operating margin performance of Optum in 2023 versus 2024 reflect the changes in UNH's strategic positioning through its segment structure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UNH's Optum segment reported an operating margin of 7.0%, which decreased to 6.6% in 2024, signaling a decline in profitability for this key segment despite overall revenue growth from $226.6 billion to $252.9 billion. This margin contraction was primarily driven by a significant drop in Optum Insight's operating margin from 22.5% in 2023 to 16.5% in 2024, which offset gains in Optum Health's margin (6.9% to 7.4%). Despite this, UNH maintained a stable consolidated operating margin of 8.1% in 2024, suggesting that the company offset Optum's margin pressure through performance in other segments, particularly UnitedHealthcare, which stabilized after a slight margin decline from 5.8% to 5.2%.",

        "Hop 1: UNH(2023) \u2192 Optum: UNH reported Optum as a key business segment with $226.6 billion in revenue and a 7.0% operating margin",

        "Hop 3: Operating margin \u2190 UNH(2024): Despite the Optum margin decline, UNH maintained a consolidated operating margin of 8.1% in 2024, showing strategic balance across segments"

      "question": "How did the decline in UnitedHealthcare's operating margin from 6.2% in 2022 to 5.4% in 2023 relate to changes in the consolidated operating margin, and what does this indicate about the segment's contribution to overall profitability?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UNH reported a consolidated operating margin of 8.7%, with the UnitedHealthcare segment contributing 6.2%. By 2023, the UnitedHealthcare segment's operating margin dropped to 5.4%, while the consolidated operating margin for UNH decreased to 8.3%. This indicates that the UnitedHealthcare segment experienced a sharper decline in profitability compared to the overall company performance. The drop in UnitedHealthcare's operating margin suggests that this segment became less profitable year-over-year and contributed less favorably to the company's overall operating margin. This temporal chain reveals a shift in the segment's financial health relative to the broader organization.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS reported $274 million in acquisitions under the Health Care Benefits segment, indicating initial investment activity. By 2023, the company disclosed a $61 million negative acquisition purchase price adjustment related to these acquisitions, suggesting that the final valuation of the acquired assets was lower than initially estimated. This adjustment reflects a recalibration of the acquisition value post-closing, likely due to updated assessments of the acquired entities' financial performance or market conditions. The chain shows how initial acquisition spending in 2022 evolved into a downward valuation adjustment in 2023 through the Health Care Benefits segment.",

In 2022, Optum Rx reported 1.4 billion adjusted scripts, with earnings growth attributed to supply chain and cost management initiatives. By 2024, despite the disruption from the Change Healthcare cyberattack, Optum Rx increased adjusted scripts to 1.623 billion and reported higher earnings from operations, citing continued supply chain improvements and operating cost efficiencies.

Medicare Advantage increased due to growth in people served through individual and group Medicare Advantage plans. The increase in people served through Medicaid was primarily driven by states continuing to ease redetermination requirements due to COVID-19, new state-based awards and growth in people served through Dual Special Needs Plans.\n\nUnitedHealthcare's revenues increased due to growth in the number of individuals served through Medicare Advantage and Medicaid, including a greater mix of people with higher acuity needs, and an increase in the number of individuals served through commercial benefits, partially offset by the permanent repeal of the Health Insurance Tax and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business. Earnings from operations decreased due to increased COVID-19 related care costs and the impacts of COVID-19 on risk adjusted business, partially offset by higher temporary deferral of care and growth in people served across our domestic businesses.\n\n## Optum\n\nTotal revenues and earnings from operations increased due to growth across the Optum businesses. The results by segment were as follows:\n\n## Optum Health\n\nRevenues at Optum Health increased primarily due to organic growth in value-based arrangements, acquisitions in care delivery and the impact of COVID-19 at our fee-based businesses as consumers resumed elective care. Earnings from operations increased due to the factors impacting revenues as well as cost management initiatives and increased investment income. COVID-19 related care costs and temporary care deferrals affected earnings from operations at our value-based and fee-based businesses in offsetting manners. Optum Health served approximately 100 million people as of December 31, 2021 compared to 98 million people as of December 31, 2020.\n\n## Optum Insight\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Insight increased due to growth in technology and managed services, including expanding relationships serving health systems. Earnings from operations also increased due to productivity gains and cost management initiatives.\n\n## Optum Rx\n\nRevenues and earnings from operations at Optum Rx increased due to higher script volumes from growth in people served, increased utilization and organic growth in pharmacy care services. Earnings from operations also increased as a result of continued supply chain and cost management initiatives. Optum Rx fulfilled 1.4 billion and 1.3 billion adjusted scripts in 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition to the factors contributing to revenue growth, adjusted scripts also increased due to the dispensing of COVID-19 vaccines.",

      "answer": "In 2023, ABBV's R&D expense percentage increased due in part to a $630 million intangible asset impairment charge primarily linked to its general pipeline assets. By 2024, the R&D expense percentage rose further, with a significantly larger $4.5 billion impairment charge specifically tied to emraclidine, indicating a strategic or developmental setback in that key asset. This evolution shows how impairment charges shifted from a broad pipeline impact to a concentrated issue around a single drug, amplifying the effect on R&D expense percentage. The specific nature of the 2024 impairment suggests a more targeted challenge in ABBV's R&D strategy compared to the broader pipeline pressures seen in 2023.",

      "answer": "The 109% increase in UnitedHealth Group's total operating costs from $2,231 million in 2022 to $4,652 million in 2024 reflects a significant escalation in the company's cost structure, with medical costs being a key contributing factor. The 2022 filing explicitly warned that adverse economic conditions could increase medical costs by impacting provider contracting rates, which would negatively affect performance. By 2024, medical costs were formally disclosed as a core component of total operating costs, and the sharp rise in these costs over the two-year period aligns with the earlier risk warnings. This suggests that the company experienced growing pressure from medical expenses, which became a more prominent driver of overall operating costs and likely affected profitability and strategic planning.",

Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources to the acquired businesses before we realize anticipated synergies or other benefits from the acquired businesses. These challenges vary widely by country and, outside of the United States, may include political instability, government intervention, discriminatory regulation and currency exchange controls or other restrictions, which could prevent us from transferring funds from these operations out of the countries in which our acquired businesses operate, or converting local currencies we hold into U.S. dollars or other currencies. If we are unable to manage successfully our non-U.S. acquisitions, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial position could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nForeign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on our shareholders' equity from period to period, which could adversely affect our debt to debt-plus-equity ratio, and our future revenues, costs and cash flows from international operations. Any measures we may implement to reduce the effect of volatile currencies may be costly or ineffective.\n\n## Our sales performance will suffer if we do not adequately attract, retain and provide support to a network of independent producers and consultants.\n\nOur products and services are sold in part through nonexclusive producers and consultants for whose services and allegiance we must compete. Our sales would be materially and adversely affected if we are unable to attract, retain and support such independent producers and consultants or if our sales strategy is not appropriately aligned across distribution channels. Our relationships with producers could be materially and adversely impacted by changes in our business practices and the nature of our relationships to address these pressures, including potential reductions in commission levels.\n\n## Unfavorable economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our revenues and our results of operations.\n\nUnfavorable economic conditions may impact demand for certain of our products and services. For example, high unemployment during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused lower enrollment or lower rates of renewal in our employer group benefits and pharmacy services plans. Unfavorable economic conditions also have caused and could continue to cause employers to stop offering certain health care coverage as an employee benefit or elect to offer this coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis as a means to reduce their operating costs. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact our ability to increase premiums or result in the cancellation by certain customers of our products and services. These conditions could lead to a decrease in our membership levels and premium and fee revenues and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nDuring a prolonged unfavorable economic environment, state and federal budgets could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in reduced reimbursements or payments in our federal and state government health care coverage programs, including Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. A reduction in state Medicaid reimbursement rates could be implemented retroactively to apply to payments already negotiated or received from the government and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, state and federal budgetary pressures could cause the affected governments to impose new or a higher level of taxes or assessments for our commercial programs, such as premium taxes on health insurance and surcharges or fees on select fee-for-service and capitated medical claims. Any of these developments or actions could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\n\nA prolonged unfavorable economic environment also could adversely impact the financial position of hospitals and other care providers which could materially and adversely affect our contracted rates with these parties and increase our medical costs or materially and adversely affect their ability to purchase our service offerings. Further, unfavorable economic conditions could adversely impact the customers of our Optum businesses, including health plans, hospitals, care providers, employers and others which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect Optum's financial results.\n\n## Our failure to attract, develop, retain, and manage the succession of key employees and executives could adversely affect our business, results of operations and future performance.\n\nWe are dependent on our ability to attract, develop and retain qualified employees and executives, including those with diverse backgrounds, experiences and skill sets, to operate and expand our business. Experienced and highly skilled employees and executives in the health care and technology industries are in high demand and the market for their services is extremely competitive. We may have difficulty in replacing key executives because of the limited number of qualified individuals in these industries with the breadth of skills and experience required to operate and successfully expand our business. Adverse changes to our corporate culture, which seeks to foster integrity, compassion, relationships, innovation and performance, could harm our business operations and our ability to retain key employees and executives. While we have development and succession plans in place for our key employees and executives, these plans do not guarantee the services of our key employees and executives",

By 2024, the total restructuring expenses had significantly decreased to $269 million, with the Innovative Medicine segment contributing only $102 million.

      "answer": "The increase in DHR's medical trend rate from 5.9% in 2023 to 7.7% in 2024 directly affected the calculation of the postretirement benefit obligation. While both years project the rate decreasing to stabilize at 4.0% (by 2048 in 2023 and 2049 in 2024), the higher starting point in 2024 suggests a near-term upward pressure on benefit obligations.

By 2024, adjusted operating income had decreased by $189 million (or 3.2%), primarily due to continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and a drop in front store volume, including reduced contributions from expired COVID-19 OTC test kits. Despite a 6.8% increase in pharmacy same-store prescription volume driven by vaccinations and branded GLP-1 drugs, these gains were partially offset by reimbursement challenges and generic drug pricing. Additionally, $747 million in restructuring charges from store closures further strained profitability. This shows a clear evolution from a relatively stable Pharmacy Services segment in 2022 to a more pressured and strategically restructured business by 2024, directly impacting adjusted operating income.",

          "chunk_text": "- front store volume, including the impact of a decrease in store count and lower contributions from COVID-19 over-the-counter ('OTC') test kits since the expiration of the public health emergency in May 2023.\n- Pharmacy same store sales increased 12.3% in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by the 6.8% increase in pharmacy same store prescription volume on a 30-day equivalent basis, including increased contributions from vaccinations, and pharmacy drug mix, including branded GLP-1 drugs. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions.\n- Front store same store sales decreased 2.1% in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to general softening of consumer demand and lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits compared to the prior year.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment include payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs associated with the segment's stores and pharmacy fulfillment operations; selling expenses; advertising expenses; depreciation and amortization expense and certain administrative expenses.\n- Operating expenses remained relatively consistent in 2024 compared to the prior year at $19.6 billion, as the absence of gains from anti-trust legal settlements and increased investments in the segment's operations and capabilities were substantially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Restructuring charges\n\n- During 2024, the Company recorded $747 million of restructuring charges related to the write-down of lease right-of-use assets and property and equipment in connection with the Company's restructuring program. See Note 3 ''Restructuring'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Loss on assets held for sale\n\n- During 2023, the Company recorded losses on assets held for sale of $349 million related to the write-down of its LTC business. See Note 2 ''Acquisitions, Divestitures and Asset Sales'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income decreased $189 million, or 3.2%, in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and decreased front store volume, including lower contributions from COVID-19 OTC test kits, largely offset by increased prescription volume, including increased contributions from vaccinations, as well as improved drug purchasing.\n- As you review the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The segment's adjusted operating income has been adversely affected by the efforts of managed care organizations, PBMs and governmental and other third-party payors to reduce their prescription drug costs, including the use of restrictive networks, as well as changes in the mix  of business within the pharmacy portion of the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment. If the pharmacy reimbursement pressure accelerates, the segment may not be able to grow revenues, and its adjusted operating income could be adversely affected.\n\n## Prescriptions filled\n\n- Prescriptions filled represents the number of prescriptions dispensed through the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's retail and long-term care pharmacies and infusion services operations. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual prescriptions dispensed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-over-period results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of prescription volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- Prescriptions filled increased 4.0% on a 30-day equivalent basis in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily driven by increased utilization, partially offset by the decrease in store count.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy &amp; Consumer Wellness segment's generic drug prescriptions filled by its total prescriptions filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MDT used a rate of compensation increase of 4.29% for U.S. Pension Benefits. By 2024, this assumption had decreased to 3.90%. The change reflects a downward adjustment in expected future wage growth, which would reduce projected benefit obligations over time. This shift in assumption aligns with broader changes in discount rate assumptions, suggesting MDT revised its long-term liability projections downward compared to earlier estimates.",

      "question": "How did UnitedHealth Group's declining consolidated operating margin from 8.3% in 2022 interact with the company's increased reliance on Optum Rx for revenue growth by 2024, given Optum Rx's historically lower operating margin of 4.5% in 2022?",
      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's consolidated operating margin declined from 8.3% in 2022 to a downward trajectory by 2024. This decline was influenced by the company's increased reliance on Optum Rx for revenue growth, which had a lower operating margin of 4.5% in 2022 compared to other segments like Optum Insight (27.9%) and Optum Health (8.3%). Despite Optum Rx's revenue growing from $91.3B in 2022 to being a primary growth driver by 2024, its relatively lower margin profile likely contributed to the overall downward pressure on the consolidated operating margin, creating a complex financial dynamic where revenue growth in lower-margin segments offset margin stability in higher-margin areas.",

        "Hop 1: UNH(2022) \u2192 Operating margin: Consolidated operating margin was 8.3% in 2022 with a decline of 0.4% from 2021",
        "Hop 2: Operating margin \u2192 Optum Rx: Optum Rx had an operating margin of 4.5% in 2022, significantly lower than other segments",

The MCR increased as a result of the revenue effects of the Medicare funding reductions, Medicaid timing mismatch between people's health status and rates, upshift in hospital coding intensity, specialty pharmaceutical prescribing patterns, member mix and due to incremental medical costs for accommodations made to care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Optum Rx contributed $4,436 million to UNH's earnings from operations, which increased to $5,836 million by 2024 \u2014 a $1,400 million (32%) rise. This growth paralleled Optum Rx's revenue increase from $99,773 million in 2022 to $133,231 million in 2024, representing a $33,458 million (34%) growth. The 2024 results explicitly cite Optum Rx as a key driver of consolidated revenue growth, indicating that its rising operational earnings were a critical factor in sustaining its revenue expansion. This demonstrates a clear temporal evolution where Optum Rx's financial performance became increasingly central to UNH's overall growth trajectory.",

The MCR increased as a result of the revenue effects of the Medicare funding reductions, Medicaid timing mismatch between people's health status and rates, upshift in hospital coding intensity, specialty pharmaceutical prescribing patterns, member mix and due to incremental medical costs for accommodations made to care providers as a result of the Change Healthcare cyberattack.",

      "answer": "In 2022, TMO's Life Sciences Solutions segment reported $13,532 million in revenue and accounted for $197 million of the company's total $831 million consolidated depreciation expense, or about 23.7%. This indicates the segment had significant capital investments that year. However, by 2023, Life Sciences Solutions revenue dropped to $9,977 million\u2014a decrease of $3,555 million or 26.3%. The decline suggests that despite substantial capital investments (as reflected in its depreciation allocation), the segment experienced either reduced demand for its offerings, operational challenges, or strategic shifts that negatively impacted revenue generation. This divergence between capital investment and revenue performance raises questions about the return on those investments and whether market conditions or internal execution issues affected the segment's performance.",

      "answer": "In 2023, JNJ initiated a restructuring of its MedTech segment, including exiting certain markets and product lines, with a pre-tax restructuring expense of $319 million. Despite these actions, the MedTech segment reported U.S. sales of $15.3 billion in 2023, reflecting 14.2% growth compared to 2022. In 2024, U.S. sales for the broader pharmaceutical and MedTech portfolios continued to grow, with several key franchises like DARZALEX and Pulmonary Hypertension showing double-digit year-over-year increases (24.8% and 16.5%, respectively). However, some legacy products such as IMBRUVICA and ZYTIGA saw declines. Overall, the restructuring did not hinder U.S. sales momentum, as the company maintained strong performance in newer therapies and continued to grow in key therapeutic areas.",

      "answer": "DHR's operating profit margins declined significantly from 28.3% in 2022 to 21.8% in 2023, a drop of 650 basis points. This deterioration was primarily driven by lower core sales in 2023, which unfavorably impacted margins by 575 basis points. The core sales decline was attributed to reduced demand for molecular diagnostics tests, particularly for COVID-19, which led to a 11.5% decrease in total segment sales. This drop in sales volume reduced leverage in DHR's operational and administrative cost structure, compounding the margin pressure. Thus, the relationship between operating profit margins and lower core sales reveals a clear financial cascade from 2022 performance to 2023 outcomes.",

By 2024, UnitedHealthcare's operating margin dropped to 5.2%, a 0.6 percentage point decrease. Despite this decline in the largest segment, the consolidated operating margin remained stable at 8.1%, indicating that other segments, particularly Optum Health (which increased its margin from 6.9% to 7.4%) and Optum Rx (which maintained a stable 4.4% margin), offset the deterioration in UnitedHealthcare's performance.

      "answer": "In 2022, the Pharmacy Services segment reported $11.6 billion in retail co-payments as part of its total revenues, indicating that co-payments were recognized at the point of prescription fulfillment, even when dispensed through the retail network. This approach created intersegment revenue overlap, as both the Pharmacy Services and Retail/LTC segments recorded adjusted operating income when PSS members used retail pharmacies for maintenance prescriptions. By 2023, the Retail/LTC segment's disaggregated revenue table no longer reflected this dual recognition, suggesting a shift in revenue attribution policy. This change indicates a more consolidated or realigned intersegment revenue management strategy, likely aimed at streamlining financial reporting and improving clarity around segment profitability.",

The 2023 unaudited pro forma net earnings from continuing operations were adjusted to exclude the pretax impact of $68 million of nonrecurring acquisition date fair v alue adjustments to inv entory and the settlement of pre-acquisition sharebased payment awards related to the Abcam Acquisition. In addition, acquisition-related transaction costs of $27 million pretax for the year ended December 31, 2023 associated with the Abcam Acquisition were excluded from pro forma net earnings from continuing operations.\n\n## NOTE 3. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS\n\nOn September 30, 2023 (the 'Distribution Date'), the Company completed the separation (the 'Separation') of its former Env ironmental &amp; Applied Solutions business by distributing to Danaher stockholders on a pro rata basis all of the issued and outstanding common stock of Veralto Corporation ('Veralto'), the entity Danaher incorporated to hold such businesses. To effect the Separation, Danaher distributed to its stockholders one share of Veralto common stock for ev ery three shares of Danaher common stock outstanding as of September 13, 2023, the record date for the distribution. Fractional shares of Veralto common stock that otherwise would hav e been distributed were aggregated and sold into the public market and the proceeds distributed to Danaher stockholders who otherwise would hav e receiv ed fractional shares of Veralto common stock.\n\nIn preparation for the Separation, in September 2023 Veralto issued approximately $2.6 billion in debt securities (refer to Note 13). The proceeds from these issuances were used to fund the approximately $2.6 billion net cash distributions Veralto made to Danaher prior to the Distribution Date ('Veralto Distribution'). Danaher used the Veralto Distribution proceeds to redeem approximately $1.0 billion of commercial paper, to satisfy bond maturities and to fund certain of the Company's regular, quarterly cash div idends to shareholders.\n\nThe accounting requirements for reporting Veralto as a discontinued operation were met when the Separation was completed. Accordingly, the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements for all periods presented reflect this business as a discontinued operation. The Company allocated a portion of the consolidated interest expense to discontinued operations based on the ratio of the discontinued business' net assets to the Company's consolidated net assets.\n\nAs a result of the Separation, the Company incurred $145 million and $9 million in Separation-related costs during the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely, which are reflected in earnings from discontinued operations, net of income taxes in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Earnings. These costs primarily relate to professional fees associated with preparation of regulatory filings and activ ities within finance, tax, legal and information technology functions as well as certain inv estment banking fees and tax costs incurred upon the Separation.\n\nIn connection with the Separation, Danaher and Veralto entered into v arious agreements to effect the Separation and prov ide a framework for their relationship after the Separation, including a separation and distribution agreement, transition serv ices agreement, an employee matters agreement, a tax matters agreement, an intellectual property matters agreement and a Danaher Business System ('DBS') license agreement. These agreements prov ide for the allocation between Danaher and Veralto of assets, employees, liabilities and obligations (including inv estments, property, employee benefits and tax-related assets and liabilities) attributable to periods prior to, at and after Veralto's separation from Danaher and gov ern certain relationships between Danaher and Veralto after the Separation. In addition, Danaher is also party to v arious commercial agreements with Veralto entities. The amounts paid and receiv ed by Danaher for transition serv ices prov ided under the abov e agreements as well as sales and purchases to and from Veralto were not material to the Company's results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\nThe key components of income from the Veralto business from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31 were as follows ($ in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How did the 8.6% increase in operating expenses in the Health Services segment in 2024 relate to the growth in specialty pharmacy revenues, and what role did CVS Caremark's operational focus on Specialty Pharmacy play in this financial evolution?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CVS Caremark maintained an operational focus on Specialty Pharmacy, as evidenced by leadership continuity in that segment. By 2024, this focus aligned with the company's reported growth in specialty pharmacy revenues, which helped offset the $13.2 billion total revenue decline. The 8.6% increase in operating expenses within the Health Services segment was primarily attributed to costs associated with the 2023 acquisition of Oak Street Health, which expanded the company's healthcare delivery capabilities, including those that likely support specialty pharmacy services. Thus, the operational emphasis on Specialty Pharmacy through CVS Caremark in 2023 appears to have laid the foundation for strategic investments in 2024 that directly influenced both revenue composition and expense structure.",

The decrease was primarily driven by the previously announced loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. These decreases were partially offset by pharmacy drug mix, increased contributions from the Company's health care delivery assets, including the 2023 acquisitions of Oak Street Health and Signify Health, as well as growth in specialty pharmacy.\n\n## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Health Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; and depreciation and amortization expense.\n- Operating expenses increased $255 million, or 8.6%, in 2024 compared to 2023. The increase was primarily driven by operating expenses associated with Oak Street Health which was acquired in May of 2023, including the amortization of acquired intangible assets.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MRK's Animal Health segment generated $5.625 billion in segment sales, which increased to $5.877 billion in 2024, representing a 4.5% growth. According to the 2024 10-K filing, Animal Health segment profits increased by 12% in 2024, primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturing-related costs, despite increased administrative costs and unfavorable foreign exchange effects. The cost of sales for the Animal Health segment decreased from $2.498 billion in 2023 to $2.469 billion in 2024, while SG&A expenses rose slightly from $1.038 billion to $1.084 billion. This indicates that the segment was able to leverage its sales growth to outpace cost increases, resulting in improved profitability.",

Animal Health segment profits are comprised of segment sales, less all cost of sales, as well as SG&amp;A  and R&amp;D expenses directly incurred by the segment. For internal management reporting presented to the chief operating decision maker, M erck does not allocate the remaining cost of sales not included in segment profits as described above, R&amp;D expenses incurred by M RL, or general and administrative expenses not directly incurred by the segments, nor the cost of financing these activities. Separate divisions maintain responsibility for monitoring and managing these costs, including depreciation related to fixed assets utiliz ed by  these div isions and, therefore, they  are not included in segment profits. A lso excluded from the determination of segment profits are costs related to restructuring activities and acquisition- and divestiture-related costs, including the amortization of intangible assets and amortization of purchase accounting adjustments,  intangible  asset  impairment  charges,  and  expense  or  income  related  to  changes  in  the  estimated  fair  value  measurement  of  liabilities  for contingent consideration. A dditionally , segment profits do not reflect other expenses from corporate and manufacturing cost centers and other miscellaneous income or expense. These unallocated items are reflected in 'Non-segment activity' in the above table. A lso included in 'Non-segment activity' are miscellaneous corporate profits (losses), as well as operating profits (losses) related to third-party manufacturing arrangements.\n\nPharmaceutical segment profits grew 15% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales, partially offset by higher administrative and promotional costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange. A nimal Health segment profits increased 12% in 2024 primarily due to higher sales and lower manufacturingrelated costs, partially  offset by  increased administrativ e costs, as well as the unfavorable effect of foreign exchange.\n\n## Taxes on Income\n\nThe effective income tax rate of 14.1% in 2024 reflects a favorable mix of income and expense, as well as a 2.6 percentage point favorable impact due to a $519 million reduction in reserves for unrecognized income tax benefits resulting from the expiration in 2024 of the statute of limitations for assessments related to the 2019 and 2020 federal tax return years. The effective income tax rate in 2024 also reflects a 1.5 percentage point combined unfavorable impact of charges for the acquisition of Harpoon, for which no tax benefit was recognized, and the acquisitions of EyeBio and M K-1045 for which minimal tax benefits were realized.\n\nWhile many jurisdictions in which M erck operates have adopted the global minimum tax provision of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Pillar 2, effective for tax years beginning in January 2024, it resulted in a minimal impact to the Company's 2024 effective income tax rate due to the accounting",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Health Care Benefits segment contributed $6.188B to adjusted operating income, reflecting its strong performance and profitability. By 2023, the segment's total balance grew to $46.644B, up from $44.159B in 2022, with $2.594B of that increase attributed to acquisitions. This indicates that CVS strategically prioritized external growth in the Health Care Benefits segment, leveraging acquisitions to expand its footprint and capabilities in health care benefits management. The segment realignment of $109M also suggests internal restructuring to optimize operations, aligning with the broader growth strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "question": "How did the change in CVS's Medicare Advantage star ratings from 2022 (based on 2021 membership) to 2025 (based on 2024 membership) impact the company's eligibility for CMS bonus payments under the ACA framework, and what does this imply for their 2026 bonus payment outlook?",
      "answer": "In 2022, based on 2021 membership, 87% of CVS's Medicare Advantage members were in plans with star ratings of at least 4.0, making them eligible for CMS bonus payments under the ACA. By 2025, based on 2024 membership, this figure slightly declined to 88% of members in 4.0+ rated plans. While the percentage of eligible members remained high, the slight decrease suggests a marginal decline in plan quality or performance. This trajectory implies that while CVS remains well-positioned for CMS bonus payments, the small drop in high-rated membership could result in a slightly lower bonus payment in 2026 compared to prior years, assuming CMS payment formulas remain unchanged.",

Future operating results could be adversely affected if the premium rates requested are not approved or are adjusted downward or their approval is delayed by state or federal regulators.\n\nThe Company has Medicare Advantage and PDP contracts with CMS to provide HMO, PPO and prescription drug coverage to Medicare beneficiaries in certain geographic areas. Under these annual contracts, CMS pays the Company a fixed per member (or 'capitation') payment and/or a portion of the premium, both of which are based on membership and adjusted for demographic and health risk factors. CMS also considers inflation, changes in utilization patterns and average per capita fee-for-service Medicare costs in the calculation of the fixed capitation payment or premium. PDP contracts also provide a risk-sharing arrangement with CMS to limit the Company's exposure to unfavorable expenses or benefit from favorable expenses. Amounts payable to the Company under the Medicare arrangements are subject to annual revision by CMS, and the Company elects to participate in each Medicare service area or region on an annual basis. Premiums paid to the Company for Medicare products are subject to federal government reviews and audits, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive and prospective premium adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members. In addition to payments received from CMS, some Medicare Advantage products and all PDP products require a supplemental premium to be paid by the member or sponsoring employer. In some cases these supplemental premiums are adjusted based on the member's income and asset levels. Compared to Commercial Medical products, Medicare contracts generate higher per member per month revenues and higher health care and other benefit costs.\n\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the 'ACA') ties a portion of each Medicare Advantage plan's reimbursement to the plan's 'star ratings.' Plans must have a star rating of four or higher (out of five) to qualify for bonus payments. CMS released the Company's 2022 star ratings in October 2021. The Company's 2022 star ratings will be used to determine which of the Company's Medicare Advantage plans have ratings of four stars or higher and qualify for bonus payments in 2023. Based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2021, 87% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members were in plans with 2022 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars, compared to 83% of the Company's Medicare Advantage members being in plans with 2021 star ratings of at least 4.0 stars based on the Company's membership at December 31, 2020.\n\nRates for Medicare Supplement products are regulated at the state level and vary by state and plan.\n\nUnder Insured Medicaid contracts, state government agencies pay the Company fixed monthly rates per member that vary by state, line of business and demographics; and the Company arranges, pays for and manages the health care services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. These rates are subject to change by each state, and, in some instances, provide for adjustment for health risk factors. CMS requires these rates to be actuarially sound. The Company also receives fees from customers where it provides services under ASC Medicaid contracts. ASC Medicaid contracts generally are for periods of more than one year, and certain of them contain performance incentives and limited financial risk sharing with respect to certain medical, financial and operational metrics. Under these arrangements, performance is evaluated annually, with associated financial incentive opportunities, and financial risk share obligations are typically limited to a percentage of the fees otherwise payable to the Company. Payments to the Company under Medicaid contracts are subject to the annual appropriation process in the applicable state.\n\nUnder Duals contracts, the rate setting process is generally established by CMS in partnership with the state government agency participating in the demonstration project. Both CMS and the state government agency may seek premium and other refunds under certain circumstances, including if the Company fails to comply with CMS regulations or other contractual requirements.\n\nThe Company offers HMO and consumer-directed medical and dental plans to federal employees under the Federal Employees Health Benefits ('FEHB') Program and the Federal Employees Dental and Vision Insurance Program. Premium rates and fees for those plans are subject to federal government review and audit, which can result, and have resulted, in retroactive and prospective premium and fee adjustments and refunds to the government and/or members.\n\nBeginning in 2014, the ACA imposed significant new industry-wide fees, assessments and taxes, including an annual levy known as the health insurer fee (the 'HIF'). The HIF applied for 2020 and was temporarily suspended for 2019. In December 2019, the HIF was repealed for calendar years after 2020. For additional information on the ACA fees, assessments and taxes, see Note 1 ''Significant Accounting Policies'' included in Item 8 of this 10-K. The Company's goal is to collect premiums and fees where possible, or solve for, all of the ACA-related fees, assessments and taxes.",

      "question": "How did the increase in Abbott's Additions to Property and Equipment for the Nutritionals segment from $174 million in 2022 to $382 million in 2024 reflect the company's evolving capital investment strategy in its core business segments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Abbott's Nutritionals segment reported $174 million in Additions to Property and Equipment, which increased significantly to $382 million by 2024. This nearly doubling of capital investment in the Nutritionals segment indicates a strategic shift toward expanding or upgrading infrastructure and capabilities in this business area. The increase suggests Abbott prioritized scaling its nutrition business, potentially to meet growing demand, enhance production efficiency, or support new product development. This evolution in capital allocation aligns with the broader trend of increased investment across reportable segments, as seen in the total Additions to Property and Equipment rising from $1,671 million in 2022 to $1,953 million in 2024.",

      "answer": "JNJ's amortization of prior service cost for retirement plans remained unchanged at $184 million in both 2022 and 2024, suggesting a consistent accounting approach over the period. However, the projected future benefit payments for retirement plans increased from $1,317 million in 2022 to $1,421 million in 2024, indicating growing long-term pension obligations. This implies that while the amortization method remained stable, the underlying pension liabilities were increasing, requiring higher future benefit payments.",

      "answer": "The increase in TMO's Laboratory Products and Biopharma Services segment revenue from $14,862 million in 2022 to $23,041 million in 2023 was accompanied by a rise in Segment Income from $1,844 million to $3,358 million, indicating a significant improvement in profitability. This reflects a positive trajectory where the business unit not only expanded its top-line revenue but also enhanced its operating efficiency or pricing power, leading to a disproportionately higher growth in income compared to revenue (33% revenue growth vs 82% income growth).",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS's Adjusted Operating Income increased by $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, primarily driven by improved purchasing economics and contributions from the group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy. However, during the same year, the Corporate & Other segment reported a loss of $1.471 billion, up from $1.306 billion in 2020, indicating that the corporate overhead and unallocated expenses were growing even as core operating segments improved. In 2023, CVS restructured into four segments, including the newly formed Health Services and Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segments, which suggests a strategic shift to better align corporate costs with operational units. This restructuring likely aimed to address the growing losses in Corporate & Other by redistributing costs and responsibilities to the newly defined segments, potentially improving financial transparency and accountability for the drivers of Adjusted Operating Income.",

          "chunk_text": "## Operating expenses\n\n- Operating expenses in the Pharmacy Services segment include selling, general and administrative expenses; depreciation and amortization expense; and expenses related to specialty retail pharmacies, which include store and administrative payroll, employee benefits and occupancy costs.\n- Operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues remained consistent at 1.0% in both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Adjusted operating income\n\n- Adjusted operating income increased $1.2 billion, or 20.6%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income was primarily driven by improved purchasing economics which reflected increased contributions from the products and services of the Company's group purchasing organization and specialty pharmacy (including pharmacy and/or administrative services for providers and Covered Entities). These increases were partially offset by continued price compression.\n- As you review the Pharmacy Services segment's performance in this area, you should consider the following important information about the business:\n- The Company's efforts to (i) retain existing clients, (ii) obtain new business and (iii) maintain or improve the rebates, fees and/or discounts the Company receives from manufacturers, wholesalers and retail pharmacies continue to have an impact on adjusted operating income. In particular, competitive pressures in the PBM industry have caused the Company and other PBMs to continue to share with clients a larger portion of rebates, fees and/or discounts received from pharmaceutical manufacturers. In addition, marketplace dynamics and regulatory changes have limited the Company's ability to offer plan sponsors pricing that includes retail network 'differential' or 'spread,' and the Company expects these trends to continue. The 'differential' or 'spread' is any difference between the drug price charged to plan sponsors, including Medicare Part D plan sponsors, by a PBM and the price paid for the drug by the PBM to the dispensing provider.\n\n## Pharmacy claims processed\n\n- Total pharmacy claims processed represents the number of prescription claims processed through our pharmacy benefits manager and dispensed by either our retail network pharmacies or our own mail and specialty pharmacies. Management uses this metric to understand variances between actual claims processed and expected amounts as well as trends in period-overperiod results. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding the impact of pharmacy claim volume on segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Company's pharmacy network claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 6.9% to 1.9 billion claims in 2021 compared to 1.8 billion claims in 2020. The increase in pharmacy network claims processed was primarily driven by net new business and COVID-19 vaccinations, as well as increased new therapy prescriptions, which were adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic during 2020.\n- The Company's mail choice claims processed on a 30-day equivalent basis increased 2.4% to 330.7 million claims in 2021 compared to 322.8 million claims in 2020. The increase in mail choice claims was primarily driven by net new business and the continued adoption of Maintenance Choice offerings.\n- Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, total pharmacy claims processed increased 4.2%, on a 30-day equivalent basis, in 2021 compared to the prior year.\n\n## Generic dispensing rate\n\n- Generic dispensing rate is calculated by dividing the Pharmacy Services segment's generic drug prescriptions processed or filled by its total prescriptions processed or filled. Management uses this metric to evaluate the effectiveness of the business at encouraging the use of generic drugs when they are available and clinically appropriate, which aids in decreasing costs for client members and retail customers. This metric provides management and investors with information useful in understanding trends in segment total revenues and operating results.\n- The Pharmacy Services segment's total generic dispensing rate decreased to 86.8% in 2021 compared to 88.2% in the prior year. The decrease in the segment's generic dispensing rate was primarily driven by an increase in brand prescriptions, largely attributable to COVID-19 vaccinations in 2021. Excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccinations, the segment's total generic dispensing rate increased to 88.5% in 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CVS explicitly excluded LTC operations from same-store sales and prescription volume metrics used to evaluate performance of existing stores, as noted in the 2022 10-K filing. By 2023, LTC operations were fully integrated into the Pharmacy & Consumer Wellness segment, which now included over 9,000 retail locations with LTC pharmacies as part of its operational footprint. This integration means that 2023 performance metrics likely reflect contributions from LTC operations that were absent in 2022 comparisons, making year-over-year growth appear potentially understated for 2022 or enhanced in 2023, though exact quantitative impact cannot be determined from the provided chunks.",

This adjustment reflects the fact that these prescriptions include approximately three times the amount of product days supplied compared to a normal prescription.\n\n(3) Same store sales and prescription volume represent the change in revenues and prescriptions filled in the Company's retail pharmacy stores that have been operating for greater than one year, expressed as a percentage that indicates the increase or decrease relative to the comparable prior period. Same store metrics exclude revenues from MinuteClinic, revenues and prescriptions from LTC operations and, in 2019, revenues and prescriptions from stores in Brazil. Management uses these metrics to evaluate the performance of existing stores on a comparable basis and to inform future decisions regarding existing stores and new locations. Same-store metrics provide management and investors with information useful in understanding the portion of current revenues and prescriptions resulting from organic growth in existing locations versus the portion resulting from opening new stores.\n\n## Commentary - 2021 compared to 2020\n\n## Revenues\n\n- Total revenues increased $8.9 billion, or 9.8%, to $100.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily driven by increased prescription and front store volume, the administration of COVID-19 vaccinations and diagnostic testing, as well as brand inflation. These increases were partially offset by continued pharmacy reimbursement pressure and the impact of recent generic introductions. COVID-19 vaccinations, diagnostic testing and OTC test kit sales contributed approximately 45% of the increase in the segment's revenues in 2021 compared to the prior year. The prior year reflected",

      "answer": "In 2023, Abbott disclosed that the Diagnostics segment had incurred $441 million in restructuring charges related to aligning its manufacturing network for COVID-19 diagnostic tests. These charges were recorded in the Cost of products sold. In 2024, the company disclosed that depreciation and amortization (D&A) expenses for the Diagnostics segment had decreased to $577 million in 2023 from $590 million in 2022, continuing a downward trend from $614 million in 2021. This indicates that the restructuring had a lasting impact on asset valuation, as the reduced D&A suggests a lower book value of assets following the restructuring actions taken in 2021 and carried forward into 2023. The 2024 disclosures further reinforce the company\u2019s approach to valuing intangible assets using a discounted cash flow model, which would have been influenced by the restructuring outcomes and reduced asset base.",

Assets and liabilities that are measured using significant other observable inputs are valued by reference to similar assets or liabilities, adjusted for contract restrictions and other terms specific to that asset or liability. For these items, a significant portion of fair value is derived by reference to quoted prices of similar assets or liabilities in active markets. For all remaining assets and liabilities, fair value is derived using a fair value model, such as a discounted cash flow model or Black-Scholes model. Purchased intangible assets are recorded at fair value. The fair value of significant purchased intangible assets is based on independent appraisals. Abbott uses a discounted cash flow model to value intangible assets. The discounted cash flow model requires assumptions about the timing and amount of future net cash flows, risk, the cost of capital, terminal values and market participants. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on a quarterly basis. G oodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually.\n\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION - The fair value of stock options and restricted stock awards and units are amortized over their requisite service period, which could be shorter than the vesting period if an employee is retirement eligible, with a charge to compensation expense.\n\nLITIGATION - Abbott accounts for litigation losses in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) No. 450, 'Contingencies.' Under ASC No. 450, loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management's best estimate of a loss, or when a best estimate cannot be made, a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded. Legal fees are recorded as incurred.\n\nCASH, CASH EQUIV ALENTS AND INVESTMENTS - Cash equivalents consist of bank time deposits, U.S. government securities, money market funds and U.S. treasury bills with original maturities of three months or less. Abbott holds certain investments with a carrying value of $139 million that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Investments held in a rabbi trust and investments in publicly traded equity securities are recorded at fair value and changes in fair value are recorded in earnings. Investments in equity securities that are not traded on public stock exchanges are recorded at cost minus impairment, if any, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer.\n\nTRADE RECEIV ABLE V ALUATIONS - Accounts receivable are stated at the net amount expected to be collected. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects  the  current  estimate  of  credit  losses  ex pected  to  be  incurred  over  the  life  of  the  accounts  receivable. Abbott  considers  various  factors  in  establishing, monitoring, and adjusting its allowance for doubtful accounts, including the aging of the accounts and aging trends, the historical level of charge-offs, and specific exposures related to particular customers. Abbott also monitors other risk factors and forward-looking information, such as country risk, when determining credit limits  for  customers and establishing adequate allowances. Accounts receivable are charged off after all reasonable means to collect the full amount (including litigation, where appropriate) have been exhausted.\n\nINVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. Cost includes material and conversion costs.\n\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT - Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following table shows estimated useful lives of property and equipment:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Johnson & Johnson reported $331 million in additions to Property, Plant & Equipment for the Consumer Health segment in 2021. By 2024, the company had completed the separation of the Consumer Health business in Q3 2023, leading to a restructured reporting framework consisting only of Innovative Medicine and MedTech segments. This evolution indicates a strategic shift away from Consumer Health, despite prior capital investments, to focus on higher-growth, innovation-driven areas.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Amgen reported that ENBREL sales were negatively impacted by a lower net selling price, along with lower inventory and unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions. This downward trend in net selling price continued into 2024, where it was the sole driver of the decline in ENBREL sales. Looking ahead, Amgen expects continued declines in net selling price, including the impact of the IRA Medicare Part D price set by CMS for 2026, which is projected to further pressure ENBREL sales despite stable volume expectations. This shows a clear causal chain where declining pricing power in 2023 flowed through to reduced sales performance in 2024 and is expected to persist into future years.",

SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nThe Company operates and reports its results in three separate business segments consisting of the Biotechnology, Life Sciences and Diagnostics segments. Operating profit represents total rev enues less operating expenses, excluding nonoperating income and expense, interest and income taxes. The identifiable assets by segment are those used in each segment's operations. Intersegment amounts are not significant and are eliminated to arriv e at consolidated totals.\n\nThe Company's President and Chief Executiv e Officer is the chief operating decision maker ('CODM'). The CODM uses segment sales and operating profit to allocate resources (including employees and financial or capital resources), to assess the performance of the segments and in the determination of the compensation for certain employees for each segment predominantly in the annual budget process. The CODM rev iews forecast-to-actual variances in segment sales and operating profit on a monthly basis when making decisions about allocating capital and personnel to the segments.\n\nThe table below reconciles segment sales to segment operating profit with the expense categories presented reflecting the expenses that the Company has determined to be significant segment expenses. Significant segment expenses are the expense category details regularly prov ided to the CODM to allocate resources to the segments and to ev aluate segment performance. Detailed segment data for the years ended December 31 is as follows ($ in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "The amortization of prior service cost for JNJ's retirement plans remained unchanged at $184 million in both 2023 and 2024. This stability suggests that the financial obligation tied to the 2021 pension formula amendment, which will standardize benefit calculations under the Retirement Value formula starting in 2026, has not yet shown a measurable shift in amortization costs despite the upcoming structural change. The lack of change in amortization indicates that the prior service cost is being systematically recognized over time, independent of the impending formula transition.",

      "answer": "In 2021, PFE's income from continuing operations before taxes increased by $17.3 billion compared to 2020, with higher net gains on equity securities being one of the contributing factors. However, by 2023, the company experienced a dramatic $33.7 billion decrease in this metric compared to 2022. While net gains on equity securities did return to positive in 2023 (versus net losses in 2022), they were not sufficient to offset the broader decline driven by lower revenues, higher intangible asset impairment charges, and increased restructuring and administrative expenses. This reflects a significant shift in the company's financial performance dynamics, where the positive impact of equity securities gains was overwhelmed by operational headwinds in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Income from Continuing Operations Before Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income\n\nThe increase in Income from continuing operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income of $17.3 billion in 2021, compared to 2020, was primarily attributable to: (i) higher revenues, (ii) net periodic benefit credits in 2021 versus net periodic benefit costs in 2020, (iii) lower asset impairment charges, and (iv) higher net gains on equity securities, partially offset by (v) increases in: Cost of sales, Research and development expenses and Selling, informational and administrative expenses.\n\nSee the Analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Income within MD&amp;A and Note 4 for additional information.\n\nFor information on our tax provision and effective tax rate, see the Provision/(Benefit) for Taxes on Income section within MD&amp;A and Note 5 .\n\n## Our Operating Environment\n\nWe, like other businesses in our industry, are subject to certain industry-specific challenges. These include, among others, the topics listed below. See also the Item 1. Business--Government Regulation and Price Constraints and Item 1A. Risk Factors sections of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Regulatory Environment--Pipeline Productivity\n\nOur product lines must be replenished to offset revenue losses when products lose exclusivity or market share or to respond to healthcare and innovation trends, as well as to provide for earnings growth. As a result, we devote considerable resources to our R&amp;D activities which, while essential to our growth, incorporate a high degree of risk and cost, including whether a particular product candidate or new indication for an in-line product will achieve the desired clinical endpoint or safety profile, will be approved by regulators or will be successful commercially. We conduct clinical trials to provide data on safety and efficacy to support the evaluation of a product's overall benefit-risk profile for a particular patient population. In addition, after a product has been approved or authorized and launched, we continue to monitor its safety as long as it is available to patients. This includes postmarketing trials that may be conducted voluntarily or pursuant to a regulatory request to gain additional medical knowledge. For the entire life of the product, we collect safety data and report safety information to the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities may evaluate potential safety concerns and take regulatory actions in response, such as updating a product's labeling, restricting its use, communicating new safety information to the public, or, in rare cases, requiring us to suspend or remove a product from the market. The commercial potential of in-line products may be negatively impacted by post-marketing developments.\n\n## Intellectual Property Rights and Collaboration/Licensing Rights\n\nThe loss, expiration or invalidation of intellectual property rights, patent litigation settlements with manufacturers and the expiration of co-promotion and licensing rights can have a material adverse effect on our revenues. Certain of our products have experienced patent-based expirations or loss of regulatory exclusivity in certain markets in the last few years, and we expect certain products to face increased generic competition over the next few years. While additional patent expiries will continue, we expect a moderate impact of reduced revenues due to patent expiries from 2022 through 2025. We continue to vigorously defend our patent rights against infringement, and we will continue to support efforts that strengthen worldwide recognition of patent rights while taking necessary steps to help ensure appropriate patient access.\n\nFor additional information on patent rights we consider most significant to our business as a whole, see the Item 1. Business--Patents and Other Intellectual Property Rights section in this Form 10-K. For a discussion of recent developments with respect to patent litigation, see Note 16A1.\n\n## Regulatory Environment/Pricing and Access--Government and Other Payer Group Pressures\n\nThe pricing of medicines by pharmaceutical manufacturers and the cost of healthcare, which includes medicines, medical services and hospital services, continues to be important to payers, governments, patients, and other stakeholders. Federal and state governments and private third-party payers in the U.S. continue to take action to manage the utilization of drugs and cost of drugs, including increasingly employing formularies to control costs by taking into account discounts in connection with decisions about formulary inclusion or favorable formulary placement. We consider a number of factors impacting the pricing of our medicines and vaccines. Within the U.S., we often engage with patients, doctors and healthcare plans. We also often provide significant discounts from the list price to insurers, including PBMs and MCOs. The price that patients pay in the U.S. for prescribed medicines and vaccines is ultimately set by healthcare providers and insurers. Governments globally may use a variety of measures to control costs, including proposing pricing reform or legislation, cross country collaboration and procurement, price cuts, mandatory rebates, health technology assessments, forced localization as a condition of market access, 'international reference pricing' (i.e., the practice of a country linking its regulated medicine prices to those of other countries), QCE processes and VBP. In the U.S., we expect to see continued focus by Congress and the Biden Administration on regulating pricing which could result in legislative and regulatory changes designed to control costs. For example, there is proposed legislation that, if enacted, would allow Medicare to negotiate prices for certain prescription drugs, as well as require that penalties be paid by manufacturers who raise drug prices faster than inflation. Also, certain changes proposed by the CMS in December 2020 to the Medicaid program and 340B drug pricing program, which imposes ceilings on prices that drug manufacturers can charge for medications sold to certain health care facilities, could increase our Medicaid rebate obligations and increase the discounts we extend to 340B covered entities if they go into effect. Additional changes to the 340B program are undergoing review and their status is unclear. We anticipate that these and similar initiatives will continue to increase pricing pressures globally. For additional information, see the Item 1. Business --Pricing Pressures and Managed Care Organizations and -Government Regulation and Price Constraints sections in this Form 10-K.\n\n## Product Supply\n\nWe periodically encounter supply delays, disruptions or shortages, including due to voluntary product recalls such as our recent Chantix recall. For information on our recent Chantix recall and risks related to product manufacturing, see the Item 1A. Risk Factors--Product Manufacturing, Sales and Marketing Risks section in this Form 10-K.\n\n## The Global Economic Environment\n\nIn addition to the industry-specific factors discussed above, we, like other businesses of our size and global extent of activities, are exposed to economic cycles. Certain factors in the global economic environment that may impact our global operations include, among other things, currency fluctuations, capital and exchange controls, global economic conditions including inflation, restrictive government actions, changes in intellectual property, legal protections and remedies, trade regulations, tax laws and regulations and procedures and actions affecting approval,\n\nPfizer Inc.\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n28",

      "answer": "The analysis reveals a misalignment between capital investments and segment performance in Specialty Diagnostics. In 2022, TMO reported consolidated depreciation of $831 million, which includes $128 million specifically allocated to the Specialty Diagnostics segment. This indicates significant capital investment in the segment's infrastructure or equipment. However, from 2022 to 2023, despite these investments, the segment experienced a revenue decline of 7.6%\u2014falling from $4,763 million in 2022 to $4,405 million in 2023. This suggests that the capital investments reflected in depreciation did not yield proportional revenue growth or stability in the Specialty Diagnostics segment, raising concerns about the effectiveness of capital allocation or external factors affecting the segment's performance.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Optum reported an operating margin of 7.7%, which was slightly below the consolidated operating margin of UnitedHealth at 8.3%. Despite this, Optum's strong revenue growth of $19,257 million year-over-year and consistent margin performance across its segments\u2014especially Optum Insight, which saw a 2.7 percentage point increase\u2014laid a foundation for improved profitability. By 2023, UnitedHealth reported a consolidated operating margin of 8.7%, indicating margin expansion. This suggests that Optum's stable performance and growth likely played a key role in driving the broader company's profitability, possibly through enhanced operational efficiency, strategic cost management, or a more favorable mix of services.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UNH(2022) \u2192 Optum: UNH reported Optum's operating margin at 7.7% in 2022, with $155,565 million in revenue and $11,995 million in earnings from operations.",
        "Hop 2: Optum \u2192 Operating margin: Optum's operating margin increased from 7.4% in 2020 to 7.7% in 2022, driven by strong performance in Optum Insight and Optum Health.",
        "Hop 3: Operating margin \u2190 UNH(2023): UNH's consolidated operating margin rose to 8.7% in 2023, up from 8.3% in 2022, suggesting that Optum's margin trends contributed to this expansion."

      "answer": "In 2022, DHR reported a gross profit margin of 61.0%, up from 56.0% in 2021, indicating strong performance. In 2023, the company incurred $87 million in inventory charges, primarily in the Biotechnology segment, which increased cost of sales and temporarily pressured gross profit margins. By 2024, these 2023 charges had a favorable impact on gross profit margin year-over-year, as they created a lower cost base to compare against, contributing to an improved margin. Additionally, the 2024 gross margin performance was further supported by cost savings and acquisition synergies, despite a $25 million acquisition-related inventory charge in 2024. The inventory charges thus played a pivotal role as a transitional cost that initially depressed margins in 2023 but contributed to a relative improvement in 2024 when compared to that lower baseline.",

      "answer": "UnitedHealth Group's earnings from operations decreased from $32,358 million in 2023 to $32,287 million in 2024, a marginal decline. However, within this context, Optum Health's earnings from operations increased from $6,560 million in 2023 to $7,770 million in 2024. This growth in Optum Health's earnings was driven by gains from business portfolio refinement, increased investment income, and cost management initiatives, despite challenges such as Medicare Advantage funding reductions and costs associated with newly added patients under value-based care arrangements. The earnings growth in Optum Health helped offset declines in other segments, particularly UnitedHealthcare, which experienced reduced earnings due to Medicaid redeterminations and the impacts of the Change Healthcare cyberattack.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UNH(2023) \u2192 Optum Health: UnitedHealth Group reported Optum Health as one of its key segments in 2023, with a focus on care delivery, value-based care, and wellness services.",
        "Hop 2: Optum Health \u2192 Earnings from Operations: In 2024, Optum Health\u2019s earnings from operations increased from $6,560 million to $7,770 million due to strategic initiatives and cost management.",
        "Hop 3: Earnings from Operations \u2190 UNH(2024): Despite Optum Health\u2019s growth, UnitedHealth Group\u2019s overall earnings from operations slightly declined from $32,358 million in 2023 to $32,287 million in 2024, indicating that gains in Optum Health were not enough to fully offset losses elsewhere."
