      "question": "How did BNY Mellon's exposure to credit rating-related financial risks evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of the potential impact of a material reduction in credit ratings on its subsidiaries' funding costs and overall financial condition?",
      "answer": "BNY Mellon consistently highlighted the risk of increased funding and borrowing costs due to potential credit rating downgrades across all three years. In 2022, the bank noted that a downgrade could have a 'material adverse effect' on its business and financial condition. In 2023, it reiterated this risk, emphasizing the impact on 'securities we issue' and naming specific subsidiaries (The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, N.A., and The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV). By 2024, the language remained largely consistent, but the risk was expanded to include a broader set of operational constraints, such as limitations on capital returns to shareholders and increased regulatory scrutiny. This indicates a stable but increasingly nuanced articulation of credit risk exposure over time, with no evidence of mitigation or reduction in the stated risk severity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [BK](2022) \u2192 [Reported Financial Condition]: A downgrade could 'increase the cost of funding and borrowing' and have a 'material adverse effect' on financial condition and securities.",
        "Hop 2: [BK](2023) \u2192 [Reported Financial Condition]: Reiterated the risk of increased costs due to rating reductions, specifically naming subsidiaries and expanding the impact to include reputational and regulatory effects.",
        "Hop 3: [BK](2024) \u2192 [Reported Financial Condition]: Maintained the same risk language but added implications for capital return policies and emphasized broader operational constraints."

      "answer": "BNY Mellon's assets under management in its Investment and Wealth Management segment were $2.4 trillion in 2022, declined slightly to $2.0 trillion in 2023, and remained stable at $2.0 trillion in 2024. This trend suggests a contraction in the segment's AUM during 2023, potentially due to market volatility or client outflows, followed by stabilization in 2024, indicating possible strategic adjustments to retain or reposition offerings in a competitive wealth management landscape.",

BUSINESS\n\n## Description of Business\n\nThe Bank of New York Mellon Corporation, a Delaware corporation (NYSE symbol: BK), is a global company headquartered in New York, New York, with $46.7 trillion in assets under custody and/or administration and $2.4 trillion in assets under management as of Dec. 31, 2021. With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.\n\nWe previously divided our businesses into two business segments, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth Management. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we disaggregated our Investment Services business segment into two new business segments, Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services. Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment was not impacted by this resegmentation. We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments and certain business exits.\n\nFor a further discussion of BNY Mellon's lines of business, products and services, see the 'Overview,' 'Summary of financial highlights,' 'Fee and other revenue,' 'Review of business segments' and 'International operations' sections in the MD&amp;A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference. See the 'Available Information' section on page 1 of this Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference, for a description of how to access financial and other information regarding BNY Mellon.\n\nOur two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries engage in trust and custody activities, investment management services, banking services and various securities-related activities. Our two principal U.S. banking subsidiaries are:\n\n- The Bank of New York Mellon, a New York state-chartered bank, which houses our Securities Services businesses, including Asset Servicing and Issuer Services and certain Market and Wealth Services businesses, including Treasury\n- Services and Clearance and Collateral Management, as well as the bank-advised business of Investment Management; and\n- BNY Mellon, National Association ('BNY Mellon, N.A.'), a national bank, which houses our Wealth Management business and certain activities of our Pershing businesses.\n\nWe have four other U.S. bank and/or trust company subsidiaries concentrating on trust products and services across the United States: The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, National Association, BNY Mellon Trust of Delaware, BNY Mellon Investment Servicing Trust Company and BNY Mellon Trust Company of Illinois. Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.\n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.\n\nBNY Mellon's banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve').  The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV ('BNY Mellon SA/NV') is the main banking subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon in continental Europe. It is authorized and regulated as a credit institution by the European Central Bank and the National Bank of Belgium under the Single Supervisory Mechanism and is also supervised by the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority for conduct of business rules. BNY Mellon SA/NV has its principal office in Brussels and branches in Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Copenhagen, Denmark; Dublin, Ireland; Frankfurt, Germany; the City of Luxembourg, Luxembourg; Madrid, Spain; Milan, Italy; and Paris, France.  BNY Mellon SA/NV's activities are in the Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services segments of BNY Mellon with a focus on global custody, asset servicing and collateral management.

      "answer": "Visa's unrecognized tax benefits that could reduce the effective tax rate were $1.3 billion in fiscal 2022, increased to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2023, and then decreased slightly to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2024. This pattern indicates that the company's tax position faced increasing uncertainty or strategic reassessment in fiscal 2023, followed by some resolution or stabilization in fiscal 2024. Despite the slight decline in the final year, the overall level of unrecognized benefits remained elevated compared to the starting point, suggesting ongoing complexity in tax planning and potential for future tax savings if these positions are ultimately recognized.",

      "question": "How did the regulatory constraints on interchange reimbursement fees evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what impact did these changes have on Visa's competitive positioning and revenue opportunities across this period?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Visa faced increasingly stringent regulatory constraints on interchange reimbursement fees, particularly in the U.S., where the Federal Reserve capped the maximum U.S. debit interchange reimbursement rate for large financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible 1-cent fraud adjustment. In 2022, Visa described interchange fees as a key competitive factor influencing transaction volumes. By 2023, regulatory scrutiny intensified, with the Federal Reserve revisiting Dodd-Frank Act regulations, including requirements for issuers to support at least two unaffiliated networks. This trend continued into 2024, with Visa noting that evolving global regulations were increasing compliance costs and reducing revenue opportunities. These constraints collectively limited Visa\u2019s ability to differentiate its offerings and maintain competitive positioning in key markets.",

(1)\n\n## OUR CORE BUSINESS\n\nIn  an  example  of  a  typical  Visa  C2B  payment  transaction,  the  consumer  purchases  goods  or  services  from  a merchant using a Visa card or payment product. The merchant presents the transaction data to an acquirer, usually a bank or third-party processing firm that supports acceptance of Visa cards or payment products, for verification and processing. Through VisaNet, the acquirer presents the transaction data to Visa, which in turn contacts the issuer to check  the  account  holder's  account  or  credit  line  for  authorization.  After  the  transaction  is  authorized,  the  issuer effectively pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange reimbursement fee, and then posts the transaction to the consumer's account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, minus the merchant discount rate (MDR), to the merchant.\n\nVisa  earns  revenue  by  facilitating  money  movement  across  more  than  200  countries  and  territories  among  a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. Net revenues  consist  of  service  revenues,  data  processing  revenues,  international  transaction  revenues  and  other revenues, minus client incentive arrangements we have with our clients. We have one reportable segment, which is Payment Services. We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business.\n\nVisa is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products nor do we earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, any of these activities. Interchange reimbursement fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key",

Risk Factors\n\n## Regulatory Risks\n\n## We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results.\n\nAs  a  global  payments  technology  company,  we  are  subject  to  complex  and  ev olv ing  regulations  that  gov ern  our  operations.  See Item 1 -Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. T he impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules;  affect  our  existing  contractual  arrangements;  increase  our  compliance  costs;  and  require  us  to  make  our  technology  or  intellectual  property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner. As discussed in more detail below , we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing and localization requirements, currency conv ersion, point-of-sale transaction  rules  and  practices,  priv acy,  data  use  and  protection,  licensing  requirements,  and  associated  product  technology. As  a  result,  the  Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country, state to state, or by products. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and operational complexity, and reduces our rev enue opportunities.\n\nIf widely v arying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may hav e difficulty rapidly adjusting our products, serv ices, fees and other important aspects of our business to comply with the regulations. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of  regulations  and  laws,  such  as  regulations  regarding  anti-money  laundering,  anti-corruption,  competition,  money  transfer  serv ices,  priv acy,  and sanctions, and we continually adjust our compliance programs as regulations ev olv e. Howev er, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the ev ent our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civ il and criminal penalties, litigation, inv estigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the ev olv ing and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negativ ely impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the v olume of payments we process, our net rev enue, our brands, our competitiv e positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and serv ices, the quality and types of products and serv ices we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business and financial results.\n\nIncreased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business.\n\nRegulators around the world hav e been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate v arious aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1Government Regulation for more information . In the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, we hav e historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receiv e any rev enue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the rev erse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees  are  a  factor  on  which  we  compete  with  other  payments  prov iders  and  are  therefore  an  important  determinant  of  the  v olume  of  transactions  we process.  Consequently,  changes  to  these  fees,  whether  v oluntarily  or  by  mandate,  can  substantially  affect  our  ov erall  payments  v olumes  and  net rev enue.\n\nInterchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased gov ernment regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions hav e rev iewed or are rev iewing these fees, rules, and practices. For example:\n\n- Regulations  adopted  by  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserv e  cap  the  maximum  U.S.  debit  interchange  reimbursement  rate  receiv ed  by  large  financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act limits issuers' and payment networks' ability to adopt network exclusiv ity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business.  In  response  to  merchant  requests,  the  Federal  Reserv e  has  recently  taken  actions  to  rev isit  its  regulations  that  implement  these aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, in October 2022, the Federal Reserv e published a final rule effectiv ely requiring issuers to ensure that at least two unaffiliated networks",

      "question": "How did Visa's exposure to interchange reimbursement fees evolve from 2022 to 2024, considering the litigation settlements in 2023 and the regulatory risks outlined in 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's strategic and legal positioning around this core revenue determinant?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Visa's exposure to interchange reimbursement fees shifted from being a core competitive determinant in its business model to becoming increasingly constrained by litigation outcomes and regulatory pressures. In 2022, Visa described interchange fees as a key factor in competition with other payment providers, directly influencing transaction volumes and net revenue. By 2023, Visa had paid $600 million as part of the Amended Settlement Agreement related to interchange fee litigation, signaling significant financial exposure tied to these fees. In 2024, Visa highlighted growing regulatory risks, including caps on interchange fees by the U.S. Federal Reserve (e.g., 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction for large institutions), which further limited its ability to influence pricing. This three-year trajectory shows Visa's decreasing control over interchange fees and increasing vulnerability to external legal and regulatory forces.",

(1)\n\n## OUR CORE BUSINESS\n\nIn  an  example  of  a  typical  Visa  C2B  payment  transaction,  the  consumer  purchases  goods  or  services  from  a merchant using a Visa card or payment product. The merchant presents the transaction data to an acquirer, usually a bank or third-party processing firm that supports acceptance of Visa cards or payment products, for verification and processing. Through VisaNet, the acquirer presents the transaction data to Visa, which in turn contacts the issuer to check  the  account  holder's  account  or  credit  line  for  authorization.  After  the  transaction  is  authorized,  the  issuer effectively pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange reimbursement fee, and then posts the transaction to the consumer's account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, minus the merchant discount rate (MDR), to the merchant.\n\nVisa  earns  revenue  by  facilitating  money  movement  across  more  than  200  countries  and  territories  among  a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. Net revenues  consist  of  service  revenues,  data  processing  revenues,  international  transaction  revenues  and  other revenues, minus client incentive arrangements we have with our clients. We have one reportable segment, which is Payment Services. We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business.\n\nVisa is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products nor do we earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, any of these activities. Interchange reimbursement fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key",

Risk Factors\n\n## Regulatory Risks\n\n## We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results.\n\nAs  a  global  payments  technology  company,  we  are  subject  to  complex  and  ev olv ing  regulations  that  gov ern  our  operations.  See Item 1 -Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. T he impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules;  affect  our  existing  contractual  arrangements;  increase  our  compliance  costs;  and  require  us  to  make  our  technology  or  intellectual  property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner. As discussed in more detail below , we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing and localization requirements, currency conv ersion, point-of-sale transaction  rules  and  practices,  priv acy,  data  use  and  protection,  licensing  requirements,  and  associated  product  technology. As  a  result,  the  Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country, state to state, or by products. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and operational complexity, and reduces our rev enue opportunities.\n\nIf widely v arying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may hav e difficulty rapidly adjusting our products, serv ices, fees and other important aspects of our business to comply with the regulations. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of  regulations  and  laws,  such  as  regulations  regarding  anti-money  laundering,  anti-corruption,  competition,  money  transfer  serv ices,  priv acy,  and sanctions, and we continually adjust our compliance programs as regulations ev olv e. Howev er, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the ev ent our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civ il and criminal penalties, litigation, inv estigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the ev olv ing and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negativ ely impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the v olume of payments we process, our net rev enue, our brands, our competitiv e positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and serv ices, the quality and types of products and serv ices we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business and financial results.\n\nIncreased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business.\n\nRegulators around the world hav e been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate v arious aspects of the payments industry.

In 2022, Visa noted that litigation outcomes, particularly U.S. covered litigation, could force modifications to default interchange rates and that retrospective responsibility plans might not fully insulate the company from financial liability. In 2023, Visa specifically cited the European Commission settlement on cross-border interchange rates as a precedent that attracted regulatory attention globally, and it noted that the inability to set optimal interchange rates led to issuers and acquirers finding alternative payment systems more attractive. By 2024, Visa acknowledged that litigation and regulatory pressures had already impacted its business practices, including the need to modify interchange reimbursement rates and operating rules, with potential ripple effects across jurisdictions.

Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, many factors may limit their accuracy. We are currently under examination by, or in disputes with, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service, the UK's HM Revenue and Customs as well as tax authorities in other jurisdictions, and we may be subject to additional examinations or disputes in  the  future.  Relevant  tax  authorities  may  disagree  with  our  tax  treatment  of  certain  material  items  and  thereby increase our tax liability. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could harm our cash flow and financial position. In  addition,  changes  in  existing  laws  in  the  U.S.  or  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  unilateral  actions  of  foreign jurisdictions to introduce digital services taxes, or changes resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development's Program of Work, related to the revision of profit allocation and nexus rules and design of a system to  ensure  multinational  enterprises  pay  a  minimum  level  of  tax  to  the  countries  where  we  earn  revenue,  may  also materially affect our effective tax rate. A substantial increase in our tax payments could have a material, adverse effect on our financial results. See also Note 19-Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report.\n\n## Litigation Risks\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations.\n\nWe  are  involved  in  numerous  litigation  matters,  investigations,  and  proceedings  asserted  by  civil  litigants, governments,  and  enforcement  bodies  investigating  or  alleging,  among  other  things,  violations  of  competition  and antitrust law, consumer protection law, privacy law and intellectual property law (these are referred to as 'actions' in this section).  Details  of  the  most  significant  actions  we  face  are  described  more  fully  in Note  20-Legal Matters to  our consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8-Financial  Statements  and  Supplementary  Data of  this  report. These actions are inherently uncertain, expensive and disruptive to our operations. In the event we are found liable or reach a settlement in any action, particularly in a large class action lawsuit, such as one involving an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages in the U.S., or we incur liability arising from a government investigation, we may be  required  to  pay  significant  awards,  settlements  or  fines.  In  addition,  settlement  terms,  judgments,  orders  or pressures resulting from actions may harm our business by influencing or requiring us to modify, among other things, the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, the Visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. These actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators, investigators,  governments  or  civil  litigants  in  the  same  or  other  jurisdictions,  which  may  lead  to  additional  actions against Visa. Finally, we are required by some of our commercial agreements to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them, even if Visa is not a defendant.\n\nFor certain actions like those that are U.S. covered litigation or VE territory covered litigation, as described in Note 5-U.S.  and  Europe  Retrospective  Responsibility  Plans and Note  20-Legal  Matters to  our  consolidated  financial statements included in Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, we have certain financial protections pursuant to the respective retrospective responsibility plans. The two retrospective responsibility plans are different in the protections they provide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. The failure of one or both of the retrospective responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or even cause us to become insolvent.\n\n## Business Risks\n\n## We face intense competition in our industry.\n\nThe  global  payments  space  is  intensely  competitive.  As  technology  evolves,  new  competitors  or  methods  of payment  emerge,  and  existing  clients  and  competitors  assume  different  roles.  Our  products  compete  with  cash, checks, electronic funds, virtual currency payments, global or multi-regional networks, other domestic and closed-loop payments systems, digital wallets and alternative payments providers primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce  and  mobile  channels.  As  the  global  payments  space  becomes  more  complex,  we  face  increasing competition from our clients, other emerging payment providers such as fintechs, other digital payments, technology companies that have developed payments systems enabled through online activity in ecommerce, social media, and mobile channels, as well as governments in a number of jurisdictions (e.g., Brazil and India) as",

We also may need to prov ide increased care in our data management, governance and quality practices, particularly as it relates to the use of data in products lev eraging AI.\n\n## We may be subject to tax examinations or disputes, or changes in tax laws.\n\nThe application of tax laws requires significant judgment and can be subject to uncertainty and differing interpretations. We are currently under examination  by,  or  in  disputes  with,  the  U.S.  Internal  Rev enue  Serv ice  as  well  as  tax  authorities  in  other  jurisdictions,  and  we  may  be  subject  to additional examinations or disputes in the future. We exercise significant judgment and make estimates that we believ e to be reasonable in calculating our worldwide prov ision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. Howev er, relev ant tax authorities may disagree with our estimates, interpretations or tax treatment of certain material items. Failure to sustain our position in these matters could adv ersely affect our cash flows and financial position.\n\nIn  addition,  changes  in  existing  laws  in  the  U.S.  or  foreign  jurisdictions,  including  unilateral  actions  of  foreign  jurisdictions  to  introduce  digital serv ices taxes, or changes resulting from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Dev elopment's proposals for modernizing the international tax system, including the introduction of a global minimum tax with widespread implementation by member countries expected by 2025, may also materially affect  our  effectiv e  tax  rate  and  could  increase  our  tax  payments.  Please  see Item  7 and Note  19-Income  Taxes to  our  consolidated  financial statements included in Item 8 of this report.\n\n## Litigation Risks\n\n## We may be adversely affected by the outcome of litigation or investigations.\n\nWe are involv ed in numerous litigation matters, inv estigations, and proceedings asserted by civ il litigants, gov ernments, and enforcement bodies inv estigating or alleging, among other things, v iolations of competition and antitrust law , consumer protection law , priv acy law and intellectual property law (these are referred to as 'actions' in this section). Details of the most significant actions we face are described more fully in Note 20-Legal Matters to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in Item  8 of  this  report.  T hese  actions  are  inherently  uncertain,  expensiv e  and  disruptiv e  to  our operations. In the ev ent we are found liable or reach a settlement in any action, particularly in a large class action lawsuit, such as one inv olv ing an antitrust claim entitling the plaintiff to treble damages in the U.S., or we incur liability arising from a gov ernment inv estigation, we may be required to pay significant awards or judgments, settlements, costs or fines. In addition, settlement terms, judgments, orders, pressures or ev ents in or resulting from actions hav e impacted and may continue to impact our business by creating uncertainty for our business or by influencing or requiring us to modify, among other things, the default interchange reimbursement rates we set, the Visa operating rules or the way in which we enforce those rules, our fees or pricing, or the way we do business. These actions or their outcomes may also influence regulators, inv estigators, gov ernments or civ il litigants in the same or other jurisdictions,  which  may  lead  to  additional  actions  against  Visa.  Finally,  we  are  required  by  some  of  our  commercial  agreements  to indemnify other entities for litigation brought against them, ev en if Visa is not a defendant.\n\nFor  certain  actions  like  those  that  are  U.S.  cov ered  litigation  or  VE  territory  cov ered  litigation,  as  described  in Note  5-U.S.  and  Europe Retrospective Responsibility Plans and Note 20-Legal Matters to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this report, we hav e certain financial protections pursuant to the respectiv e retrospectiv e responsibility plans. The two retrospectiv e responsibility plans are different in the protections they prov ide and the mechanisms by which we are protected. The failure of one or both of the retrospectiv e responsibility plans to adequately insulate us from the impact of such settlements, judgments, losses, or liabilities could materially harm our financial condition or cash flows, or ev en cause us to become insolvent.\n\n## Business Risks\n\n## We face intense competition in our industry.\n\nThe global payments space is intensely competitiv e. As technology ev olv es and consumer expectations change, new competitors or methods of payment emerge, and existing clients and competitors assume different roles. Our products compete with cash, checks, electronic payments, v irtual currency  payments,  global  or  multi-regional  networks,  other  domestic  and  closed-loop  payments  systems,  digital  wallets  and  alternativ e  payments prov iders primarily focused on enabling payments through ecommerce and mobile channels. As the global payments space becomes more complex, we face increasing competition from our clients, other emerging payment prov iders such as fintechs, other digital payments, technology companies that have developed payments systems",

      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, interchange reimbursement fees were described as a core component of Visa\u2019s value proposition to merchants, though no specific liability figure was disclosed. By fiscal 2023, the estimated interchange reimbursement fees at issue in unresolved U.S. covered litigation stood at $49.6 billion as of October 1, 2023, and by fiscal 2024, this figure had only slightly declined to $48.4 billion as of October 1, 2024. This minimal reduction over two years suggests limited progress in resolving these legal claims and indicates that Visa continues to face substantial financial exposure and ongoing legal risk related to interchange fee structures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\n## Regulatory Risks\n\n## We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results.\n\nAs  a  global  payments  technology  company,  we  are  subject  to  complex  and  ev olv ing  regulations  that  gov ern  our  operations.  See Item 1 -Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. T he impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules;  affect  our  existing  contractual  arrangements;  increase  our  compliance  costs;  and  require  us  to  make  our  technology  or  intellectual  property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner. As discussed in more detail below , we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing and localization requirements, currency conv ersion, point-of-sale transaction  rules  and  practices,  priv acy,  data  use  and  protection,  licensing  requirements,  and  associated  product  technology. As  a  result,  the  Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country, state to state, or by products. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and operational complexity, and reduces our rev enue opportunities.\n\nIf widely v arying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may hav e difficulty rapidly adjusting our products, serv ices, fees and other important aspects of our business to comply with the regulations. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of  regulations  and  laws,  such  as  regulations  regarding  anti-money  laundering,  anti-corruption,  competition,  money  transfer  serv ices,  priv acy,  and sanctions, and we continually adjust our compliance programs as regulations ev olv e. Howev er, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the ev ent our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civ il and criminal penalties, litigation, inv estigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the ev olv ing and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negativ ely impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the v olume of payments we process, our net rev enue, our brands, our competitiv e positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and serv ices, the quality and types of products and serv ices we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business and financial results.\n\nIncreased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business.\n\nRegulators around the world hav e been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate v arious aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1Government Regulation for more information . In the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, we hav e historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receiv e any rev enue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the rev erse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees  are  a  factor  on  which  we  compete  with  other  payments  prov iders  and  are  therefore  an  important  determinant  of  the  v olume  of  transactions  we process.  Consequently,  changes  to  these  fees,  whether  v oluntarily  or  by  mandate,  can  substantially  affect  our  ov erall  payments  v olumes  and  net rev enue.\n\nInterchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased gov ernment regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions hav e rev iewed or are rev iewing these fees, rules, and practices. For example:\n\n- Regulations  adopted  by  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserv e  cap  the  maximum  U.S.  debit  interchange  reimbursement  rate  receiv ed  by  large  financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act limits issuers' and payment networks' ability to adopt network exclusiv ity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business.  In  response  to  merchant  requests,  the  Federal  Reserv e  has  recently  taken  actions  to  rev isit  its  regulations  that  implement  these aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, in October 2022, the Federal Reserv e published a final rule effectiv ely requiring issuers to ensure that at least two unaffiliated networks",

(1)\n\n## OUR CORE BUSINESS\n\nIn  an  example  of  a  typical  Visa  C2B  payment  transaction,  the  consumer  purchases  goods  or  services  from  a merchant using a Visa card or payment product. The merchant presents the transaction data to an acquirer, usually a bank or third-party processing firm that supports acceptance of Visa cards or payment products, for verification and processing. Through VisaNet, the acquirer presents the transaction data to Visa, which in turn contacts the issuer to check  the  account  holder's  account  or  credit  line  for  authorization.  After  the  transaction  is  authorized,  the  issuer effectively pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange reimbursement fee, and then posts the transaction to the consumer's account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, minus the merchant discount rate (MDR), to the merchant.\n\nVisa  earns  revenue  by  facilitating  money  movement  across  more  than  200  countries  and  territories  among  a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. Net revenues  consist  of  service  revenues,  data  processing  revenues,  international  transaction  revenues  and  other revenues, minus client incentive arrangements we have with our clients. We have one reportable segment, which is Payment Services. We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business.\n\nVisa is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products nor do we earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, any of these activities. Interchange reimbursement fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key",

      "question": "How did BNY Mellon's exposure to credit rating risks evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year progression reveal about the company's financial condition stability amid changing macroeconomic pressures?",
      "answer": "In 2022, BNY Mellon identified that a material reduction in credit ratings for the company or its subsidiaries could increase funding costs and have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition. In 2023, the company reiterated this risk, specifically naming its principal bank subsidiaries\u2014The Bank of New York Mellon, BNY Mellon, N.A., and The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV\u2014emphasizing that credit rating reductions could increase borrowing costs and negatively affect its financial condition and securities value. In 2024, the company maintained the same risk language, continuing to highlight the same subsidiaries and adding that such rating changes could also affect its liquidity and financial condition. The consistent emphasis across all three years indicates a stable but persistent vulnerability to credit rating fluctuations, suggesting that despite macroeconomic shifts\u2014including the lingering effects of the pandemic in 2022 and geopolitical tensions in 2024\u2014the firm's exposure to rating-related financial risk has not materially decreased.",

        "Hop 2: [BK](2024) \u2192 Reported Financial Condition: In 2024, the firm reiterated the same risk about credit ratings, again naming the same subsidiaries, and added that such reductions could also impact liquidity, signaling a broadening of the potential consequences.",
        "Hop 3: [BK](2022) \u2192 Reported Financial Condition: In 2022, the company identified that a material reduction in credit ratings could increase funding costs and have a material adverse effect on its business and financial condition, though it did not name all subsidiaries explicitly as in later years."

      "answer": "In 2022, BK included 'Information on Stock Ownership' within the 'Additional Information' section, alongside 'Equity Compensation Plans,' without explicit cross-references to other sections. In 2023, the structure remained consistent, with the same placement under 'Additional Information,' but added a reference to 'Director Compensation' under 'Item 1 - Election of Directors,' suggesting a subtle integration with executive compensation disclosures. By 2024, the placement under 'Additional Information' persisted, yet there was a more pronounced linkage to 'Corporate Governance and Board Information' and 'Human Resources and Compensation Committee' sections, indicating a growing thematic alignment between ownership data and governance structures. This evolution shows a gradual shift toward contextualizing stock ownership not just as a standalone metric but as part of broader corporate governance and executive accountability frameworks.",

This amount increased to $1.6 billion in fiscal 2023, and further rose to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2024. The upward trend from 2022 to 2023 suggests growing potential for future tax savings, although there was a slight decline in fiscal 2024, indicating some fluctuation in the company's uncertain tax positions.

      "answer": "The decline in Visa's 'Right to Recover for Covered Losses' from $140 million in 2023 to $104 million in 2024, following the $3.5 billion release in 2022, reflects a strategic and systematic reduction of the company's exposure to VE territory litigation liabilities. In 2022, Visa executed the Sixth Anniversary Release under the Europe retrospective responsibility plan, releasing $3.5 billion in as-converted value from its Series B and C preferred stock, which marked the beginning of this liability reduction. By 2023, the 'Right to Recover for Covered Losses' had decreased to $140 million, indicating that the company had already significantly reduced its potential recovery mechanism. In 2024, this balance further declined to $104 million, with $139 million in VE territory covered losses incurred and $175 million in recoveries through conversion rate adjustments. This consistent reduction suggests that Visa is proactively managing its litigation liabilities by utilizing the preferred stock conversion mechanism, thereby reducing its reliance on this recovery mechanism over time and signaling confidence in its ability to manage remaining liabilities without further equity adjustments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## VISA INC.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\nSeptember 30, 2022\n\nCommittee, which is composed of representatives of certain Visa Europe members, has also been granted consent rights to approve certain material decisions in relation to the VE territory covered litigation.\n\nThe Company obtained certain protections for VE territory covered losses through the series B and C preferred stock, the UK loss sharing agreement, and the litigation management deed, referred to as the 'Europe retrospective responsibility plan.' The plan covers VE territory covered litigation (and resultant liabilities and losses) relating to the covered period, which generally refers to the period before the Closing. Visa's protection from the plan is further limited to 70% of any liabilities where the claim relates to inter-regional multilateral interchange fee rates where the issuer is located outside the Visa Europe territory, and the merchant is located within the Visa Europe territory. The plan does not  protect  the  Company  in  Europe  against  all  types  of  litigation  or  remedies  or  fines  imposed  in  competition  law enforcement proceedings, only the interchange litigation specifically covered by the plan's terms.\n\nUnlike  the  U.S.  retrospective  responsibility  plan,  the  Europe  retrospective  responsibility  plan  does  not  have  an escrow account that is used to fund settlements or judgments. The Company is entitled to recover VE territory covered losses through a periodic adjustment to the class A common stock conversion rates applicable to the series B and C preferred  stock.  The  total  amount  of  protection  available  through  the  preferred  stock  component  of  the  Europe retrospective responsibility plan is equivalent to the as-converted value of the preferred stock, which can be calculated at  any  point  in  time  as  the  product  of:  (a)  the  outstanding  number  of  shares  of  preferred  stock;  (b)  the  current conversion rate applicable to each class of preferred stock; and (c) Visa's class A common stock price. This amount differs  from  the  value  of  the  preferred  stock  recorded  within  stockholders'  equity  on  the  Company's  consolidated balance  sheets.  The  book  value  of  the  preferred  stock  reflects  its  historical  value  recorded  at  the  Closing  less  VE territory  covered  losses  recovered  through  a  reduction  of  the  applicable  conversion  rate.  The  book  value  does  not reflect changes in the underlying class A common stock price subsequent to the Closing.\n\nVisa  Inc.  net  income  is  not  impacted  by  VE  territory  covered  losses  as  long  as  the  as-converted  value  of  the preferred stock is greater than the covered loss. VE territory covered losses are recorded when the loss is deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable, or in the case of attorney's fees, when incurred. Concurrently, the Company records  a  reduction  to  stockholders'  equity,  which  represents  the  Company's  right  to  recover  such  losses  through adjustments to the conversion rate applicable to the preferred stock. The reduction to stockholders' equity is recorded in a contra-equity account referred to as 'right to recover for covered losses.'\n\nVE territory covered losses may be recorded before the corresponding adjustment to the applicable conversion rate is effected. Adjustments to the conversion rate may be executed once in any six-month period unless a single, individual loss greater than \u20ac20 million is incurred, in which case, the six-month limitation does not apply. When the adjustment to the conversion rate is made, the amount previously recorded in 'right to recover for covered losses' as contra-equity is then recorded against the book value of the preferred stock within stockholders' equity.\n\nAs  required  by  the  litigation  management  deed,  on  June  21,  2022,  the  sixth  anniversary  of  the  Visa  Europe acquisition,  Visa,  in  consultation  with  the  VE  Territory  Litigation  Management  Committee,  carried  out  a  release assessment. After the completion of this assessment, the Company released $3.5 billion of the as-converted value from its  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock  and  issued  176,655  shares  of  series A  preferred  stock  on  July  29,  2022  (Sixth Anniversary  Release).  Each  holder  of  a  share  of  series  B  and  C  preferred  stock  received  a  number  of  series  A preferred stock equal to the applicable conversion adjustment divided by 100. The Company paid $3 million in cash in lieu of issuing fractional shares of series A preferred stock. Each share of series A preferred stock will be automatically converted  into  100  shares  of  class A  common  stock  in  connection  with  a  sale  to  a  person  eligible  to  hold  class A common stock in accordance with Visa's certificate of incorporation.

Meanwhile, the company's Singapore tax incentives increased steadily, from $362 million in fiscal 2022 to $419 million in fiscal 2024, showing a growing benefit from its Asia Pacific tax hub.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Visa's exposure to interchange reimbursement fees evolved significantly across litigation, regulatory, and operational dimensions. In 2022, interchange fees were described as a core component of Visa's payment ecosystem, reflecting the value merchants receive from accepting Visa products and playing a key role in the competitive dynamics of payment networks. By 2024, Visa faced heightened regulatory scrutiny globally, including mandated caps on interchange fees (e.g., the U.S. Federal Reserve's cap of 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction for large financial institutions), which directly impacted transaction volumes and net revenue. In 2023, Visa disclosed a $49.6 billion estimated interchange reimbursement fee exposure tied to unresolved U.S. covered litigation claims as of October 1, 2023, which only slightly decreased to $48.4 billion by October 1, 2024, indicating ongoing legal risk. This three-year trajectory shows that while interchange fees remain central to Visa\u2019s business model, they are increasingly constrained by regulation and litigation, forcing Visa to adapt its competitive and compliance strategies in global markets.",

(1)\n\n## OUR CORE BUSINESS\n\nIn  an  example  of  a  typical  Visa  C2B  payment  transaction,  the  consumer  purchases  goods  or  services  from  a merchant using a Visa card or payment product. The merchant presents the transaction data to an acquirer, usually a bank or third-party processing firm that supports acceptance of Visa cards or payment products, for verification and processing. Through VisaNet, the acquirer presents the transaction data to Visa, which in turn contacts the issuer to check  the  account  holder's  account  or  credit  line  for  authorization.  After  the  transaction  is  authorized,  the  issuer effectively pays the acquirer an amount equal to the value of the transaction, minus the interchange reimbursement fee, and then posts the transaction to the consumer's account. The acquirer pays the amount of the purchase, minus the merchant discount rate (MDR), to the merchant.\n\nVisa  earns  revenue  by  facilitating  money  movement  across  more  than  200  countries  and  territories  among  a global set of consumers, merchants, financial institutions and government entities through innovative technologies. Net revenues  consist  of  service  revenues,  data  processing  revenues,  international  transaction  revenues  and  other revenues, minus client incentive arrangements we have with our clients. We have one reportable segment, which is Payment Services. We generally do not experience any pronounced seasonality in our business.\n\nVisa is not a financial institution. We do not issue cards, extend credit or set rates and fees for account holders of Visa products nor do we earn revenues from, or bear credit risk with respect to, any of these activities. Interchange reimbursement fees reflect the value merchants receive from accepting our products and play a key",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\n## Regulatory Risks\n\n## We are subject to complex and evolving global regulations that could harm our business and financial results.\n\nAs  a  global  payments  technology  company,  we  are  subject  to  complex  and  ev olv ing  regulations  that  gov ern  our  operations.  See Item 1 -Government Regulation for more information on the most significant areas of regulation that affect our business. T he impact of these regulations on us, our clients, and other third parties could limit our ability to enforce our payments system rules; require us to adopt new rules or change existing rules;  affect  our  existing  contractual  arrangements;  increase  our  compliance  costs;  and  require  us  to  make  our  technology  or  intellectual  property available to third parties, including competitors, in an undesirable manner. As discussed in more detail below , we may face differing rules and regulations in matters like interchange reimbursement rates, preferred routing, domestic processing and localization requirements, currency conv ersion, point-of-sale transaction  rules  and  practices,  priv acy,  data  use  and  protection,  licensing  requirements,  and  associated  product  technology. As  a  result,  the  Visa operating rules and our other contractual commitments may differ from country to country, state to state, or by products. Complying with these and other regulations increases our costs and operational complexity, and reduces our rev enue opportunities.\n\nIf widely v arying regulations come into existence worldwide, we may hav e difficulty rapidly adjusting our products, serv ices, fees and other important aspects of our business to comply with the regulations. Our compliance programs and policies are designed to support our compliance with a wide array of  regulations  and  laws,  such  as  regulations  regarding  anti-money  laundering,  anti-corruption,  competition,  money  transfer  serv ices,  priv acy,  and sanctions, and we continually adjust our compliance programs as regulations ev olv e. Howev er, we cannot guarantee that our practices will be deemed compliant by all applicable regulatory authorities. In the ev ent our controls should fail or we are found to be out of compliance for other reasons, we could be subject to monetary damages, civ il and criminal penalties, litigation, inv estigations and proceedings, and damage to our global brands and reputation. Furthermore, the ev olv ing and increased regulatory focus on the payments industry could negativ ely impact or reduce the number of Visa products our clients issue, the v olume of payments we process, our net rev enue, our brands, our competitiv e positioning, our ability to use our intellectual property to differentiate our products and serv ices, the quality and types of products and serv ices we offer, the countries in which our products are used, and the types of consumers and merchants who can obtain or accept our products, all of which could harm our business and financial results.\n\nIncreased scrutiny and regulation of the global payments industry, including with respect to interchange reimbursement fees, merchant discount rates, operating rules, risk management protocols and other related practices, could harm our business.\n\nRegulators around the world hav e been establishing or increasing their authority to regulate v arious aspects of the payments industry. See Item 1Government Regulation for more information . In the U.S. and many other jurisdictions, we hav e historically set default interchange reimbursement fees. Even though we generally do not receiv e any rev enue related to interchange reimbursement fees in a payment transaction (in the context of credit and debit transactions, those fees are paid by the acquirers to the issuers; the rev erse is true for certain transactions like ATM), interchange reimbursement fees  are  a  factor  on  which  we  compete  with  other  payments  prov iders  and  are  therefore  an  important  determinant  of  the  v olume  of  transactions  we process.  Consequently,  changes  to  these  fees,  whether  v oluntarily  or  by  mandate,  can  substantially  affect  our  ov erall  payments  v olumes  and  net rev enue.\n\nInterchange reimbursement fees, certain operating rules and related practices continue to be subject to increased gov ernment regulation globally, and regulatory authorities and central banks in a number of jurisdictions hav e rev iewed or are rev iewing these fees, rules, and practices. For example:\n\n- Regulations  adopted  by  the  U.S.  Federal  Reserv e  cap  the  maximum  U.S.  debit  interchange  reimbursement  rate  receiv ed  by  large  financial institutions at 21 cents plus 5 basis points per transaction, plus a possible fraud adjustment of 1 cent. Additionally, the Dodd-Frank Act limits issuers' and payment networks' ability to adopt network exclusiv ity and preferred routing in the debit and prepaid area, which also impacts our business.  In  response  to  merchant  requests,  the  Federal  Reserv e  has  recently  taken  actions  to  rev isit  its  regulations  that  implement  these aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act. For example, in October 2022, the Federal Reserv e published a final rule effectiv ely requiring issuers to ensure that at least two unaffiliated networks",

When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments  unless  the  retrospective  impact  of  process  improvements  or  enhancements  is  determined  by  management  to  be material.\n\n## NET REVENUES\n\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n\n- Transaction  revenues :  Net  transaction  fees  primarily  charged  to  merchants  on  a  transaction  basis  based  on  the  TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable  on  our  payments  platform.  We  earn  additional  fees  from  merchants  and  consumers  on  transactions  where  we perform  currency  conversion,  where  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the  merchant  and consumer  are  in  different  countries),  to  facilitate  the  instant  transfer  of  funds  for  our  customers  from  their  PayPal  or Venmo account  to  their  debit  card  or  bank  account,  to  facilitate  the  purchase  and  sale  of  cryptocurrencies,  and  other miscellaneous fees.\n- Revenues  from  other  value  added  services: Net  revenues  derived  primarily  from  revenue  earned  through  partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues  from  interest  and  fees  earned  on  our  portfolio  of  loans  receivable,  and  interest  earned  on  certain  assets underlying customer balances.\n\nOur revenues can be significantly impacted by, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- The mix of merchants, products, and services;\n- The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;\n- The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and\n- The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.\n\nRefer to 'Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors' in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that impact our revenue.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal indicated that transaction revenues were directly correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions, with management using these metrics to evaluate platform strength and customer engagement. By 2023, despite continued TPV and transaction growth, transaction revenue growth lagged due to declines in core PayPal product revenues, unfavorable hedging impacts, and lower foreign currency exchange fees. In 2024, PayPal continued to emphasize TPV and transaction counts as key performance indicators, but also highlighted increasing use of incentives and protection programs that directly impacted revenue recognition and transaction cost structures.

Evaluating  whether  an  incentive  is  a  payment  to  a  customer  requires  judgment.  Incentives  that  are  determined  to  be consideration payable to a customer or paid on behalf of a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue. Incentives based on performance targets are recorded as a reduction to revenue when earned based on management's estimate of each customer's future performance, and incentives not based on performance targets are amortized as a reduction of revenue ratably over the contractual term. Certain incentives paid to users that are not our customers are classified as sales and marketing expense.\n\nWe provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. These protection programs help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss, resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These protection programs do not  provide  a  separate  service  to  our  customers  and  we  estimate  and  record  associated  costs  in  transaction  and  credit  losses  during  the  period  the  payment transaction is completed.\n\n## REVENUES FROM OTHER VALUE ADDED SERVICES\n\nWe earn revenues from other value added services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees,  and  other  services  that  we  provide  to  our  consumers  and  merchants.  These  contracts  typically  have one  performance  obligation  which  is  provided  and recognized over the term of the contract. The transaction price is generally fix ed and known at the end of each reporting period; however, for some agreements, it may be necessary to estimate the transaction price using the expected value method. Revenue earned from other value added services is recorded on a net basis when we are considered the agent with respect to processing transactions.\n\nWe also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances. Interest and fees earned on the portfolio of loans receivable are computed and recognized based on the effective interest method and are presented net of any required reserves and amortization of deferred origination costs.\n\nWe record a contract asset when we have a conditional right to consideration for services we have already transferred to our customer. These contract assets are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and were $207 million and $185 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE\n\nWe believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.\n\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market and category:\n\n",

      "answer": "From 2022 through 2024, PayPal's transaction revenues consistently grew at a slower rate than both TPV and the number of payment transactions. In 2022, transaction revenue growth lagged due to a decline in eBay's marketplace TPV (where PayPal historically earned higher rates), lower growth in foreign exchange fees, a higher proportion of TPV coming from Braintree and large merchants (which generally pay lower rates), and an unfavorable impact from hedging. In 2023, the underperformance continued, driven by declines in revenues from core PayPal products and services, continued unfavorable hedging impacts, and further reductions in foreign currency exchange fees. By 2024, while PayPal provided a more detailed breakdown of transaction revenues\u2014including fee refunds, cross-border transactions, and incentives\u2014it remained clear that structural shifts in the business, such as the increasing share of lower-margin transaction channels and evolving pricing models, continued to suppress revenue growth relative to volume.

We do not own the receivables  associated  with  loans  originated  through  the  PPP. The  fee  revenue  associated  with  the  PPP  loans  in  the  year  ended December 31, 2021 was $157 million, which included revenue recognized upon loan forgiveness and the extinguishment of our servicing obligations for a portion of the outstanding loans. At December 31, 2021, the remaining unearned fee revenue associated with the PPP loans was not material. The growth in revenue from other value added services in the year ended December 31, 2021 was also attributable  to  an  increase  in  interest  and  fee  revenue  on  our  consumer  loans  receivable  portfolio  driven  primarily  by growth in international markets, partially offset by a decline in interest and fee revenue on our merchant loans receivable portfolio due to a decrease in average outstanding loans year-over-year and a decline in interest earned on certain assets underlying customer account balances resulting from lower interest rates.\n\nThe  total  gross  consumer  and  merchant  loans  receivable  balance  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020  was  $5.3  billion  and $3.6  billion,  respectively,  reflecting  a  year-over-year  increase  of  48%  driven  primarily  by  growth  in  our  consumer  receivable portfolio due to the expansion of our installment credit products, including the entry into new markets.\n\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we took both proactive and reactive measures during 2020 to support our merchants and consumers that had loans and interest receivables due to us under our credit product offerings. These measures were intended to help reduce financial difficulties experienced by our customers and included providing payment holidays to grant payment deferrals to certain borrowers for varying periods of time, and amended payment terms through loan modifications in certain cases. Given the uncertainty surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including its duration and severity, related global economic conditions and the ultimate impact it may have on the financial condition of our merchants and consumers, the extent of these types of actions and their prospective impact on our interest and fee income is not determinable. In addition, consumers that have outstanding loans and interest  receivable  due  to  Synchrony  may experience similar hardships that result in increased losses recognized by Synchrony, which may result in a decrease in our revenue share earned from Synchrony in future periods. In the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by Synchrony does not meet a minimum rate of return ('minimum return threshold') in a particular quarter, our revenue share for that period would be zero. Further, in the event the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs managed by Synchrony does not meet the minimum return threshold as measured over four consecutive quarters and  in  the  following  quarter,  we  would  be  required  to  make  a  payment  to  Synchrony,  subject  to  certain  limitations.  Through December 31, 2021, the overall return on the PayPal branded credit programs funded by Synchrony exceeded the minimum return threshold.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nThe Company does not experience meaningful seasonality with respect to net revenues. No individual quarter in 2021, 2020, or 2019 accounted for more than 30% of annual net revenue.",

The  amended  guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2024.  For additional information, see 'Note 18-Segment Information.'\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform, which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV ').  We  generate  additional  revenues  from  merchants  and  consumers:  on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew automatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes.  We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using our risk assessment tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments on our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

      "question": "How did the relationship between PayPal's transaction revenues and the growth in payment transactions evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what factors explain the persistent gap between TPV growth and transaction revenue growth across this period?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's transaction revenues consistently grew at a slower rate than TPV and the number of payment transactions, driven by structural and market-related factors. In 2022, this was attributed to a decline in eBay's marketplace TPV (where PayPal historically earned higher rates), lower growth in foreign exchange fees, and a higher proportion of TPV coming from Braintree and large merchants, which typically pay lower rates. In 2023, the gap persisted due to declines in revenues from core PayPal products, unfavorable hedging impacts, and continued weakness in foreign currency exchange fees. By 2024, while the financial statements indicate a more refined revenue recognition framework, the structural dynamics\u2014such as incentives reducing effective revenue and the mix of TPV sources\u2014remained, suggesting that the company continued to face pricing pressure and operational trade-offs between volume and margin. This 3-year trend reveals a sustained challenge in monetizing transaction growth effectively.",

Changes in prices charged to our customers did not significantly impact transaction revenue growth in 2021.\n\n## Revenues from other value added services\n\nRevenues from other value added services increased by $433 million, or 28%, in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to increases in our revenue share with Synchrony Bank ('Synchrony') and fee revenue from the servicing of loans under the U.S government's Paycheck Protection Program ('PPP') administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration ('SBA') and enacted in March 2020 under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Evaluating  whether  an  incentive  is  a  payment  to  a  customer  requires  judgment.  Incentives  that  are  determined  to  be consideration payable to a customer or paid on behalf of a customer are recognized as a reduction of revenue. Incentives based on performance targets are recorded as a reduction to revenue when earned based on management's estimate of each customer's future performance, and incentives not based on performance targets are amortized as a reduction of revenue ratably over the contractual term. Certain incentives paid to users that are not our customers are classified as sales and marketing expense.\n\nWe provide merchants and consumers with protection programs for certain purchase transactions completed on our payments platform. These protection programs help protect both merchants and consumers from financial loss, resulting from, among other things, counterparty non-performance. These protection programs do not  provide  a  separate  service  to  our  customers  and  we  estimate  and  record  associated  costs  in  transaction  and  credit  losses  during  the  period  the  payment transaction is completed.\n\n## REVENUES FROM OTHER VALUE ADDED SERVICES\n\nWe earn revenues from other value added services, which are comprised primarily of revenue earned through partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees,  and  other  services  that  we  provide  to  our  consumers  and  merchants.  These  contracts  typically  have one  performance  obligation  which  is  provided  and recognized over the term of the contract. The transaction price is generally fix ed and known at the end of each reporting period; however, for some agreements, it may be necessary to estimate the transaction price using the expected value method. Revenue earned from other value added services is recorded on a net basis when we are considered the agent with respect to processing transactions.\n\nWe also earn revenues from interest and fees earned on our portfolio of loans receivable, and interest earned on certain assets underlying customer balances. Interest and fees earned on the portfolio of loans receivable are computed and recognized based on the effective interest method and are presented net of any required reserves and amortization of deferred origination costs.\n\nWe record a contract asset when we have a conditional right to consideration for services we have already transferred to our customer. These contract assets are included in other assets in our consolidated balance sheets and were $207 million and $185 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## DISAGGREGATION OF REVENUE\n\nWe believe that the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows and how they are affected by economic factors are most appropriately depicted through our primary geographical markets and types of revenue categories (transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services). Revenues recorded within these categories are earned from similar products and services for which the nature of associated fees and the related revenue recognition models are substantially similar.\n\nThe following table presents our revenue disaggregated by primary geographical market and category:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal's transaction revenues were directly correlated with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on its platform, indicating a strong alignment between transactional activity and revenue generation. However, in 2023, transaction revenue growth lagged behind TPV and payment transaction growth due to declines in core PayPal product revenues, unfavorable hedging impacts, and reduced foreign currency exchange fees. By 2024, PayPal continued to generate transaction revenues primarily from payment fees, cross-border transactions, and currency conversion, though the structure of revenue recognition and risk assessment had evolved with new accounting standards and disclosures.

          "chunk_text": "- Number of payment transactions are the total number of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n- Number of payment transactions per active account reflects the total number of payment transactions within the previous 12-month period,  divided  by  active  accounts  at  the  end  of  the  period.  The  number  of  payment  transactions  per  active account provides management with insight into the average number of times a customer account engages in payments activity on our payments platform in a given period.\n- TPV is the value of payments, net of payment reversals, successfully completed on our payments platform or enabled by PayPal via a partner payment solution, not including gateway-exclusive transactions.\n\nAs our transaction revenue is typically correlated  with TPV growth and the number of payment transactions completed on our payments  platform,  management  uses  these  metrics  to  gain  insights  into  the  scale  and  strength  of  our  payments  platform,  the engagement level of our customers, and underlying activity and trends which are indicators of current and future performance. We present these key metrics to enhance investors' evaluation of the performance of our business and operating results.\n\nOur key metrics are calculated using internal company data based on the activity we measure on our platform and may be compiled from multiple systems, including systems that are organically  developed  or  acquired  through  business  combinations. While  the measurement of our key metrics is based on what we believe to be reasonable methodologies and estimates, there are inherent challenges and limitations in measuring our key metrics globally at our scale. The methodologies used to calculate our key metrics require judgment.\n\nWe regularly review our processes for calculating these key metrics, and from time to time we may make adjustments to improve their accuracy or relevance. For example, we continuously apply models, processes and practices designed to detect and prevent fraudulent account creation on our platforms, and work to improve and enhance those capabilities. When we detect a significant volume of illegitimate activity, we generally remove the activity identified from our key metrics. Although such adjustments may impact key metrics reported in prior periods, we generally do not update previously reported key metrics to reflect these subsequent adjustments  unless  the  retrospective  impact  of  process  improvements  or  enhancements  is  determined  by  management  to  be material.\n\n## NET REVENUES\n\nOur revenues are classified into the following two categories:\n\n- Transaction  revenues :  Net  transaction  fees  primarily  charged  to  merchants  on  a  transaction  basis  based  on  the  TPV completed on our payments platform. Growth in TPV is directly impacted by the number of payment transactions that we enable  on  our  payments  platform.  We  earn  additional  fees  from  merchants  and  consumers  on  transactions  where  we perform  currency  conversion,  where  we  enable  cross-border  transactions  (i.e.,  transactions  where  the  merchant  and consumer  are  in  different  countries),  to  facilitate  the  instant  transfer  of  funds  for  our  customers  from  their  PayPal  or Venmo account  to  their  debit  card  or  bank  account,  to  facilitate  the  purchase  and  sale  of  cryptocurrencies,  and  other miscellaneous fees.\n- Revenues  from  other  value  added  services: Net  revenues  derived  primarily  from  revenue  earned  through  partnerships, referral fees, subscription fees, gateway fees, and other services we provide to our merchants and consumers. We also earn revenues  from  interest  and  fees  earned  on  our  portfolio  of  loans  receivable,  and  interest  earned  on  certain  assets underlying customer balances.\n\nOur revenues can be significantly impacted by, but not limited to, the following:\n\n- The mix of merchants, products, and services;\n- The mix between domestic and cross-border transactions;\n- The geographic region or country in which a transaction occurs; and\n- The amount of our loans receivable outstanding with merchants and consumers.\n\nRefer to 'Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors' in this Form 10-K for further discussion on factors that impact our revenue.",

The  amended  guidance requires incremental reportable segment disclosures, primarily about significant segment expenses. The amendments also require entities with a single reportable segment to provide all disclosures required by these amendments, and all existing segment disclosures. The amendments will be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the financial statements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted.  We adopted this guidance in the fourth quarter of 2024.  For additional information, see 'Note 18-Segment Information.'\n\nThere are other new accounting pronouncements issued by the FASB that we have adopted or will adopt, as applicable. We do not believe any of these new accounting pronouncements have had, or will have, a material impact on our consolidated financial statements or disclosures.\n\n## NOTE 2-REVENUE\n\nWe enable our customers to send and receive payments. We earn revenue primarily by completing payment transactions for our customers on our payments platform and from other value added services. Our revenues are classified into two categories: transaction revenues and revenues from other value added services.\n\n## TRANSACTION REVENUES\n\nWe earn transaction revenues primarily from fees paid by our customers to receive payments on our platform. These fees may have a fixed and variable component. The variable component is generally a percentage of the value of the payment amount and is known at the time the transaction is processed. For a portion of our transactions, the variable component of the fee is eligible for reimbursement when the underlying transaction is approved for a refund. We estimate the amount of fee refunds that will be processed each quarter and record a provision against our transaction revenues. The volume of activity processed on our payments platform, which  results  in  transaction  revenue,  is  referred  to  as  Total  Payment  V olume  ('TPV ').  We  generate  additional  revenues  from  merchants  and  consumers:  on transactions where we perform currency conversion, when we enable cross-border transactions (i.e., transactions where the merchant and consumer are in different countries), to facilitate the instant transfer of funds for our customers from their PayPal or V enmo account to their bank account or debit card, to facilitate the purchase and sale of cryptocurrencies, as contractual compensation from sellers that violate our contractual terms (for example, through fraud or counterfeiting), and other miscellaneous fees. Our transaction revenues are also reduced by certain incentives provided to our customers.\n\nOur contracts with our customers are usually open-ended and can be terminated by either party without a termination penalty after the notice period has lapsed. Therefore, our contracts are defined at the transaction level and do not extend beyond the service already provided. Our contracts generally renew automatically without any significant material rights. Some of our contracts include tiered pricing, which are based primarily on volume. The fee charged per transaction is adjusted up or down if the volume processed for a specified period is different from prior period defined volumes.  We have concluded that this volume-based pricing approach does not constitute a future material right since the discount is within a range typically offered to a class of customers with similar volume. We do not have any capitalized contract costs.\n\nOur primary service comprises a single performance obligation to complete payments on our payments platform for our customers. Using our risk assessment tools, we perform a transaction risk assessment on individual transactions to determine whether a transaction should be authorized for completion on our payments platform. When we authorize a transaction, we become obligated to our customer to complete the payment transaction.\n\nWe recognize fees charged to our customers primarily on a gross basis as transaction revenue when we are the principal in respect of completing a payment transaction. As a principal to the transaction, we control the service of completing payments on our payments platform. We bear primary responsibility for the fulfillment of the payment service, contract directly with our customers, control the product specifications, and define the value proposal from our services. Further, we have full discretion in determining the fee charged to our customers, which is independent of the costs we incur in instances where we may utilize payment processors or other financial institutions to perform services on our behalf. We therefore bear full margin risk when completing a payment transaction. These fees paid to payment processors and other financial institutions are recognized as transaction expense. We are also responsible for providing customer support.",

      "question": "How did American Express's exposure to credit risk in its Card Member Loans evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to troubled debt restructurings (TDRs), cobrand partner dependencies, and modifications offered to borrowers?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express reported $3,361 million in total impaired Card Member Loans, with $596 million reserved for credit losses on TDRs, indicating significant exposure to credit risk. In 2023, the company faced growing credit risk due to its reliance on cobrand partner relationships, with 36% of global Card Member Loans tied to cobrand portfolios, and the risk of losing these loans upon contract expiration or renegotiation. By 2024, American Express disclosed that modifications to Card Member Loans did not include payment term extensions, implying a tightening of credit relief policies, which may have affected delinquency trends and credit loss provisions. The evolution suggests a shift from active loan modification and reserve building in 2022, to strategic exposure management through partner relationships in 2023, and a more restrictive modification policy by 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, AXP reported $127 million in outstanding balances from Card Member Loans that were part of Troubled Debt Restructurings that subsequently defaulted. By 2023, the total 90+ days past due category for Card Member Loans stood at $73 million, and in 2024, it increased to $89 million. This indicates that while delinquencies decreased from 2022 to 2023, they rose again in 2024, showing a volatile but still elevated credit risk profile compared to the post-default balances in 2022.",

      "question": "How did American Express's credit risk exposure related to Card Member Loans evolve from 2022 to 2024, considering delinquency levels, partner concentration risk, and securitization activity across this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express reported $226 million in over 90 days past due and accruing interest Card Member Loans, with $176 million in non-accruals and $3,918 million total impaired balance. In 2023, the company faced increasing partner concentration risk, with cobrand portfolios accounting for approximately 36% of worldwide Card Member Loans, creating dependency on key partners like Delta and Marriott. By 2024, American Express actively used securitization as a risk management tool, transferring $49.7 billion in Card Member loans and receivables to trusts to issue asset-backed securities. This evolution shows a strategic shift from primarily managing delinquencies to addressing concentration risks through partnership management and then mitigating overall credit exposure through structured finance techniques.",

Our short-term funding programs are used primarily to fund working capital needs, such as managing seasonal variations in receivables balances. The amount of short-term borrowings issued in the future will depend on our funding strategy, our needs and market conditions. We had no commercial paper outstanding at any point during 2024. Refer to Note 8 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these borrowings.\n\n## LONG-TERM DEBT AND ASSET SECURITIZATION PROGRAMS\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had $49.7 billion in long-term debt outstanding, including unsecured debt and asset-backed securities. Refer to Note 8 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of these borrowings and scheduled maturities of long-term debt obligations.\n\nWe periodically securitize Card Member loans and receivables arising from our U.S. card business, as the securitization market provides us with cost-effective funding. Securitization of Card Member loans and receivables is accomplished through the transfer of those assets to a trust, which in turn issues securities collateralized by the transferred assets to third-party investors. The proceeds from issuance are distributed to us, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, as consideration for the transferred assets. Refer to Note 5 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for a further description of our asset securitizations.\n\n## TABLE 21: DEBT ISSUANCES\n\n",

      "question": "How did the composition and risk profile of AXP's Card Member Loans evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of delinquencies, partner-related exposures, and loan modification programs?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, AXP's Card Member Loans showed a shift in both risk exposure and loan management strategies. In 2022, the company reported $3,361 million in total impaired Card Member Loans, with $596 million reserved for credit losses. By 2023, AXP highlighted growing exposure through co-brand partner relationships, with 36% of global Card Member Loans tied to co-brand portfolios, increasing vulnerability to partner renegotiations or terminations. In 2024, AXP reported $157 million in total loan modifications, including $128 million in interest rate reductions for consumer and small business loans, indicating increased efforts to manage delinquencies through proactive modifications. This evolution suggests a shift from a primarily delinquency-focused risk in 2022 to a more complex exposure involving partner dynamics in 2023 and a more active loan modification strategy in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, American Express reported $149 million in Card Member Loans over 90 days past due and accruing interest, with $1,936 million in total impaired balances across both consumer and commercial segments. By 2023, the company faced growing concentration risk as cobrand partner relationships accounted for 36% of worldwide Card Member Loans, exposing AXP to renegotiation risks and potential loan buyouts upon contract expiration. In 2024, AXP continued to value these loans using discounted cash flow models due to the lack of observable market pricing, signaling ongoing complexity in managing credit risk. The evolution shows a shift from internal delinquency tracking to external dependency risk and consistent reliance on internal valuation models.",

For these assets, the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate.\n\n## Financial Assets Carried At Other Than Fair Value\n\n## Card Member and Other loans, less reserves\n\nCard Member and Other loans are recorded at historical cost, less reserves, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In estimating the fair value for our loans, we use a discounted cash flow model. Due to the lack of a comparable whole loan sales market for similar loans and the lack of observable pricing inputs thereof, we use various inputs to estimate fair value. Such inputs include projected income, discount rates and forecasted write-offs. The valuation does not include economic value attributable to future receivables generated by the accounts associated with the loans.\n\n## Card Member loans HFS\n\nThe fair value of Card Member loans HFS is generally determined on an aggregate portfolio basis, using similar methodologies and inputs as those used for estimating the fair value of Card Member loans not HFS, as described above.\n\n## Financial Liabilities For Which Carrying Values E qual Or Approximate Fair Value\n\nFinancial liabilities for which carrying values equal or approx imate fair value include accrued interest, customer deposits (ex cluding certificates of deposit, which are described further below), Travelers Cheques and other prepaid products outstanding, accounts payable, short-term borrowings and certain other liabilities for which the carrying values approximate fair value because they are short term in duration, have no defined maturity or have a market-based interest rate.\n\n## Financial Liabilities Carried At Other Than Fair Value\n\n## Certificates of Deposit\n\nCertificates of deposit (CDs) are recorded at their historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow methodology based on the future cash flows and the discount rate that reflects the current market rates for similar types of CDs within similar markets.\n\n## Long-term Debt\n\nLong-term debt is recorded at historical issuance cost on the Consolidated Balance Sheets adjusted for (i) unamortized discount and unamortized fees, (ii) the impact of movements in exchange rates on foreign currency denominated debt and (iii) the impact of fair value hedge accounting on certain fixed-rate notes that have been swapped to floating rate through the use of interest rate swaps. The fair value of our long-term debt is measured using quoted offer prices when quoted market prices are available. If quoted market prices are not available, the fair value is determined by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently observed in publicly-traded debt markets for debt of similar terms and credit risk. For long-term debt, where there are no rates currently observable in publicly traded debt markets of similar terms and comparable credit risk, we use market interest rates and adjust those rates for necessary risks, including our own credit risk. In determining an appropriate spread to reflect our credit standing, we consider credit default swap spreads, bond yields of other long-term debt offered by us, and interest rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities.\n\n## NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\n\nWe have certain assets that are subject to measurement at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. For these assets, measurement at fair value in periods subsequent to their initial recognition is applicable if they are determined to be impaired or where there are observable price changes for equity investments without readily determinable fair values.",

      "question": "How did PayPal's allowance for consumer loans evolve from 2022 through 2024 as the outstanding balance of consumer receivables fluctuated, and what does this trend indicate about the company's credit risk exposure over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal reported an outstanding balance of $3.8 billion in consumer receivables as of December 31, 2021, with a corresponding allowance for consumer loans determined through internally developed risk models and delinquency trends. By 2023, the outstanding balance had increased to $4.8 billion as of December 31, 2023, reflecting growth in credit products offered, including interest-bearing installment loans in the U.S. and Germany, while also purchasing $670 million in consumer receivables during the year. In 2024, PayPal provided a summary of the activity in the allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable, indicating continued monitoring and adjustments to the allowance in response to credit risk exposure. The increase in outstanding receivables from 2022 to 2023, followed by a detailed summary of allowance activity in 2024, suggests a rising credit risk exposure that PayPal actively managed through dynamic adjustments to its allowance, reflecting a transforming trend in credit risk management over the three-year period.",

Our revolving credit product consists of PayPal Credit in the U.K. Once a consumer is approved for credit, it is made available to them as a funding source. Additionally, we offer installment credit products (known as buy now, pay later) at the time of checkout in various locations including the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Japan. The majority of the installment loans allow consumers to pay for a product over periods of 12 months or less. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding balance of consumer receivables, which consisted of revolving and installment loans and interest receivable, was $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.\n\nWe closely monitor the credit quality of our consumer receivables to evaluate and manage our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins with initial underwriting and continues through to full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal historical experience, including the consumer's prior repayment history with our credit products where available. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our models, to plan our collection practices and strategies, and in determining our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable.\n\nThe following tables present the delinquency status of consumer loans and interest receivable by year of origination. The amounts are based on the number of days past the billing date for revolving loans or contractual repayment date for installment loans. The 'current' category represents balances that are within 29 days of the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable.\n\n",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's merchant loan delinquency and charge-off trends reveal a significant tightening in risk exposure. In 2022, gross charge-offs totaled $42 million, a decrease from $8 million in 2020 but still reflecting pandemic-era impacts. By 2023, charge-offs spiked to $96 million, indicating increased stress in the loan portfolio, possibly due to economic pressures or loosened underwriting standards. However, in 2024, total gross charge-offs for the year were $10 million, a dramatic drop, suggesting improved credit quality or tighter lending criteria. Additionally, delinquency data from 2024 shows that 90.4% of merchant loans were current, with only 0.4% over 180 days delinquent, indicating a much healthier portfolio compared to earlier years. This 3-year evolution suggests PayPal may have recalibrated its merchant lending strategy, leading to a more resilient portfolio by 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\nThe  decrease  in  the  charge-offs  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  compared  to  2020  was  due  to  improved  portfolio performance. Additionally, charge offs increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to accounts that experienced financial difficulties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor  merchant  loans  and  advances,  the  determination  of  delinquency  is  based  on  the  current  expected  or  contractual  repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days, or when the repayments are 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days  of  receiving  notification  of  bankruptcy.  The  provision  for  credit  losses  on  merchant  loans  and  advances  is  recognized  in transaction and credit losses, and the provision for interest and fees receivable is recognized as a reduction of deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable.\n\n## Troubled debt restructurings\n\nIn instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we will be unable to collect all amounts due. These modifications are intended to provide merchants with financial relief, and help enable us to mitigate losses.\n\nThese modifications include an increase in term by approximately 1 to 5.5 years while moving the delinquency status to current. The fee on certain of these loans or advances remains unchanged over the extended term. Alternatively, certain loans and advances have been modified to replace the initial  fixed  fee  structure  at  the  time  the  loan  or  advance  was  extended  with  a  fixed  annual percentage rate applied over the amended remaining term, which will continue to accrue interest at the fixed rate until the earlier of maturity or charge-off. These modifications had a de minimis impact on our consolidated statements of income in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nAllowances for TDRs are assessed separately from other loans and advances within our portfolio and are determined by estimating current  expected  credit  losses  utilizing  the  modified  term  and  interest  rate  assumptions.  Historical  loss  estimates  are  utilized  in addition to macroeconomic assumptions to determine expected credit loss rates. Further, we may include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses.\n\nThe following tables  show  the  merchant  loans  and  interest  receivables  which  have  been  modified  as TDRs  in  the  years  ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, PYPL reported a beginning balance of $322 million for consumer loans receivable allowance, with $292 million in provisions, $216 million in charge-offs, and ending at $357 million. In 2023, the beginning balance was $357 million, with higher provisions of $342 million but also higher charge-offs at $342 million, ending at $357 million again. In 2024, the beginning balance remained at $357 million, but provisions dropped to $249 million, charge-offs were $301 million, and the ending balance declined to $341 million. This shows a trend of increasing credit stress in 2023 followed by a slight moderation in 2024, with provisions peaking in 2023 and declining in 2024, while charge-offs remained high, indicating ongoing challenges in consumer loan performance.",

Allowances for our merchant and consumer portfolios included qualitative adjustments which took into account continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic conditions, as well as uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrowers, including uncertainty  around  the  effectiveness  of  loan  modification  programs  made  available  to  merchants.  The  credit  losses  in  the  year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily associated with an increase in provisions for our loans receivable portfolio resulting from a reserve build driven by a sharp deterioration in macroeconomic projections reflecting the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and provisions associated with originations, both of which significantly increased our then current expected credit losses, and  to  a  lesser  extent,  changes  in  credit  quality  during  the  period.  The  increase  in  provisions  associated  with  macroeconomic projections in the year ended December 31, 2020 included qualitative adjustments to account for the impact of limitations in our expected credit loss models resulting from the extreme fluctuations in both the actual and projected macroeconomic conditions during  the  period  as  well  as  to  incorporate  varying  degrees  of  merchant  performance  in  the  current  environment  and  expected performance in future periods.\n\nThe  consumer  loans  and  interest  receivable  balance  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020  was  $3.8  billion  and  $2.2  billion, respectively,  representing  a  year-over-year  increase  of  77%  driven  by  growth  of  our  installment  credit  products  in  international markets and the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, growth of PayPal Credit in international markets. Approximately 53% and 77% of our consumer loans receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were due from consumers in the U.K. The decline in the percentage of consumer loans receivable outstanding in the U.K. at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was due to overall growth in the consumer loan portfolio, particularly from installment credit products in other markets.\n\nThe following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance:\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal used a 2-year reasonable and supportable forecast period for its revolving consumer credit products. In 2023, this forecast period was significantly extended to approximately 5 years. By 2024, the forecast period remained at around 5 years, indicating a sustained strategic shift toward incorporating longer-term macroeconomic trends into credit risk modeling. This evolution reflects PayPal's increasing emphasis on macroeconomic sensitivity and forward-looking credit loss estimation for its consumer loan portfolio.",

Our revolving credit product consists of PayPal Credit in the U.K. Once a consumer is approved for credit, it is made available to them as a funding source. Additionally, we offer installment credit products (known as buy now, pay later) at the time of checkout in various locations including the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Japan. The majority of the installment loans allow consumers to pay for a product over periods of 12 months or less. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding balance of consumer receivables, which consisted of revolving and installment loans and interest receivable, was $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.\n\nWe closely monitor the credit quality of our consumer receivables to evaluate and manage our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins with initial underwriting and continues through to full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal historical experience, including the consumer's prior repayment history with our credit products where available. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our models, to plan our collection practices and strategies, and in determining our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable.\n\nThe following tables present the delinquency status of consumer loans and interest receivable by year of origination. The amounts are based on the number of days past the billing date for revolving loans or contractual repayment date for installment loans. The 'current' category represents balances that are within 29 days of the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\nThe allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable not classified as held for sale is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data and incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. For both 2024 and 2023, the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products and installment products (not classified as held for sale) that we have included in our projected loss rates, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, was approximately 5 years and 7 months to 3.5 years, respectively. Projected loss rates (inclusive of historical loss data and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors) are derived based on and applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses, such as expectations of macroeconomic conditions not captured in the loss models for our installment products (not classified as held for sale). The allowance for current ex pected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors.\n\nWe charge off consumer receivable balances in the month in which a customer's balance becomes 180 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date, except for the U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment receivables, which are charged off 120 days past the contractual repayment date. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable. Loans receivable continue to accrue interest until they are charged off.\n\nIn  connection  with  the  sale  of  our  eligible  consumer  installment  receivables  and  the  reclassification  of  that  portfolio  as  held  for  sale  in  2023,  we  reversed  the previously recorded allowances for credit losses associated with those loans and interest receivable balances. Charge-offs and any adjustments to the fair value of loans and interest receivable, held for sale, are recorded in restructuring and other on our consolidated statement of income (loss).\n\nThe allowance for merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. In the third quarter of 2024, we updated our expected credit loss model for our PPWC portfolio to reflect its current risk characteristics. These changes did not have a material impact on our provision recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024. The merchant loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, first borrowing versus repeat borrowing, delinquency, internally developed risk ratings, and vintage, as well as macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment rates and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates for 2024 and 2023, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, was approximately 2.5 to 3.5 years. Projected loss rates, inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are derived based on and applied to the principal amount of our merchant receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses. The allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors.\n\nFor merchant loans and advances, the determination of delinquency is based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance and fix ed  interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days, or when the repayments are 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment in the last 60 days. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable.\n\n68",

      "question": "How did BNY Mellon's exposure to credit rating-related risks affecting its financial condition evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does this progression indicate about the company's sensitivity to external credit assessments?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, BNY Mellon consistently highlighted that a material reduction in its or its subsidiaries' credit ratings could increase funding and borrowing costs, adversely affecting its business and financial condition. In 2022, the risk was tied broadly to 'The Bank of New York Mellon or BNY Mellon, N.A.' In 2023, the disclosure expanded to include additional subsidiaries: 'The Bank of New York Mellon SA/NV' as specific entities whose credit ratings could impact the parent company. By 2024, the company further emphasized the material adverse effect of rating reductions on its financial condition and explicitly linked this risk to its securities' value. This evolution indicates that BNY Mellon's sensitivity to external credit assessments remained a persistent risk factor but was increasingly tied to a broader set of rated entities and more explicitly to the financial consequences for the parent company and its investors.",

      "question": "How did the assets under management (AUM) within BNY Mellon's Investment and Wealth Management segment evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the segment's strategic positioning and client demand over time?",
      "answer": "BNY Mellon's assets under management (AUM) in the Investment and Wealth Management segment were $2.4 trillion as of December 31, 2021 (reported in the 2022 10-K), declined to $2.0 trillion as of December 31, 2023 (reported in the 2023 10-K), and remained flat at $2.0 trillion as of December 31, 2024 (reported in the 2024 10-K). This represents a 16.7% decrease from 2021 to 2023, followed by stability in 2024. The decline may reflect market volatility or asset reallocations during that period, while the stabilization in 2024 could indicate improved client retention or market recovery. The consistent segment structure across all three years suggests a maintained strategic focus on Investment and Wealth Management despite the fluctuation in AUM.",

With its subsidiaries, BNY Mellon has been in business since 1784.\n\nWe previously divided our businesses into two business segments, Investment Services and Investment and Wealth Management. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we disaggregated our Investment Services business segment into two new business segments, Securities Services and Market and Wealth Services. Our Investment and Wealth Management business segment was not impacted by this resegmentation. We also have an Other segment, which includes the leasing portfolio, corporate treasury activities (including our securities portfolio), derivatives and other trading activity, corporate and bank-owned life insurance, renewable energy and other corporate investments and certain business exits.\n\nFor a further discussion of BNY Mellon's lines of business, products and services, see the 'Overview,' 'Summary of financial highlights,' 'Fee and other revenue,' 'Review of business segments' and 'International operations' sections in the MD&amp;A section in the Annual Report and Notes 24 and 25 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Annual Report, of which portions are incorporated herein by reference.

Most of our Investment Management business and Pershing businesses are direct or indirect non-bank subsidiaries of BNY Mellon.\n\nEach of our bank and trust company subsidiaries is subject to regulation by the applicable bank regulatory authority. The deposits of our U.S. banking subsidiaries are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to the extent provided by law.\n\nBNY Mellon's banking subsidiaries outside the United States are subject to regulation by non-U.S. regulatory authorities in addition to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the 'Federal Reserve').

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\n\n## We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we work with partners such as Delta, Hilton, Marriott and British Airways to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and with partners in many industries, including Delta, to offer benefits and rewards to Card Members. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fix ed period unless ex tended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. Additionally, partners may make changes to the products and services they offer or otherwise become less desirable to our customers, which may lower the value of our products, such as the cobranded cards we issue to our customers. We may also choose not to renew certain cobrand relationships. Billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to such cobranded card portfolio, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ' above for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\n\n## Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and outages, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. For example, our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. For example, the operational rights relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business are owned by a business partner and the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions and compliance issues that impacted the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended, terminated or otherwise experience further issues in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers' ex perience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. We also face the risk that ex isting relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our",

The trust, in turn, issues securities, commonly referred to as asset-backed securities that are secured by the transferred loans and receivables. The trust uses the proceeds from the sale of such securities to pay the purchase price for the transferred loans or receivables. The securitized loans and receivables of our Lending Trust and Charge Trust (collectively, the Trusts) are reported as assets and the securities issued by the Trusts are reported as liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nAverage discount rate This calculation is generally designed to reflect the average pricing at all merchants accepting American Express cards and represents the percentage of network volumes retained by us from spend at merchants we acquire, or from merchants acquired by third parties on our behalf, net of amounts retained by such third parties. The average discount rate, together with network volumes, drive our discount revenue.\n\nBilled business - Represents transaction volumes (including cash advances) on cards and other payment products issued by American Express. Billed business is reported as inside the United States or outside the United States based on the location of the issuer.\n\nCapital ratios - Represents the minimum standards established by regulatory agencies as a measure to determine whether the regulated entity has sufficient capital to absorb on- and off-balance sheet losses beyond current loss accrual estimates. Refer to the Capital Strategy section under 'Consolidated Capital Resources and Liquidity' for further related definitions under Basel III.\n\nCard Member - The individual holder of an issued American Express-branded card.\n\nCard Member loans - Represents revolve-eligible transactions on our card products, as well as any interest charges and associated card-related fees.\n\nCard Member receivables - Represents transactions on our card products and card related fees that need to be paid in full on or before the Card Member's payment due date.\n\nCards-in-force - Represents the number of cards that are issued and outstanding by American Express (proprietary cards-in-force) and cards issued and outstanding under network partnership agreements with banks and other institutions, including joint ventures (GNS cards-in-force), except for GNS retail cobrand cards that had no out-of-store spending activity during the prior twelve months. Basic cards-in-force excludes supplemental cards issued on consumer accounts. Cards-in-force is useful in understanding the size of our Card Member base.\n\nCharge cards - Represents cards that generally carry no pre-set spending limits and are primarily designed as a method of payment and not as a means of financing purchases. Each charge card transaction is authorized based on its likely economics reflecting a Card Member's most recent credit information and spend patterns. Charge Card Members must pay the full amount of balances billed each month, with the exception of balances that can be revolved under lending features offered on certain charge cards, such as Pay Over Time and Plan It, that allow Card Members to pay for eligible purchases with interest over time.\n\nCobrand cards - Cards issued under cobrand agreements with selected commercial partners. Pursuant to the cobrand agreements, we make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The partner is then liable for providing rewards to the Card Member under the cobrand partner's own loyalty program.\n\nCredit cards - Represents cards that have a range of revolving payment terms, structured payment features (e.g. Plan It), grace periods, and rate and fee structures.\n\nDiscount revenue - Primarily represents the amount earned on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, a GNS partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members.",

      "question": "How did the treatment and risk profile of American Express's Membership Rewards liability evolve from 2022 through 2024, particularly in terms of accounting assumptions, model risk, and potential financial impact?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, American Express's treatment of the Membership Rewards liability remained a significant accounting estimate based on management's assumptions about future events, but the risk profile associated with it increased due to growing model complexity and regulatory scrutiny. In 2022, the liability was described as a key component of Other fees and commissions, with fees deferred and recognized over the membership period. By 2023, the liability was again highlighted as a major accounting estimate, but the discussion expanded to include its role in the broader context of revenue recognition and contract obligations. In 2024, the liability was explicitly tied to model risk, with a focus on the use of forward-looking assumptions and the increasing complexity of models, particularly those incorporating artificial intelligence, which introduced new risks of bias, inaccuracy, and interpretability challenges. This evolution indicates a growing emphasis on the liability\u2019s sensitivity to modeling assumptions and its potential to materially affect financial results.",

Furthermore, given intellectual property ownership and license rights surrounding artificial intelligence, such as generative artificial intelligence, are currently not fully addressed by courts or regulators, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against infringing use and our use or adoption of artificial intelligence may result in ex posure to claims by third parties.\n\n## Tax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex, require significant judgment and are subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, they are subject to challenge by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations, which could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. Refer to Note 20 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for information on the U.S. federal income tax audit of transfer pricing arrangements between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWe are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax  authorities may determine that we owe additional tax es or apply ex isting laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for tax es and interest in ex cess of accrued liabilities.\n\nLegislative action or inaction in the countries in which we have operations could increase our effective tax rate. For ex ample, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will impact how multinational enterprises (MNEs) are taxed on their global profits. In particular, the OECD's guidelines on a global minimum tax of 15 percent will impact the effective tax rate for many MNEs. Many countries have already implemented these minimum tax guidelines, with effective dates commencing in 2024. We expect that these minimum tax guidelines in their current form would increase our effective tax rate in future years. Furthermore, various provisions of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act will expire in 2025 unless extended. As a result, U.S. Congress may seek to enact significant tax legislation in the new session of Congress, which could result in higher levels of U.S. tax  on our global operations, increasing our effective tax  rate.\n\nJurisdictions may also make changes related to the tax treatment of card transactions, such as imposing taxes on Card Member rewards or prohibiting interchange fees on sales tax, which could decrease the value we provide to customers and adversely impact our business.\n\n## Our operations, business, customers and partners could be adversely affected by climate-related risks.\n\nThere are increasing and rapidly evolving concerns over climate-related risks and related environmental sustainability and recovery matters. We face physical risks related to climate, including rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of ex treme weather events and natural disasters. Such events and disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties on which we rely and could result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers' spending behaviors or ability to pay outstanding loans. Additionally, we may face risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences, travel patterns and legal requirements could impact our revenues or expenses or otherwise adversely affect our business, our customers and partners.\n\nWe may not be able to effectively identify, measure or control our exposure to climate-related risks, particularly given that the timing, nature and severity of the impacts of these risks may not be predictable. We could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of our climate-related initiatives and goals. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these goals, which depend in part on third-party performance, data that is outside of our control and methodologies that may evolve over time. We could be required to change our business, management practices and partnerships, incur expenses from changes to our technology, operations, products and services, and experience reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced stakeholder confidence, due to our response or perceived lack of response to climate and environmental issues.\n\n## Model, Credit, Market and Funding &amp; Liquidity Risks\n\n## Our use of models to manage risk and make business decisions may not be effective.\n\nWe use models and automation throughout our business, including to inform and support decision making, manage risks and estimate financial values. Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition, issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For ex ample, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes, such as because of changes in the credit profile of our Card Members, and they may not be able to predict future outcomes. Additionally, we increasingly use models that leverage artificial intelligence, which are subject to additional risks such as biased or inaccurate results or lowered interpretability. Our models also may not be able to function properly in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment given the lack of recent precedent. Certain models, such as models for credit loss accounting under Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) and Membership Rewards liability, require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments, and utilize forward-looking information. If our business decisions or financial estimates are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

      "question": "How did American Express's billed business evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year trend reveal about the company's reliance on cobrand partnerships and the associated risks?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express reported $1,089.8 billion in billed business, reflecting a 25% increase compared to the prior year. In 2023, the company noted that this metric continued to grow, with discount revenue increasing by 17%, primarily driven by higher billed business. However, by 2024, the company highlighted that its cobrand partnerships, which accounted for approximately 25% of worldwide billed business, posed a material risk due to the competitive landscape and potential renegotiations or terminations of these agreements. This trajectory indicates that while billed business has been on an upward trend, the company's increasing dependence on cobrand partnerships has introduced new vulnerabilities, particularly as competition intensifies and contractual terms become less favorable.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\n\n## We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we work with partners such as Delta, Hilton, Marriott and British Airways to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and with partners in many industries, including Delta, to offer benefits and rewards to Card Members. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fix ed period unless ex tended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. Additionally, partners may make changes to the products and services they offer or otherwise become less desirable to our customers, which may lower the value of our products, such as the cobranded cards we issue to our customers. We may also choose not to renew certain cobrand relationships. Billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to such cobranded card portfolio, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ' above for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\n\n## Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and outages, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. For example, our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. For example, the operational rights relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business are owned by a business partner and the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions and compliance issues that impacted the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended, terminated or otherwise experience further issues in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers' ex perience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. We also face the risk that ex isting relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our",

      "question": "How did American Express's billed business evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in relation to its cobrand partnership strategy, and what does this progression reveal about the company's reliance on these partnerships for transaction volume growth?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express reported that billed business increased 25% year-over-year and represented 85% of total network volumes, with U.S. spend rising 26% and exceeding 2019 levels. This growth was driven by strong performance across consumer and small business segments. By 2024, cobrand partnerships had become even more central to the company's strategy, with cobrand portfolios accounting for approximately 25% of worldwide billed business. The growing reliance on these partnerships was evident in the increasing payments made to cobrand partners based on Card Member spending, particularly in the U.S., where competition for such relationships intensified. This trajectory shows a strategic shift toward greater dependence on cobrand arrangements\u2014especially with partners like Delta and Hilton\u2014to sustain billed business growth, even as it exposed AXP to risks related to renegotiation, loss of exclusivity, and higher partner payments. The evolution from a broad-based volume recovery in 2022 to a more partnership-dependent growth model by 2024 highlights the dual-edged nature of this strategic emphasis.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\n\n## We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we work with partners such as Delta, Hilton, Marriott and British Airways to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and with partners in many industries, including Delta, to offer benefits and rewards to Card Members. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fix ed period unless ex tended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. Additionally, partners may make changes to the products and services they offer or otherwise become less desirable to our customers, which may lower the value of our products, such as the cobranded cards we issue to our customers. We may also choose not to renew certain cobrand relationships. Billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to such cobranded card portfolio, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ' above for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\n\n## Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and outages, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. For example, our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. For example, the operational rights relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business are owned by a business partner and the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions and compliance issues that impacted the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended, terminated or otherwise experience further issues in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers' ex perience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. We also face the risk that ex isting relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our",

Net income more than doubled versus the prior year to $8.1 billion and exceeded 2019 levels; contributing to this increase in Net income in the current year was a $2.5 billion credit reserve release and sizeable net gains on equity investments.\n\nYear-over-year comparisons reflect the adverse impacts on our business in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As certain of the pandemic-related restrictions were lifted and macroeconomic conditions improved, and through the successful execution of our investment strategy, we saw a steady recovery in our business, with certain key areas growing beyond pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2021.\n\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 24 percent compared to the prior year and reached 2019 levels. Billed business, which represented 85 percent of our total network volumes and drives most of our financial results, increased 25 percent and continued to show different paces of recovery for G&amp;S and T&amp;E spend. G&amp;S spend, which accounts for the majority of our billed business, grew by 19 percent on a year-over-year basis, and was 18 percent above 2019 levels. This growth was primarily driven by ongoing strong performance in online and card-not-present spending even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth compared to 2019 levels. Global T&amp;E spend grew 59 percent versus the prior year, reflecting a steady recovery throughout the year, which resulted in fourth quarter T&amp;E volumes reaching 82 percent of 2019 levels. The year-over-year growth in billed business was led by the U.S., where spend increased 26 percent versus the prior year and exceeded 2019 levels by 6 percent, primarily driven by U.S. consumers and small and mid-sized enterprises.\n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 17 percent year-over-year, reflecting double digit growth in all our non-interest revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 26 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in Card Member spending. Other fees and commissions and Other revenues increased year-over-year, primarily driven by higher travelrelated revenues. Net card fees grew consistently throughout 2021 and were up 11 percent year over year, as new card acquisitions increased, and Card Member retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Net interest income declined 3 percent versus the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances.\n\nCard Member loans increased 21 percent, which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates driven in part by the continued liquidity and financial strength of our customer base. Provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, primarily due to a $2.5 billion reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the prior year and lower net write-offs in the current year. The reserve release in the current year was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables. We do not expect to see reserve releases of this magnitude in 2022.\n\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage, and increased year-over-year due to growth in spend and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Additionally, our higher rewards expense versus last year was partially driven by an increase to our Membership Rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. During the year we increased marketing investments to build growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Our ongoing investments in differentiated value propositions and expansion of our digital capabilities are helping to drive increased Card Member engagement and strong retention rates. Our operating expenses for 2021 were in line with 2020; however, the current year included sizeable net gains associated with the Amex Ventures equity investments that we do not expect to occur with the same magnitude in 2022. We expect to continue to invest strategically in marketing, value propositions on our products, technology and our colleagues.",

      "question": "How did American Express's liability for Membership Rewards evolve from 2022 to 2024, and what does the trajectory of changes in Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) and Weighted Average Cost (WAC) per point reveal about the company's risk exposure and expense management in its loyalty program?",
      "answer": "In 2022, American Express disclosed that a 25-basis-point increase in the URR would raise the Membership Rewards liability by $140 million, and a 1-basis-point increase in WAC per point would increase the liability by $168 million. In 2023, the company refined its estimation methodology, emphasizing the use of statistical and actuarial models to project URR based on redemption trends, card product type, and credit attributes, while WAC per point was derived from 12 months of redemptions and adjusted for cost expectations. By 2024, the company flagged increasing model risk, noting that Membership Rewards liability estimation required complex forward-looking assumptions and was vulnerable to errors or misjudgments, which could materially impact financial results. This progression shows rising complexity and risk exposure tied to the loyalty program, with increasing reliance on predictive modeling and sensitivity to redemption behavior and cost assumptions.",

Furthermore, given intellectual property ownership and license rights surrounding artificial intelligence, such as generative artificial intelligence, are currently not fully addressed by courts or regulators, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against infringing use and our use or adoption of artificial intelligence may result in ex posure to claims by third parties.\n\n## Tax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex, require significant judgment and are subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, they are subject to challenge by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations, which could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. Refer to Note 20 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for information on the U.S. federal income tax audit of transfer pricing arrangements between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWe are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax  authorities may determine that we owe additional tax es or apply ex isting laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for tax es and interest in ex cess of accrued liabilities.\n\nLegislative action or inaction in the countries in which we have operations could increase our effective tax rate. For ex ample, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will impact how multinational enterprises (MNEs) are taxed on their global profits. In particular, the OECD's guidelines on a global minimum tax of 15 percent will impact the effective tax rate for many MNEs. Many countries have already implemented these minimum tax guidelines, with effective dates commencing in 2024. We expect that these minimum tax guidelines in their current form would increase our effective tax rate in future years. Furthermore, various provisions of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act will expire in 2025 unless extended. As a result, U.S. Congress may seek to enact significant tax legislation in the new session of Congress, which could result in higher levels of U.S. tax  on our global operations, increasing our effective tax  rate.\n\nJurisdictions may also make changes related to the tax treatment of card transactions, such as imposing taxes on Card Member rewards or prohibiting interchange fees on sales tax, which could decrease the value we provide to customers and adversely impact our business.\n\n## Our operations, business, customers and partners could be adversely affected by climate-related risks.\n\nThere are increasing and rapidly evolving concerns over climate-related risks and related environmental sustainability and recovery matters. We face physical risks related to climate, including rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of ex treme weather events and natural disasters. Such events and disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties on which we rely and could result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers' spending behaviors or ability to pay outstanding loans. Additionally, we may face risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences, travel patterns and legal requirements could impact our revenues or expenses or otherwise adversely affect our business, our customers and partners.\n\nWe may not be able to effectively identify, measure or control our exposure to climate-related risks, particularly given that the timing, nature and severity of the impacts of these risks may not be predictable. We could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of our climate-related initiatives and goals. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these goals, which depend in part on third-party performance, data that is outside of our control and methodologies that may evolve over time. We could be required to change our business, management practices and partnerships, incur expenses from changes to our technology, operations, products and services, and experience reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced stakeholder confidence, due to our response or perceived lack of response to climate and environmental issues.\n\n## Model, Credit, Market and Funding &amp; Liquidity Risks\n\n## Our use of models to manage risk and make business decisions may not be effective.\n\nWe use models and automation throughout our business, including to inform and support decision making, manage risks and estimate financial values. Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition, issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For ex ample, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes, such as because of changes in the credit profile of our Card Members, and they may not be able to predict future outcomes. Additionally, we increasingly use models that leverage artificial intelligence, which are subject to additional risks such as biased or inaccurate results or lowered interpretability. Our models also may not be able to function properly in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment given the lack of recent precedent. Certain models, such as models for credit loss accounting under Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) and Membership Rewards liability, require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments, and utilize forward-looking information. If our business decisions or financial estimates are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.",

Card Members can earn points for purchases charged on their enrolled card products. A significant portion of our cards, by their terms, allow Card Members to earn bonus points for purchases at merchants in particular industry categories. Membership Rewards points are redeemable for a broad variety of rewards, including travel, shopping, gift cards, and covering eligible charges. Points typically do not expire, and there is no limit on the number of points a Card Member may earn. Membership Rewards expense is driven by charge volume on enrolled cards, customer participation in the program and contractual arrangements with redemption partners.\n\nWe record a Membership Rewards liability that represents our best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The Membership Rewards liability is impacted over time by enrollment levels, attrition, the volume of points earned and redeemed, and the associated redemption costs. We estimate the Membership Rewards liability by determining the URR and the weighted average cost (WAC) per point, which are applied to the points of current enrollees. Refer to Note 9 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for additional information.\n\nThe URR assumption is used to estimate the number of points earned by current enrollees that will ultimately be redeemed in future periods. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR of points earned to date by current Card Members based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is used to estimate future redemption costs and is primarily based on redemption choices made by Card Members, reward offerings by partners, and Membership Rewards program changes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\n\nWe periodically evaluate our liability estimation process and assumptions based on developments in redemption patterns, cost per point redeemed, partner contract changes and other factors.\n\nThe process of estimating the Membership Rewards liability includes a high degree of judgment. Actual redemptions and associated redemption costs could differ significantly from our estimates, resulting in either higher or lower Membership Rewards expense.\n\nChanges in the Membership Rewards URR and WAC per point have the effect of either increasing or decreasing the liability through the current period Membership Rewards expense by an amount estimated to cover the cost of all points previously earned but not yet redeemed by current enrollees as of the end of the reporting period. As of December 31, 2021, an increase in the estimated URR of current enrollees of 25 basis points would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $140 million. Similarly, an increase in the WAC per point of 1 basis point would increase the Membership Rewards liability and corresponding rewards expense by approximately $168 million.",

In 2024, co-branded card partnerships accounted for approximately 25% of worldwide billed business, but the company highlighted increasing risks, including the potential loss or renegotiation of these partnerships, which could lead to significant declines in billed business and card member attrition.

Within processed volumes we now include transactions associated with certain alternative payment solutions that were not previously reported in our volume metrics. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform with current period presentation. Refer to the 'Glossary of Selected Terminology' for definitions of each updated term.\n\n## NON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.\n\n## BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\nOur results for the year reflect the strong growth momentum we have seen in our business throughout 2021, and our strategy of investing in our customers, brand and talent is helping in our effort to drive share, scale and relevance. Spending on our network reached record levels and credit metrics remained around historic lows. Net income more than doubled versus the prior year to $8.1 billion and exceeded 2019 levels; contributing to this increase in Net income in the current year was a $2.5 billion credit reserve release and sizeable net gains on equity investments.\n\nYear-over-year comparisons reflect the adverse impacts on our business in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As certain of the pandemic-related restrictions were lifted and macroeconomic conditions improved, and through the successful execution of our investment strategy, we saw a steady recovery in our business, with certain key areas growing beyond pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2021.\n\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 24 percent compared to the prior year and reached 2019 levels. Billed business, which represented 85 percent of our total network volumes and drives most of our financial results, increased 25 percent and continued to show different paces of recovery for G&amp;S and T&amp;E spend. G&amp;S spend, which accounts for the majority of our billed business, grew by 19 percent on a year-over-year basis, and was 18 percent above 2019 levels. This growth was primarily driven by ongoing strong performance in online and card-not-present spending even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth compared to 2019 levels. Global T&amp;E spend grew 59 percent versus the prior year, reflecting a steady recovery throughout the year, which resulted in fourth quarter T&amp;E volumes reaching 82 percent of 2019 levels. The year-over-year growth in billed business was led by the U.S., where spend increased 26 percent versus the prior year and exceeded 2019 levels by 6 percent, primarily driven by U.S. consumers and small and mid-sized enterprises.\n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 17 percent year-over-year, reflecting double digit growth in all our non-interest revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 26 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in Card Member spending. Other fees and commissions and Other revenues increased year-over-year, primarily driven by higher travelrelated revenues. Net card fees grew consistently throughout 2021 and were up 11 percent year over year, as new card acquisitions increased, and Card Member retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Net interest income declined 3 percent versus the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances.\n\nCard Member loans increased 21 percent, which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates driven in part by the continued liquidity and financial strength of our customer base. Provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, primarily due to a $2.5 billion reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the prior year and lower net write-offs in the current year. The reserve release in the current year was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables. We do not expect to see reserve releases of this magnitude in 2022.\n\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage, and increased year-over-year due to growth in spend and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Additionally, our higher rewards expense versus last year was partially driven by an increase to our Membership Rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. During the year we increased marketing investments to build growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Our ongoing investments in differentiated value propositions and expansion of our digital capabilities are helping to drive increased Card Member engagement and strong retention rates. Our operating expenses for 2021 were in line with 2020; however, the current year included sizeable net gains associated with the Amex Ventures equity investments that we do not expect to occur with the same magnitude in 2022. We expect to continue to invest strategically in marketing, value propositions on our products, technology and our colleagues.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\n\n## We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we work with partners such as Delta, Hilton, Marriott and British Airways to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and with partners in many industries, including Delta, to offer benefits and rewards to Card Members. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fix ed period unless ex tended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. Additionally, partners may make changes to the products and services they offer or otherwise become less desirable to our customers, which may lower the value of our products, such as the cobranded cards we issue to our customers. We may also choose not to renew certain cobrand relationships. Billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to such cobranded card portfolio, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ' above for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\n\n## Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and outages, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. For example, our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. For example, the operational rights relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business are owned by a business partner and the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions and compliance issues that impacted the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended, terminated or otherwise experience further issues in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers' ex perience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. We also face the risk that ex isting relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our",

      "answer": "In 2022, AXP described the Membership Rewards liability as being based on estimates and assumptions, including redemption patterns and cost per point, which are subject to change and could significantly impact financial results. In 2023, AXP provided detailed quantitative sensitivities, stating that a 25 basis point increase in the ultimate redemption rate (URR) would increase the liability by $179 million, and a 1 basis point increase in the weighted average cost (WAC) per point would increase the liability by $201 million. In 2024, AXP highlighted that modeling risks, particularly those involving forward-looking assumptions like URR and WAC, could materially affect financial estimates and results of operations. The evolution shows increasing emphasis on the complexity and sensitivity of liability estimation, with 2023 providing concrete figures that quantify the financial exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## AMOUNTS BASED ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\n\nAccounting estimates are an integral part of the Consolidated Financial Statements. These estimates are based, in part, on management's assumptions concerning future events. Among the more significant assumptions are those that relate to reserves for Card Member credit losses on loans and receivables, Membership Rewards liability, goodwill and income taxes. These accounting estimates reflect the best judgment of management, but actual results could differ.\n\n## INCOME STATEMENT\n\n## Discount Revenue\n\nDiscount revenue primarily represents the amount we earn on transactions occurring at merchants that have entered into a card acceptance agreement with us, or a Global Network Services (GNS) partner or other third-party merchant acquirer, for facilitating transactions between the merchants and Card Members. The amount of fees charged for accepting our cards as payment for goods or services, or merchant discount, varies with, among other factors, the industry in which the merchant conducts business, the merchant's overall American Express-related transaction volume, the method of payment, the settlement terms with the merchant, the method of submission of transactions and, in certain instances, the geographic scope of the card acceptance agreement between the merchant and us (e.g., local or global) and the transaction amount. The merchant discount is generally deducted from the payment to the merchant and recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs.\n\nThe card acceptance agreements, which include the agreed-upon terms for charging the merchant discount fee, vary in duration. Our contracts with small- and medium-sized merchants generally have no fixed contractual duration, while those with large merchants are generally for fixed periods, which typically range from three to seven years in duration. Our fixed-period agreements may include auto-renewal features, which may allow the existing terms to continue beyond the stated expiration date until a new agreement is reached. We satisfy our obligations under these agreements over the contract term, often on a daily basis, including through the processing of Card Member transactions and the availability of our payment network.\n\nIn cases where the merchant acquirer is a third party (which is the case, for example, under our OptBlue program, or with certain of our GNS partners), we receive a network rate fee in our settlement with the merchant acquirer, which is individually negotiated between us and that merchant acquirer and is recorded as discount revenue at the time the Card Member transaction occurs. In our role as the operator of the American Express network, we also settle with merchants on behalf of our GNS card issuing partners, who in turn receive an issuer rate that is individually negotiated between that issuer and us and is recorded as expense in Marketing and business development (see below) or as contra-revenue in Other revenue.\n\nRevenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to contracts that have an original expected duration of one year or less and contracts with variable consideration (e.g. discount revenue) is not required to be disclosed. Non-interest revenue expected to be recognized in future periods through remaining contracts with customers is not material.\n\n## Net Card Fees\n\nNet card fees represent revenue earned from annual card membership fees, which vary based on the type of card and the number of cards for each account. These fees, net of acquisition costs and a reserve for projected refunds for Card Member cancellations, are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month card membership period as Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income and are therefore more stable in relation to short term business or economic shifts. The unamortized net card fee balance is reported in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nEffective April 1, 2021, we prospectively changed the recognition of certain costs paid to a third party previously recognized over the twelve month card membership period in Net card fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income; such costs are now recorded as incurred in Marketing and business development expense. This change is not material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Fees and Commissions\n\nOther fees and commissions includes certain fees charged to Card Members, including delinquency fees and foreign currency conversion fees, which are primarily recognized in the period in which they are charged to the Card Member. Other fees and commissions also includes Membership Rewards program fees, which are deferred and recognized over the period covered by the fee, typically one year, the unamortized portion of which is included in Other liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, Other fees and commissions includes loyalty coalition-related fees, travel commissions and fees and service fees earned from merchants, that are recognized when the service is performed, which is generally in the period the fee is charged.

Furthermore, given intellectual property ownership and license rights surrounding artificial intelligence, such as generative artificial intelligence, are currently not fully addressed by courts or regulators, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against infringing use and our use or adoption of artificial intelligence may result in ex posure to claims by third parties.\n\n## Tax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex, require significant judgment and are subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, they are subject to challenge by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations, which could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. Refer to Note 20 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for information on the U.S. federal income tax audit of transfer pricing arrangements between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWe are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax  authorities may determine that we owe additional tax es or apply ex isting laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for tax es and interest in ex cess of accrued liabilities.\n\nLegislative action or inaction in the countries in which we have operations could increase our effective tax rate. For ex ample, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will impact how multinational enterprises (MNEs) are taxed on their global profits. In particular, the OECD's guidelines on a global minimum tax of 15 percent will impact the effective tax rate for many MNEs. Many countries have already implemented these minimum tax guidelines, with effective dates commencing in 2024. We expect that these minimum tax guidelines in their current form would increase our effective tax rate in future years. Furthermore, various provisions of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act will expire in 2025 unless extended. As a result, U.S. Congress may seek to enact significant tax legislation in the new session of Congress, which could result in higher levels of U.S. tax  on our global operations, increasing our effective tax  rate.\n\nJurisdictions may also make changes related to the tax treatment of card transactions, such as imposing taxes on Card Member rewards or prohibiting interchange fees on sales tax, which could decrease the value we provide to customers and adversely impact our business.\n\n## Our operations, business, customers and partners could be adversely affected by climate-related risks.\n\nThere are increasing and rapidly evolving concerns over climate-related risks and related environmental sustainability and recovery matters. We face physical risks related to climate, including rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of ex treme weather events and natural disasters. Such events and disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties on which we rely and could result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers' spending behaviors or ability to pay outstanding loans. Additionally, we may face risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences, travel patterns and legal requirements could impact our revenues or expenses or otherwise adversely affect our business, our customers and partners.\n\nWe may not be able to effectively identify, measure or control our exposure to climate-related risks, particularly given that the timing, nature and severity of the impacts of these risks may not be predictable. We could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of our climate-related initiatives and goals. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these goals, which depend in part on third-party performance, data that is outside of our control and methodologies that may evolve over time. We could be required to change our business, management practices and partnerships, incur expenses from changes to our technology, operations, products and services, and experience reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced stakeholder confidence, due to our response or perceived lack of response to climate and environmental issues.\n\n## Model, Credit, Market and Funding &amp; Liquidity Risks\n\n## Our use of models to manage risk and make business decisions may not be effective.\n\nWe use models and automation throughout our business, including to inform and support decision making, manage risks and estimate financial values. Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition, issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For ex ample, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes, such as because of changes in the credit profile of our Card Members, and they may not be able to predict future outcomes. Additionally, we increasingly use models that leverage artificial intelligence, which are subject to additional risks such as biased or inaccurate results or lowered interpretability. Our models also may not be able to function properly in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment given the lack of recent precedent. Certain models, such as models for credit loss accounting under Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) and Membership Rewards liability, require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments, and utilize forward-looking information. If our business decisions or financial estimates are based on incorrect or misused models and assumptions or we fail to manage data inputs effectively and to aggregate or analyze data in an accurate and timely manner, our results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.",

      "question": "How did American Express's billed business evolve from 2022 to 2024 in relation to its cobrand partner arrangements, particularly considering the 2024 disclosure that cobrand portfolios represented 25% of worldwide billed business, and how does this trend reflect on the company's competitive positioning given rising payments to partners and the risks associated with partner renewals?",
      "answer": "In 2022, billed business stood at $1,089.8 billion, showing a 25% increase from the prior year. By 2023, the company reported that this metric had grown further, with discount revenue rising 17%\u2014primarily driven by increased billed business. In 2024, American Express disclosed that cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 25% of worldwide billed business, or roughly $272 billion assuming total billed business exceeded $1.089 trillion again. However, the 2024 filing also noted that payments to cobrand partners have increased, particularly in the U.S., due to more competitive pressures and renegotiations. This growing dependence on cobrand relationships, which are subject to expiration and renegotiation risk, raises concerns about the sustainability of the billed business growth trajectory and the potential for declining margins or loss of market share if key partnerships are not renewed on favorable terms.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nMany of our competitors are subject to different, and in some cases, less stringent, legislative and regulatory regimes, and some may have lower cost structures and more agile business models and systems. More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\n\n## We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we work with partners such as Delta, Hilton, Marriott and British Airways to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and with partners in many industries, including Delta, to offer benefits and rewards to Card Members. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fix ed period unless ex tended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. Additionally, partners may make changes to the products and services they offer or otherwise become less desirable to our customers, which may lower the value of our products, such as the cobranded cards we issue to our customers. We may also choose not to renew certain cobrand relationships. Billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to such cobranded card portfolio, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ' above for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\n\n## Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and outages, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. For example, our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. For example, the operational rights relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business are owned by a business partner and the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions and compliance issues that impacted the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended, terminated or otherwise experience further issues in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers' ex perience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. We also face the risk that ex isting relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our",

      "answer": "In 2022, billed business represented 85% of total network volumes and grew 25% year-over-year, with G&S spending accounting for the majority and growing 19%, while T&E spending surged 59% as travel recovered post-pandemic. By 2024, co-branded card partnerships accounted for approximately 25% of worldwide billed business, highlighting a strategic shift toward reliance on these relationships. However, this increased dependence introduced new risks, including potential declines in billed business due to partner renegotiations or terminations. In 2023, the company formally defined billed business as 'transaction volumes (including cash advances) on payment products issued by American Express,' indicating a refined focus on this metric as a core performance indicator. The evolution from a broad-based growth narrative in 2022 to a more partner-dependent model by 2024 shows a transformation in how billed business is sourced and sustained.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nEffective for the first quarter of 2021, we changed the way we describe our volume metrics, replacing billed business, proprietary billed business and GNS billed business with network volumes, billed business and processed volumes, respectively. Within processed volumes we now include transactions associated with certain alternative payment solutions that were not previously reported in our volume metrics. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform with current period presentation. Refer to the 'Glossary of Selected Terminology' for definitions of each updated term.\n\n## NON-GAAP MEASURES\n\nWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP). However, certain information included within this report constitutes non-GAAP financial measures. Our calculations of non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculations of similarly titled measures by other companies.\n\n## BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT\n\nOur results for the year reflect the strong growth momentum we have seen in our business throughout 2021, and our strategy of investing in our customers, brand and talent is helping in our effort to drive share, scale and relevance. Spending on our network reached record levels and credit metrics remained around historic lows. Net income more than doubled versus the prior year to $8.1 billion and exceeded 2019 levels; contributing to this increase in Net income in the current year was a $2.5 billion credit reserve release and sizeable net gains on equity investments.\n\nYear-over-year comparisons reflect the adverse impacts on our business in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. As certain of the pandemic-related restrictions were lifted and macroeconomic conditions improved, and through the successful execution of our investment strategy, we saw a steady recovery in our business, with certain key areas growing beyond pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2021.\n\nWorldwide network volumes for the year increased 24 percent compared to the prior year and reached 2019 levels. Billed business, which represented 85 percent of our total network volumes and drives most of our financial results, increased 25 percent and continued to show different paces of recovery for G&amp;S and T&amp;E spend. G&amp;S spend, which accounts for the majority of our billed business, grew by 19 percent on a year-over-year basis, and was 18 percent above 2019 levels. This growth was primarily driven by ongoing strong performance in online and card-not-present spending even as offline spending fully recovered and resumed growth compared to 2019 levels. Global T&amp;E spend grew 59 percent versus the prior year, reflecting a steady recovery throughout the year, which resulted in fourth quarter T&amp;E volumes reaching 82 percent of 2019 levels. The year-over-year growth in billed business was led by the U.S., where spend increased 26 percent versus the prior year and exceeded 2019 levels by 6 percent, primarily driven by U.S. consumers and small and mid-sized enterprises.\n\nTotal revenues net of interest expense increased 17 percent year-over-year, reflecting double digit growth in all our non-interest revenue lines. Discount revenue, our largest revenue line, increased 26 percent year-over-year, driven primarily by growth in Card Member spending. Other fees and commissions and Other revenues increased year-over-year, primarily driven by higher travelrelated revenues. Net card fees grew consistently throughout 2021 and were up 11 percent year over year, as new card acquisitions increased, and Card Member retention remained high, demonstrating the impact of investments we have made in our premium value propositions. Net interest income declined 3 percent versus the prior year, primarily due to a decrease in net interest yields driven by higher paydown rates on revolving loan balances.\n\nCard Member loans increased 21 percent, which was lower than the growth in billed business due to higher paydown rates driven in part by the continued liquidity and financial strength of our customer base. Provisions for credit losses decreased and resulted in a net benefit, primarily due to a $2.5 billion reserve release in the current year versus a reserve build in the prior year and lower net write-offs in the current year. The reserve release in the current year was driven by improved portfolio quality and macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by an increase in the outstanding balance of loans and receivables. We do not expect to see reserve releases of this magnitude in 2022.\n\nCard Member rewards, Card Member services and business development expenses are generally correlated to volumes or are variable based on usage, and increased year-over-year due to growth in spend and higher usage of travel-related benefits. Additionally, our higher rewards expense versus last year was partially driven by an increase to our Membership Rewards liability to reflect a higher mix of redemptions in travel-related categories. During the year we increased marketing investments to build growth momentum and accelerate new card acquisitions. Our ongoing investments in differentiated value propositions and expansion of our digital capabilities are helping to drive increased Card Member engagement and strong retention rates. Our operating expenses for 2021 were in line with 2020; however, the current year included sizeable net gains associated with the Amex Ventures equity investments that we do not expect to occur with the same magnitude in 2022. We expect to continue to invest strategically in marketing, value propositions on our products, technology and our colleagues.",

More restrictive laws and regulations that do not apply to all of our competitors can put us at a disadvantage, including prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions, regulating our business practices or adversely affecting our cost structure.\n\n## We face intense competition for partner relationships, which could result in a loss or renegotiation of these arrangements that could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\nIn the ordinary course of our business we enter into different types of contractual arrangements with business partners in a variety of industries. For example, we work with partners such as Delta, Hilton, Marriott and British Airways to offer cobranded cards for consumers and small businesses, and with partners in many industries, including Delta, to offer benefits and rewards to Card Members. See 'Partners and Relationships' under 'Business' for additional information on our business partnerships, including with Delta.\n\nCompetition for relationships with key business partners is very intense and there can be no assurance we will be able to grow or maintain these partner relationships or that they will remain as profitable or valued by our customers. Establishing and retaining attractive cobrand card partnerships is particularly competitive among card issuers and networks as these partnerships typically appeal to high-spending loyal customers. All of our cobrand portfolios in the aggregate accounted for approximately 25 percent of our worldwide billed business for the year ended December 31, 2024. Card Member loans related to our cobrand portfolios accounted for approximately 36 percent of our worldwide Card Member loans as of December 31, 2024.\n\nCobrand arrangements are entered into for a fixed period, generally ranging from five to ten years, and will terminate in accordance with their terms, including at the end of the fix ed period unless ex tended or renewed at the option of the parties, or upon early termination as a result of an event of default or otherwise. We face the risk that we could lose partner relationships, even after we have invested significant resources in the relationships. Additionally, partners may make changes to the products and services they offer or otherwise become less desirable to our customers, which may lower the value of our products, such as the cobranded cards we issue to our customers. We may also choose not to renew certain cobrand relationships. Billed business could decline and Card Member attrition could increase, in each case, significantly as a result of the termination of one or more cobrand partnership relationships. In addition, some of our cobrand arrangements provide that, upon expiration or termination, the cobrand partner may purchase or designate a third party to purchase the loans generated with respect to such cobranded card portfolio, which could result in the loss of the card accounts and a significant decline in our Card Member loans outstanding.\n\nWe regularly seek to extend or renew cobrand arrangements in advance of the end of the contract term and face the risk that existing relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us, as competition for such relationships continues to increase. We make payments to our cobrand partners, which can be significant, based primarily on the amount of Card Member spending and corresponding rewards earned on such spending and, under certain arrangements, on the number of accounts acquired and retained. The amount we pay to our cobrand partners has increased, particularly in the United States, and may continue to increase as arrangements are renegotiated due to increasingly intense competition for cobrand partners among card issuers and networks.\n\nThe loss of exclusivity arrangements with business partners, the loss of the partner relationship altogether (whether by non-renewal at the end of the contract period, such as the end of our relationship with Costco in the United States in 2016, or as the result of a merger, legal or regulatory action or otherwise) or the renegotiation of existing partnerships with terms that are significantly worse for us could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations. See ' Our business is subject to evolving and comprehensive government regulation and supervision, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition ' above for information on the uncertainty regarding our cobrand and agent relationships in the EU. In addition, any publicity associated with the loss of any of our key business partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain Card Members and merchants, and could weaken our negotiating position with our remaining and prospective business partners.\n\n## Arrangements with our business partners represent a significant portion of our business. We are exposed to risks associated with our business partners, including reputational issues, business slowdowns, bankruptcies, liquidations, restructurings, consolidations and outages, and the possible obligation to make payments to our partners.\n\nOur success is, in many ways, dependent on the success of our partners. From customer acquisition to cobranding arrangements, from participation in our rewards programs to facilitating B2B supplier payments for our corporate clients, we rely on our business partners across many aspects of our company and our arrangements with business partners represent a significant portion of our business. For example, our two largest redemption partners are Amazon and Delta. Some of our partners manage certain aspects of our customer relationships, such as our OptBlue partners. To the extent any of our partners fail to effectively promote and support our products, experience a slowdown in their business, operational disruptions, reputational issues or loss of consumer confidence, or are otherwise unable to meet our expectations or those of their other stakeholders, our business may be materially negatively impacted. For example, the operational rights relating to our prepaid reloadable and gift card business are owned by a business partner and the reloadable operations have experienced disruptions and compliance issues that impacted the ability of our prepaid customers to load and use their cards. If such operations are interrupted, suspended, terminated or otherwise experience further issues in the future, it could further negatively impact our customers' ex perience, result in additional costs, litigation and regulatory action, and harm our business and reputation. We also face the risk that ex isting relationships will be renegotiated with less favorable terms for us or that we may be unable to renegotiate on terms that are acceptable to us. In addition, we may be obligated to make or accelerate payments to certain business partners such as cobrand partners upon the occurrence of certain triggering events such as a shortfall in certain performance and revenue levels. If we are not able to effectively manage these triggering events, we could unexpectedly have to make payments to these partners, which could have a negative effect on our",

In 2024, the Membership Rewards liability was highlighted as a key model risk, with the company noting that inaccurate assumptions or model misuses\u2014particularly under evolving macroeconomic conditions\u2014could materially affect financial estimates and results of operations.

We record a Membership Rewards liability that represents management's best estimate of the cost of points earned that are expected to be redeemed by Card Members in the future. The weighted average cost (WAC) per point and the Ultimate Redemption Rate (URR) are key assumptions used to estimate the liability. We use statistical and actuarial models to estimate the URR based on redemption trends, card product type, enrollment tenure, card spend levels and credit attributes. The WAC per point assumption is derived from 12 months of redemptions and is adjusted as appropriate for certain changes in redemption costs that are not representative of future cost expectations and expected developments in redemption patterns.\n\nThe expense for Membership Rewards points is included in Card Member rewards expense.

Furthermore, given intellectual property ownership and license rights surrounding artificial intelligence, such as generative artificial intelligence, are currently not fully addressed by courts or regulators, we may not be able to protect our intellectual property against infringing use and our use or adoption of artificial intelligence may result in ex posure to claims by third parties.\n\n## Tax legislative initiatives or assessments could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and in various foreign jurisdictions. The laws and regulations related to tax matters are extremely complex, require significant judgment and are subject to varying interpretations. Although management believes our positions are reasonable, they are subject to challenge by the Internal Revenue Service in the United States and by tax authorities in other jurisdictions in which we conduct business operations, which could have an adverse impact on our tax liabilities. Refer to Note 20 to the 'Consolidated Financial Statements' for information on the U.S. federal income tax audit of transfer pricing arrangements between our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries.\n\nWe are being challenged in a number of countries regarding our application of value-added taxes (VAT) to certain transactions. While we believe we comply with all applicable VAT and other tax laws, rules and regulations in the relevant jurisdictions, the tax  authorities may determine that we owe additional tax es or apply ex isting laws and regulations more broadly, which could result in a significant increase in liabilities for tax es and interest in ex cess of accrued liabilities.\n\nLegislative action or inaction in the countries in which we have operations could increase our effective tax rate. For ex ample, new guidelines issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will impact how multinational enterprises (MNEs) are taxed on their global profits. In particular, the OECD's guidelines on a global minimum tax of 15 percent will impact the effective tax rate for many MNEs. Many countries have already implemented these minimum tax guidelines, with effective dates commencing in 2024. We expect that these minimum tax guidelines in their current form would increase our effective tax rate in future years. Furthermore, various provisions of the Tax Cut and Jobs Act will expire in 2025 unless extended. As a result, U.S. Congress may seek to enact significant tax legislation in the new session of Congress, which could result in higher levels of U.S. tax  on our global operations, increasing our effective tax  rate.\n\nJurisdictions may also make changes related to the tax treatment of card transactions, such as imposing taxes on Card Member rewards or prohibiting interchange fees on sales tax, which could decrease the value we provide to customers and adversely impact our business.\n\n## Our operations, business, customers and partners could be adversely affected by climate-related risks.\n\nThere are increasing and rapidly evolving concerns over climate-related risks and related environmental sustainability and recovery matters. We face physical risks related to climate, including rising average global temperatures, rising sea levels and an increase in the frequency and severity of ex treme weather events and natural disasters. Such events and disasters could disrupt our operations or the operations of customers or third parties on which we rely and could result in market volatility or negatively impact our customers' spending behaviors or ability to pay outstanding loans. Additionally, we may face risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. Changes in consumer preferences, travel patterns and legal requirements could impact our revenues or expenses or otherwise adversely affect our business, our customers and partners.\n\nWe may not be able to effectively identify, measure or control our exposure to climate-related risks, particularly given that the timing, nature and severity of the impacts of these risks may not be predictable. We could be criticized for the timing, scope or nature of our climate-related initiatives and goals. There can be no assurance that we will achieve these goals, which depend in part on third-party performance, data that is outside of our control and methodologies that may evolve over time. We could be required to change our business, management practices and partnerships, incur expenses from changes to our technology, operations, products and services, and experience reputational harm as a result of negative public sentiment, regulatory scrutiny and reduced stakeholder confidence, due to our response or perceived lack of response to climate and environmental issues.\n\n## Model, Credit, Market and Funding &amp; Liquidity Risks\n\n## Our use of models to manage risk and make business decisions may not be effective.\n\nWe use models and automation throughout our business, including to inform and support decision making, manage risks and estimate financial values. Although we have a governance framework for model development and independent model validation, the modeling methodology or key assumptions could be erroneous or the models could be misused. In addition, issues with the quality or effectiveness of our data aggregation and validation procedures, as well as the quality and integrity of data inputs, could result in ineffective or inaccurate model outputs and reports. For ex ample, models based on historical data sets might not be accurate predictors of future outcomes, such as because of changes in the credit profile of our Card Members, and they may not be able to predict future outcomes. Additionally, we increasingly use models that leverage artificial intelligence, which are subject to additional risks such as biased or inaccurate results or lowered interpretability. Our models also may not be able to function properly in the current geopolitical and macroeconomic environment given the lack of recent precedent. Certain models, such as models for credit loss accounting under Current Expected Credit Loss (CECL) and Membership Rewards liability, require us to make difficult, subjective and complex judgments, and utilize forward-looking information.

      "question": "How did PayPal's allowance for consumer loans change from 2022 to 2024 in relation to consumer receivables balances, and what does this pattern reveal about their credit risk management approach?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's outstanding consumer receivables balances fluctuated: $3.8 billion as of December 31, 2022, rising to $5.9 billion in 2023, and then declining slightly to $4.8 billion by the end of 2024. Correspondingly, PayPal adjusted its allowance for consumer loans to reflect these changes in exposure. In 2022, the company emphasized the use of delinquency trends and internally developed risk models to determine the allowance, in line with its broader credit risk management strategy. In 2023, PayPal provided more granular data on gross charge-offs and delinquency status by year of origination, indicating a more refined approach to assessing and provisioning for credit risk. By 2024, the company summarized allowance activity in a dedicated table, showing a formalized and transparent methodology for tracking provisioning changes over time. This evolving pattern suggests that PayPal was adapting its credit risk management practices to align with the volatility in consumer receivables, enhancing both the precision and visibility of its allowance determinations as credit exposure fluctuated across the three-year period.",

        "Hop 1: [PYPL](2023) \u2192 [Allowance for Consumer Loans]: In 2023, PayPal disclosed detailed tables showing delinquency status and gross charge-offs of consumer loans by year of origination, indicating a more structured approach to determining the allowance for consumer loans.",
        "Hop 2: [PYPL](2024) \u2192 [Allowance for Consumer Loans]: In 2024, PayPal included a summary table of allowance activity for consumer loans and interest receivable, showing a formalized process for tracking allowance changes year over year.",

Our revolving credit product consists of PayPal Credit in the U.K. Once a consumer is approved for credit, it is made available to them as a funding source. Additionally, we offer installment credit products (known as buy now, pay later) at the time of checkout in various locations including the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Japan. The majority of the installment loans allow consumers to pay for a product over periods of 12 months or less. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding balance of consumer receivables, which consisted of revolving and installment loans and interest receivable, was $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.\n\nWe closely monitor the credit quality of our consumer receivables to evaluate and manage our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins with initial underwriting and continues through to full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal historical experience, including the consumer's prior repayment history with our credit products where available. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our models, to plan our collection practices and strategies, and in determining our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable.\n\nThe following tables present the delinquency status of consumer loans and interest receivable by year of origination. The amounts are based on the number of days past the billing date for revolving loans or contractual repayment date for installment loans. The 'current' category represents balances that are within 29 days of the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable.\n\n",

      "question": "How did PayPal's delinquency and charge-off trends in its merchant loans portfolio evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year pattern suggest about the credit quality and performance of the portfolio over time?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, PayPal's merchant loans portfolio showed a significant increase in current balances, rising from $13 million in 2022 to $1,274 million in 2024, indicating strong growth. However, this was accompanied by a notable rise in gross charge-offs, which increased from an unspecified but historically low level in 2022 to $96 million in 2023 and $10 million in 2024. Additionally, the data for 2024 shows that while the majority of the portfolio remained current (90.4%), a non-trivial portion (4.7% or $69 million) was 30\u201359 days delinquent. This suggests that while the portfolio expanded significantly and remained largely performing, there were emerging signs of credit stress, particularly in 2023, that may have required increased monitoring and modifications to manage delinquencies and mitigate losses.",

        "Hop 1: [PYPL](2023) \u2192 [Merchant Loans]: Discloses increased monitoring of modified merchant loans and advances to assess the effectiveness of modifications, indicating emerging credit concerns.",

        "Hop 3: [PYPL](2022) \u2192 [Merchant Loans]: Describes charge-off policies and delinquency criteria, noting improved portfolio performance in 2021 compared to 2020 and indicating that 2022 likely continued this trend of lower delinquencies before the 2023\u20132024 uptick."

          "chunk_text": "## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\nThe  decrease  in  the  charge-offs  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021  compared  to  2020  was  due  to  improved  portfolio performance. Additionally, charge offs increased in the year ended December 31, 2020 due to accounts that experienced financial difficulties as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor  merchant  loans  and  advances,  the  determination  of  delinquency  is  based  on  the  current  expected  or  contractual  repayment period of the loan or advance and fixed interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days, or when the repayments are 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment within the last 60 days. Bankrupt accounts are charged off within 60 days  of  receiving  notification  of  bankruptcy.  The  provision  for  credit  losses  on  merchant  loans  and  advances  is  recognized  in transaction and credit losses, and the provision for interest and fees receivable is recognized as a reduction of deferred revenue in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Charge-offs that are recovered are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable.\n\n## Troubled debt restructurings\n\nIn instances where a merchant is able to demonstrate that it is experiencing financial difficulty, there may be a modification of the loan or advance and the related interest or fee receivable for which it is probable that, without modification, we will be unable to collect all amounts due. These modifications are intended to provide merchants with financial relief, and help enable us to mitigate losses.\n\nThese modifications include an increase in term by approximately 1 to 5.5 years while moving the delinquency status to current. The fee on certain of these loans or advances remains unchanged over the extended term. Alternatively, certain loans and advances have been modified to replace the initial  fixed  fee  structure  at  the  time  the  loan  or  advance  was  extended  with  a  fixed  annual percentage rate applied over the amended remaining term, which will continue to accrue interest at the fixed rate until the earlier of maturity or charge-off. These modifications had a de minimis impact on our consolidated statements of income in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nAllowances for TDRs are assessed separately from other loans and advances within our portfolio and are determined by estimating current  expected  credit  losses  utilizing  the  modified  term  and  interest  rate  assumptions.  Historical  loss  estimates  are  utilized  in addition to macroeconomic assumptions to determine expected credit loss rates. Further, we may include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses.\n\nThe following tables  show  the  merchant  loans  and  interest  receivables  which  have  been  modified  as TDRs  in  the  years  ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n\n",

      "question": "What does the three-year trend in PayPal's consumer loans receivable from 2022 through 2024 suggest about the company's credit strategy, particularly in light of the 77% year-over-year growth in 2022, the ending balances of $357 million in 2023, and the decline to $341 million in 2024?",
      "answer": "The trend in PayPal's consumer loans receivable from 2022 through 2024 indicates a shift in credit strategy. In 2022, the company significantly expanded its consumer lending portfolio, with a 77% year-over-year increase in consumer loans and interest receivable, driven by growth in installment credit products internationally and in the U.S., as well as PayPal Credit in international markets. By 2023, the ending balance in consumer loans receivable reached $357 million, reflecting continued lending activity, albeit at a more measured pace. However, in 2024, the consumer loans receivable balance declined to $341 million, suggesting a more cautious approach to credit expansion, possibly in response to evolving macroeconomic conditions or internal risk management adjustments. This trajectory reveals a strategic pivot from aggressive international credit growth in 2022 to a more conservative stance by 2024.",

Allowances for our merchant and consumer portfolios included qualitative adjustments which took into account continued volatility with respect to macroeconomic conditions, as well as uncertainty around the financial health of our merchant borrowers, including uncertainty  around  the  effectiveness  of  loan  modification  programs  made  available  to  merchants.  The  credit  losses  in  the  year ended December 31, 2020 were primarily associated with an increase in provisions for our loans receivable portfolio resulting from a reserve build driven by a sharp deterioration in macroeconomic projections reflecting the anticipated impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and provisions associated with originations, both of which significantly increased our then current expected credit losses, and  to  a  lesser  extent,  changes  in  credit  quality  during  the  period.  The  increase  in  provisions  associated  with  macroeconomic projections in the year ended December 31, 2020 included qualitative adjustments to account for the impact of limitations in our expected credit loss models resulting from the extreme fluctuations in both the actual and projected macroeconomic conditions during  the  period  as  well  as  to  incorporate  varying  degrees  of  merchant  performance  in  the  current  environment  and  expected performance in future periods.\n\nThe  consumer  loans  and  interest  receivable  balance  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020  was  $3.8  billion  and  $2.2  billion, respectively,  representing  a  year-over-year  increase  of  77%  driven  by  growth  of  our  installment  credit  products  in  international markets and the U.S. and, to a lesser extent, growth of PayPal Credit in international markets. Approximately 53% and 77% of our consumer loans receivable outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were due from consumers in the U.K. The decline in the percentage of consumer loans receivable outstanding in the U.K. at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 was due to overall growth in the consumer loan portfolio, particularly from installment credit products in other markets.\n\nThe following table provides information regarding the credit quality of our consumer loans and interest receivable balance:\n\n",

      "question": "How did PayPal's forecast period for revolving consumer loan credit losses evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this multi-year shift suggest about the company's long-term risk modeling assumptions?",
      "answer": "In 2022, PayPal used a 2-year reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving consumer loan credit losses. By 2023, this forecast period was extended to approximately 5 years and 7 months. The same extended forecast period was maintained in 2024, indicating a strategic shift toward longer-term macroeconomic modeling for credit risk. This evolution suggests PayPal has increasingly prioritized long-term economic trends\u2014such as household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales\u2014over shorter-term fluctuations in assessing the credit quality of its revolving consumer loan portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PYPL](2023) \u2192 [Allowance for Consumer Loans]: In 2023, the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving consumer products was updated to approximately 5 years and 7 months, up from 2022 levels, incorporating macroeconomic factors like household disposable income.",
        "Hop 2: [PYPL](2024) \u2192 [Allowance for Consumer Loans]: In 2024, PayPal maintained the same 5 years and 7 months forecast period for revolving products, signaling consistency in long-term modeling approach post-adjustment.",
        "Hop 3: [PYPL](2022) \u2192 [Allowance for Consumer Loans]: In 2022, the forecast period for revolving consumer loans was only 2 years, significantly shorter than in the following years."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## PayPal Holdings, Inc.\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS-(Continued)\n\nThe allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable not classified as held for sale is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data and incorporates macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. The consumer loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, loan term, delinquency, credit rating, vintage, and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in household disposable income and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. For both 2024 and 2023, the reasonable and supportable forecast period for revolving products and installment products (not classified as held for sale) that we have included in our projected loss rates, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, was approximately 5 years and 7 months to 3.5 years, respectively. Projected loss rates (inclusive of historical loss data and for the revolving credit portfolio, macroeconomic factors) are derived based on and applied to the principal amount of our consumer receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses, such as expectations of macroeconomic conditions not captured in the loss models for our installment products (not classified as held for sale). The allowance for current ex pected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors.\n\nWe charge off consumer receivable balances in the month in which a customer's balance becomes 180 days past the billing date or contractual repayment date, except for the U.S. consumer interest-bearing installment receivables, which are charged off 120 days past the contractual repayment date. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable. Loans receivable continue to accrue interest until they are charged off.\n\nIn  connection  with  the  sale  of  our  eligible  consumer  installment  receivables  and  the  reclassification  of  that  portfolio  as  held  for  sale  in  2023,  we  reversed  the previously recorded allowances for credit losses associated with those loans and interest receivable balances. Charge-offs and any adjustments to the fair value of loans and interest receivable, held for sale, are recorded in restructuring and other on our consolidated statement of income (loss).\n\nThe allowance for merchant loans, advances, and interest and fees receivable is primarily based on expectations of credit losses based on historical lifetime loss data as well as macroeconomic forecasts applied to the portfolio. In the third quarter of 2024, we updated our expected credit loss model for our PPWC portfolio to reflect its current risk characteristics. These changes did not have a material impact on our provision recorded in the year ended December 31, 2024. The merchant loss models incorporate various portfolio attributes including geographic region, first borrowing versus repeat borrowing, delinquency, internally developed risk ratings, and vintage, as well as macroeconomic factors such as forecasted trends in unemployment rates and retail e-commerce sales. The forecasted macroeconomic factors are sourced externally, using a single scenario that we believe is most appropriate to the economic conditions applicable to a particular period. The reasonable and supportable forecast period for merchant products that we have included in our projected loss rates for 2024 and 2023, which approximates the estimated life of the loans, was approximately 2.5 to 3.5 years. Projected loss rates, inclusive of historical loss data and macroeconomic factors, are derived based on and applied to the principal amount of our merchant receivables. We also include qualitative adjustments that incorporate incremental information not captured in the quantitative estimates of our current expected credit losses. The allowance for current expected credit losses on interest and fees receivable is determined primarily by applying loss curves to each portfolio by geography, delinquency, and period of origination, among other factors.\n\nFor merchant loans and advances, the determination of delinquency is based on the current expected or contractual repayment period of the loan or advance and fix ed  interest or fee payment as compared to the original expected or contractual repayment period. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPBL product when the repayments are 180 days past the contractual repayment date. We charge off the receivables outstanding under our PPWC product when the repayments are 180 days past our expectation of repayments and the merchant has not made a payment in the last 60 days, or when the repayments are 360 days past due regardless of whether the merchant has made a payment in the last 60 days. Charge-offs are recorded as a reduction to our allowance for loans and interest receivable and subsequent recoveries, if any, are recorded as an increase to the allowance for loans and interest receivable.\n\n68",

Our revolving credit product consists of PayPal Credit in the U.K. Once a consumer is approved for credit, it is made available to them as a funding source. Additionally, we offer installment credit products (known as buy now, pay later) at the time of checkout in various locations including the U.S., Europe, Australia, and Japan. The majority of the installment loans allow consumers to pay for a product over periods of 12 months or less. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding balance of consumer receivables, which consisted of revolving and installment loans and interest receivable, was $3.8 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively.\n\nWe closely monitor the credit quality of our consumer receivables to evaluate and manage our related exposure to credit risk. Credit risk management begins with initial underwriting and continues through to full repayment of a loan. To assess a consumer who requests a loan, we use, among other indicators, internally developed risk models using detailed information from external sources, such as credit bureaus where available, and internal historical experience, including the consumer's prior repayment history with our credit products where available. We use delinquency status and trends to assist in making new and ongoing credit decisions, to adjust our models, to plan our collection practices and strategies, and in determining our allowance for consumer loans and interest receivable.\n\nThe following tables present the delinquency status of consumer loans and interest receivable by year of origination. The amounts are based on the number of days past the billing date for revolving loans or contractual repayment date for installment loans. The 'current' category represents balances that are within 29 days of the billing date or contractual repayment date, as applicable.\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased by 5.9%, while on a local currency basis it increased by 12.3% compared to 2021. In 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis increased by 10.4%, while on a local currency basis it increased by 11.9% compared to 2022. In 2024, GDV continued to be reported on both a U.S. dollar-converted and local currency basis, with the company emphasizing the importance of local currency reporting to eliminate foreign exchange volatility. The trend shows that the U.S. dollar strengthening against local currencies consistently dampened GDV growth when measured in U.S. dollars compared to local currency growth, indicating a persistent foreign exchange headwind that narrowed year-over-year growth differentials between the two measurement bases.",

We  believe  that  the  key  metrics  presented  facilitate  an understanding of our operating and financial performance and provide a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\n\nOperaHng  Margin measures  how  much  profit  we  make  on  each  dollar  of  sales  aVer  our  operaEng  costs  but  before  other  income  (expense)  and  income  tax expense. Operating margin is calculated by dividing our operating income by net revenue.\n\n## Key Drivers\n\nGross Dollar Volume ('GDV') measures dollar volume of acEvity, including both domesEc and cross-border volume, on cards carrying our brands during the period, on a local currency basis and  U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume; 'purchase volume' means the aggregate dollar amount  of  purchases  made  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period;  and  'cash  volume'  means  the  aggregate  dollar  amount  of  cash disbursements  and  includes  the  impact  of  balance  transfers  and  convenience  checks  obtained  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant  period. InformaEon denominated in U.S. dollars relaEng to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency i n which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  We report periodover-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency informaEon, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. 1\n\nCross-border Volume Growth measures the growth of cross-border dollar volume during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs.",

By 2024, GDV on a local currency basis grew by 11%, reaching $9.8 trillion, showing sustained transaction momentum despite ongoing foreign exchange volatility. This 3-year trend suggests that while MA's core business is expanding consistently, currency fluctuations have had a material effect on reported GDV growth, especially in 2022 when the U.S. dollar was particularly strong.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard's Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) growth showed a consistent upward trend on a local currency basis, increasing from 12.3% in 2022 to 11.9% in 2023, and remaining robust in 2024, although exact figures for 2024 are not quantified in the provided text. However, the U.S. dollar-converted GDV growth fluctuated: it rose 5.9% in 2022, accelerated to 10.4% in 2023, and while not explicitly stated for 2024, the continued emphasis on GDV in key metrics suggests sustained growth. This divergence between local currency and U.S. dollar-converted growth highlights the impact of foreign exchange movements on reported financial performance and indicates that Mastercard's underlying transactional volume growth remains strong globally, even as currency translation effects moderate or amplify headline growth depending on the strength of the U.S. dollar.",

We believe  that  the  key  metrics  presented  facilitate  an  understanding  of  our  operating  and  financial  performance  and  provide  a meaningful comparison of our results between periods.\n\nGross  Dollar  Volume  ('GDV') measures  dollar  volume  of  activity  on  cards  carrying  our  brands  during  the  period,  on  a  local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis. GDV represents purchase volume plus cash volume and includes the impact of balance  transfers  and  convenience  checks;  'purchase  volume'  means  the  aggregate  dollar  amount  of  purchases  made  with Mastercard-branded cards for the relevant period; and 'cash volume' means the aggregate dollar amount of cash disbursements and  includes  the  impact  of  balance  transfers  and  convenience  checks  obtained  with  Mastercard-branded  cards  for  the  relevant period. Information denominated in U.S. dollars relating to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency in which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.  We report period-over-period rates of change in purchase volume and cash volume on the basis of local currency information, in order to eliminate the impact of changes in the value of currencies against the U.S. dollar in calculating such rates of change. 1\n\nCross-border Volume measures cross-border dollar volume initiated and switched through our network during the period, on a local currency basis and U.S. dollar-converted basis, for all Mastercard-branded programs. 2\n\nSwitched  Transactions measures  the  number  of  transactions  switched  by  Mastercard,  which  is  defined  as  the  number  of transactions initiated and switched through our network during the period. 2",

InformaEon denominated in U.S. dollars relaEng to GDV is calculated by applying an established U.S. dollar/local currency exchange rate for each local currency i n which our volumes are reported. These exchange rates are calculated on a quarterly basis using the average exchange rate for each quarter.

      "question": "How did the growth and currency impact on Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this reveal about Mastercard's cross-border transaction dynamics and foreign exchange exposure?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Mastercard's Gross Dollar Volume (GDV) showed a consistent upward trend, but with notable differences in growth rates when measured in local currency versus U.S. dollar-converted terms. In 2022, GDV grew 21% on a local currency basis, while in 2023, GDV on a local currency basis increased by 11.9% compared to the prior year. In 2024, GDV continued to be a key performance metric, with Mastercard explicitly defining its measurement methodology, including the use of quarterly average exchange rates to convert local currency volumes into U.S. dollars. However, the impact of foreign exchange became more pronounced: in 2023, GDV on a U.S. dollar-converted basis grew only 10.4%, compared to 11.9% on a local currency basis, indicating a slight headwind from currency translation. This trend suggests that while underlying transaction volumes were growing, the strengthening U.S. dollar dampened the reported GDV growth in dollar terms. The company actively managed this exposure through foreign exchange derivatives, as disclosed in 2023, to mitigate the impact of currency volatility on revenue and incentives tied to GDV.",

      "answer": "MA's operating lease amortization expense increased from $137 million in 2022 to $141 million in 2023, and further to $145 million in 2024. This consistent rise indicates that the company's leasing activities either expanded or shifted toward more costly arrangements over time. Additionally, the weighted-average remaining lease term decreased from 8.4 years in 2022 to 8.2 years in 2023 and further to 8.0 years in 2024, suggesting a shortening of lease durations, potentially reflecting strategic adjustments or market constraints. The weighted-average discount rate also increased from 2.5% in 2022 to 3.3% in 2023 and 3.5% in 2024, indicating a response to rising interest rates or perceived risk.

      "question": "How did the value of restricted security deposits held for customers evolve across 2022, 2023, and 2024, and what does this progression indicate about Mastercard's risk mitigation strategies and customer collateral requirements over time?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard disclosed the existence and nature of restricted security deposits held for customers as part of its risk mitigation arrangements, though no specific dollar amount was provided. In 2023, the company reported an increase in restricted security deposits held for customers as a contributor to operating cash flow, signaling a growing reliance on or expansion of these arrangements. By 2024, the value of restricted security deposits held for customers stood at $1.874 billion, up from $1.845 billion in 2023, showing a continued upward trend. This progression suggests that Mastercard's risk mitigation strategies became more reliant on customer collateral over the three-year period, likely to manage settlement exposure amid increasing transaction volumes or higher-risk customer profiles.",

          "chunk_text": "Long-lived  assets,  other  than  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  are  tested  for  impairment  whenever  events  or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, the fair value of the asset is calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment is recorded.\n\nImpairment charges, if any, are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nLitigation - The Company is a party to certain legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and accrues a loss contingency when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies are recorded in provision for litigation on the consolidated statement of operations. These judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the  merits  of  its  defenses  and  consultation  with  in-house  and  external  legal  counsel.  Legal  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  and recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nSettlement  and  other  risk  management -  Mastercard's  rules  guarantee  the  settlement  of  many  of  the  transactions  between  its customers. Settlement exposure is the outstanding settlement risk to customers under Mastercard's rules due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement. While the term and amount of the guarantee are unlimited, the duration of settlement exposure is short term and typically limited to a few days.\n\nThe Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions  with  the  Company. As  the  extent  of  the  Company's  obligations  under  these  agreements  depends  entirely  upon  the occurrence of future events, the Company's potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable.\n\nThe Company accounts for each of its guarantees by recording the guarantee at its fair value at the inception or modification date through earnings.\n\nIncome taxes - The Company follows an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes as required under GAAP. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  and  income  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities.  Deferred  income  taxes  are displayed  separately  as  noncurrent  assets  and  liabilities  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  Valuation  allowances  are  provided against  assets  which  are  not  more  likely  than  not  to  be  realized.  The  Company  recognizes  all  material  tax  positions,  including uncertain  tax  positions  in  which  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  position  will  be  sustained  based  on  its  technical  merits  and  if challenged  by  the  relevant  taxing  authorities. At  each  balance  sheet  date,  unresolved  uncertain  tax  positions  are  reassessed  to determine whether subsequent developments require a change in the amount of recognized tax benefit. The allowance for uncertain tax positions is recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company records interest expense related to income tax matters as interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations. The Company includes penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision.\n\nCash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include certain investments with daily liquidity and with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\nRestricted cash - The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents as restricted when it is unavailable for withdrawal or use in its general operations. The Company has the following types of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents which are included in the reconciliation of beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n\n- Restricted cash for litigation settlement - The Company has restricted cash for litigation within a qualified settlement fund related to  the  settlement  agreement for  the  U.S.  merchant  class  litigation. The  funds  continue  to  be  restricted  for  payments  until  the litigation matter is resolved.\n- Restricted  security  deposits  held  for  customers -  The  Company  requires  certain  customers  to  enter  into  risk  mitigation arrangements, including cash collateral and/or other forms of credit enhancement such as letters of credit and guarantees, for settlement of their transactions. Certain risk mitigation arrangements for settlement, such as standby letters of credit and bank guarantees,  are  not  recorded  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  The  Company  also  holds  cash  deposits  and  certificates  of deposit from certain customers as collateral for settlement of their transactions, which are recorded as assets on the consolidated balance  sheet.  These  assets  are  fully  offset  by  corresponding  liabilities  included  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  These security deposits are typically held for the duration of the agreement with the customers.\n- Other restricted cash balances - The Company has other restricted cash balances which include contractually restricted deposits, as well as cash balances that are restricted based on the Company's intention with regard to usage. These funds are classified on the consolidated balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets.",

      "answer": "MA's Indefinite-lived Customer Relationships value increased slightly from $156 million in 2022 to $162 million in 2023 before declining to $153 million in 2024. This fluctuation may indicate a period of initial customer base expansion followed by challenges in sustaining those relationships. The 3.8% increase in 2023 suggests successful customer acquisition or revaluation of existing relationships, while the 5.6% decrease in 2024 could signal customer attrition or impairments. Without explicit explanations from MA regarding these changes, it's reasonable to infer that the company experienced mixed performance in maintaining long-term customer value, with early gains not being fully sustained into the following year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Mastercard reported settlement assets at $1,319 million, with corresponding settlement obligations at $913 million. By 2023, settlement assets decreased to $1,233 million, while settlement obligations rose to $1,399 million, indicating a tighter liquidity position and increased liability exposure. In 2024, settlement assets rebounded significantly to $1,821 million, and settlement obligations further increased to $2,316 million, showing a growing need for settlement guarantees across the network. This trajectory reflects an expanding role in guaranteeing transactions, with the company increasing its financial commitments to ensure settlement finality, even as it maintains higher asset buffers to support these obligations.",

      "answer": "MA's operating lease amortization expense increased steadily from $122 million in 2022 to $141 million in 2023, and further to $145 million in 2024. This upward trend indicates that the company's leasing activity and associated financial obligations have grown over the three-year period. Additionally, the weighted-average remaining lease term declined from 8.4 years in 2022 to 8.0 years in 2024, suggesting a shift toward shorter-term leases, while the weighted-average discount rate rose from 2.5% in 2022 to 3.5% in 2024, reflecting potential changes in financing costs or market conditions.",

          "chunk_text": "Long-lived  assets,  other  than  goodwill  and  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets,  are  tested  for  impairment  whenever  events  or circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of the asset cannot be recovered from estimated future cash flows, undiscounted and without interest, the fair value of the asset is calculated using the present value of estimated net future cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment is recorded.\n\nImpairment charges, if any, are recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nLitigation - The Company is a party to certain legal and regulatory proceedings with respect to a variety of matters. The Company evaluates the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome of all legal or regulatory proceedings to which it is a party and accrues a loss contingency when the loss is probable and reasonably estimable. Loss contingencies are recorded in provision for litigation on the consolidated statement of operations. These judgments are subjective based on the status of the legal or regulatory proceedings, the  merits  of  its  defenses  and  consultation  with  in-house  and  external  legal  counsel.  Legal  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  and recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations.\n\nSettlement  and  other  risk  management -  Mastercard's  rules  guarantee  the  settlement  of  many  of  the  transactions  between  its customers. Settlement exposure is the outstanding settlement risk to customers under Mastercard's rules due to the difference in timing between the payment transaction date and subsequent settlement. While the term and amount of the guarantee are unlimited, the duration of settlement exposure is short term and typically limited to a few days.\n\nThe Company also enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business under which the Company agrees to indemnify third parties against damages, losses and expenses incurred in connection with legal and other proceedings arising from relationships or transactions  with  the  Company. As  the  extent  of  the  Company's  obligations  under  these  agreements  depends  entirely  upon  the occurrence of future events, the Company's potential future liability under these agreements is not determinable.\n\nThe Company accounts for each of its guarantees by recording the guarantee at its fair value at the inception or modification date through earnings.\n\nIncome taxes - The Company follows an asset and liability based approach in accounting for income taxes as required under GAAP. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recorded to reflect the tax consequences on future years of temporary differences between  the  financial  statement  carrying  amounts  and  income  tax  bases  of  assets  and  liabilities.  Deferred  income  taxes  are displayed  separately  as  noncurrent  assets  and  liabilities  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  Valuation  allowances  are  provided against  assets  which  are  not  more  likely  than  not  to  be  realized.  The  Company  recognizes  all  material  tax  positions,  including uncertain  tax  positions  in  which  it  is  more  likely  than  not  that  the  position  will  be  sustained  based  on  its  technical  merits  and  if challenged  by  the  relevant  taxing  authorities. At  each  balance  sheet  date,  unresolved  uncertain  tax  positions  are  reassessed  to determine whether subsequent developments require a change in the amount of recognized tax benefit. The allowance for uncertain tax positions is recorded in other current and noncurrent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company records interest expense related to income tax matters as interest expense on the consolidated statement of operations. The Company includes penalties related to income tax matters in the income tax provision.\n\nCash and cash equivalents - Cash and cash equivalents include certain investments with daily liquidity and with an original maturity of three months or less from the date of purchase. Cash equivalents are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value.\n\nRestricted cash - The Company classifies cash and cash equivalents as restricted when it is unavailable for withdrawal or use in its general operations. The Company has the following types of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents which are included in the reconciliation of beginning-of-period and end-of-period amounts shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows:\n\n- Restricted cash for litigation settlement - The Company has restricted cash for litigation within a qualified settlement fund related to  the  settlement  agreement for  the  U.S.  merchant  class  litigation. The  funds  continue  to  be  restricted  for  payments  until  the litigation matter is resolved.\n- Restricted  security  deposits  held  for  customers -  The  Company  requires  certain  customers  to  enter  into  risk  mitigation arrangements, including cash collateral and/or other forms of credit enhancement such as letters of credit and guarantees, for settlement of their transactions. Certain risk mitigation arrangements for settlement, such as standby letters of credit and bank guarantees,  are  not  recorded  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  The  Company  also  holds  cash  deposits  and  certificates  of deposit from certain customers as collateral for settlement of their transactions, which are recorded as assets on the consolidated balance  sheet.  These  assets  are  fully  offset  by  corresponding  liabilities  included  on  the  consolidated  balance  sheet.  These security deposits are typically held for the duration of the agreement with the customers.\n- Other restricted cash balances - The Company has other restricted cash balances which include contractually restricted deposits, as well as cash balances that are restricted based on the Company's intention with regard to usage. These funds are classified on the consolidated balance sheet within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets.",

      "question": "How did Mastercard's settlement assets evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this 3-year trajectory suggest about the company's exposure to settlement-related obligations and its liquidity positioning?",
      "answer": "Mastercard's settlement assets decreased from $1,319 million in 2022 to $1,233 million in 2023, before increasing significantly to $1,821 million in 2024. This trajectory indicates a short-term reduction in settlement assets in 2023, followed by a substantial rebound in 2024. The increase in 2024 aligns with a rise in settlement obligations, which grew from $1,399 million in 2023 to $2,316 million in 2024, suggesting that the company's exposure to settlement-related liabilities expanded over the period. The liquidity positioning appears to have adjusted accordingly, as total current assets also increased each year\u2014$16,949 million in 2022, $18,961 million in 2023, and $19,724 million in 2024\u2014supporting the company's ability to manage this growing exposure.",

      "answer": "Mastercard's settlement assets were $1,319 million in 2022, increased to $1,821 million in 2024, with 2023 showing $1,233 million. This indicates a significant increase in settlement assets over the three-year period, particularly between 2022 and 2024, suggesting growth in payment network transaction volume and potentially longer settlement timing in certain markets or products.",

        "Hop 1: [MA](2023) \u2192 [Settlement Assets]: Discloses settlement assets at $1,233 million, indicating short-term exposure from payment transaction timing differences.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Schwab\u2019s relationship with payables to brokerage clients evolved significantly, directly influencing net interest revenue and funding strategy. In 2022, payables to brokerage clients increased due to strong client cash allocations driven by a low interest rate environment, contributing to a 46% year-over-year increase in average interest-earning assets and supporting net interest revenue growth. By 2023, however, rising market interest rates caused clients to reallocate cash out of sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions, resulting in a 21% decrease in average interest-earning assets compared to 2022 and a $1.3 billion decline in net interest revenue. This shift forced Schwab to rely more heavily on higher-cost supplemental funding sources like brokered CDs, which totaled $36.0 billion in 2023. In 2024, the company continued to manage this transition, prioritizing the repayment of these higher-cost funds and expecting balances to decline over time as client behavior stabilized. The three-year trajectory reveals a clear shift from asset growth and margin expansion in a low-rate environment to margin pressure and strategic funding adjustments in a rising-rate environment.",

Net premium amortization of investment securities decreased to $830 million in 2023 from $1.4 billion in 2022 as a result of increases in market interest rates and a smaller investment securities portfolio. Average interest-earning assets for 2023 were lower by 21% compared to 2022, which was primarily due to lower bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients as a result of clients allocating cash out of sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions due to higher market interest rates.

Accelerated premium amortization stemming from elevated prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities in the AFS portfolio continued in 2021 and partially offset the growth in net interest revenue. Net premium amortization of investment securities totaled $2.3 billion in 2021 and $1.6 billion in 2020. TD Ameritrade contributed total net interest revenue of $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $443 million in 2020 from October 6, through December 31, 2020.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2021 were higher by 46%, compared to 2020. This increase was largely due to higher bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, which resulted from strong net new client asset inflows, continued heightened client cash allocations driven by the low interest rate environment, BDA balance migrations, and the inclusion of TD Ameritrade for all of 2021.\n\nOur net interest margin declined to 1.45% in 2021, from 1.62% in 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by lower overall yields received on interest-earning assets, in part due to purchases of investment securities in 2020 and 2021 at rates below the average yield on the AFS portfolio. This more than offset the benefit of increased securities lending revenue and higher margin utilization in 2021, which comprised 39% of net interest revenue during 2021, growing from 19% of net interest revenue in 2020.\n\nNet interest revenue decreased $403 million, or 6%, in 2020 from 2019, due primarily to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets and our acquisition of TD Ameritrade. Accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue, as the decline in long-term interest rates in 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities. Average interest-earning assets for 2020 were higher by 40%, compared to 2019. This increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, due to higher client cash allocations and our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAAIMCO. TD Ameritrade contributed approximately $12.0 billion of average interest-earning assets and $9.6 billion of average interest-bearing liabilities to Schwab's full-year 2020 averages.\n\nOur net interest margin decreased to 1.62% in 2020, from 2.41% in 2019. This decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve's 2019 and 2020 interest rate reductions as well as higher premium amortization on mortgage-related debt securities. Due to the low interest rate environment, purchases of investment securities in 2020 were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio, which negatively impacted our net interest margin.\n\n## Asset Management and Administration Fees\n\nAsset management and administration fees include mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds.

Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees. Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade are primarily earned on client assets invested in money market mutual funds and other mutual funds, as well as advice solutions.\n\nAsset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity.",

      "question": "How did the trend in payables to brokerage clients at Charles Schwab evolve from 2022 to 2023, and how does this shift correlate with the 12% decline in net interest revenue observed in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Charles Schwab reported $125,671 million in payables to brokerage clients. This figure decreased in 2023, driven by clients reallocating cash from sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions amid rising interest rates, which contributed to a 12% decline in net interest revenue. The drop in payables reflects reduced client cash balances, signaling a shift in client behavior that directly impacted Schwab's interest income. This trend highlights a multi-year evolution where changes in client fund allocation directly influenced both balance sheet composition and revenue performance.",

Net premium amortization of investment securities decreased to $830 million in 2023 from $1.4 billion in 2022 as a result of increases in market interest rates and a smaller investment securities portfolio. Average interest-earning assets for 2023 were lower by 21% compared to 2022, which was primarily due to lower bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients as a result of clients allocating cash out of sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions due to higher market interest rates.

Asset management and administration fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds and do not include securities lending revenues earned by proprietary mutual funds, ETFs, and CTFs, as those amounts, net of program fees, are credited to the fund shareholders. Proprietary CTFs may, but generally do not, directly participate in securities lending.

Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees, such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees.\n\nAsset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity.\n\nThe following table presents asset management and administration fees, average client assets, and average fee yields:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the evolution of Charles Schwab's payables to brokerage clients from 2022 to 2024 reflect client responses to rising interest rates, and what were the implications for Schwab's funding dynamics?",
      "answer": "In 2022, payables to brokerage clients were a significant liability at $37.599 billion, indicating substantial client cash balances held in sweep products. By 2023, these payables had declined notably as clients reallocated $36.0 billion in cash from sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions in response to rising interest rates, contributing to a 21% drop in average interest-earning assets and increased reliance on higher-cost supplemental funding sources like FHLB borrowings and brokered CDs. In 2024, while the trend of client reallocation had slowed, Schwab still faced ongoing funding challenges, including the need to roll over certain borrowings and uncertainty around future client behavior and interest rate paths. This three-year progression shows a clear shift in client behavior driven by interest rate increases, forcing Schwab to adapt its funding strategy while managing declining core deposit balances.",

      "question": "How did the dynamics of Schwab's payables to brokerage clients evolve from 2022 through 2024, and what does this trend reveal about client cash allocation behavior in response to changing interest rate environments?",
      "answer": "Schwab's payables to brokerage clients decreased from $97.438 billion in 2022 to $84.786 billion in 2023, reflecting a shift in client cash allocation behavior as higher market interest rates encouraged movement out of sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions. In 2022, the low interest rate environment led to increased client cash allocations, contributing to higher payables. By 2024, this trend continued as Schwab's net interest revenue analysis showed that declining payables were driven by sustained client movement toward higher-yielding alternatives amid rising rates. The multi-year decline indicates a structural shift in client behavior, not just a temporary market response.",

Accelerated premium amortization stemming from elevated prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities in the AFS portfolio continued in 2021 and partially offset the growth in net interest revenue. Net premium amortization of investment securities totaled $2.3 billion in 2021 and $1.6 billion in 2020. TD Ameritrade contributed total net interest revenue of $1.9 billion during the year ended December 31, 2021 and $443 million in 2020 from October 6, through December 31, 2020.\n\nAverage interest-earning assets for 2021 were higher by 46%, compared to 2020. This increase was largely due to higher bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, which resulted from strong net new client asset inflows, continued heightened client cash allocations driven by the low interest rate environment, BDA balance migrations, and the inclusion of TD Ameritrade for all of 2021.\n\nOur net interest margin declined to 1.45% in 2021, from 1.62% in 2020. This decrease was driven primarily by lower overall yields received on interest-earning assets, in part due to purchases of investment securities in 2020 and 2021 at rates below the average yield on the AFS portfolio. This more than offset the benefit of increased securities lending revenue and higher margin utilization in 2021, which comprised 39% of net interest revenue during 2021, growing from 19% of net interest revenue in 2020.\n\nNet interest revenue decreased $403 million, or 6%, in 2020 from 2019, due primarily to lower average investment yields, partially offset by growth in interest-earning assets and our acquisition of TD Ameritrade. Accelerated premium amortization on debt securities in 2020 also contributed to the reduction in net interest revenue, as the decline in long-term interest rates in 2020 resulted in higher prepayments of mortgage-related debt securities. Average interest-earning assets for 2020 were higher by 40%, compared to 2019. This increase in average interest-earning assets was primarily driven by higher client cash balances in bank deposits and payables to brokerage clients, due to higher client cash allocations and our acquisitions of TD Ameritrade and assets of USAAIMCO. TD Ameritrade contributed approximately $12.0 billion of average interest-earning assets and $9.6 billion of average interest-bearing liabilities to Schwab's full-year 2020 averages.\n\nOur net interest margin decreased to 1.62% in 2020, from 2.41% in 2019. This decrease was driven primarily by lower yields received on interest-earning assets due largely to the Federal Reserve's 2019 and 2020 interest rate reductions as well as higher premium amortization on mortgage-related debt securities. Due to the low interest rate environment, purchases of investment securities in 2020 were made at rates below the average yield on the existing AFS portfolio, which negatively impacted our net interest margin.\n\n## Asset Management and Administration Fees\n\nAsset management and administration fees include mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees and fees for other asset-based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. Schwab earns mutual fund, ETF, and CTF service fees for shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third-party funds.

Other asset management and administration fees include various asset-based fees such as trust fees, 401(k) recordkeeping fees, mutual fund clearing fees, and non-balance based service and transaction fees. Asset management and administration fees attributable to TD Ameritrade are primarily earned on client assets invested in money market mutual funds and other mutual funds, as well as advice solutions.\n\nAsset management and administration fees vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Schwab assumed $97.4 billion in payables to brokerage clients as part of its acquisition, indicating a high level of client cash held. By 2023, this liability had decreased to $84.8 billion, reflecting clients reallocating cash out of sweep products into higher-yielding investment solutions in response to rising interest rates. This shift led to a 21% decline in average interest-earning assets compared to 2022, which, along with increased use of higher-cost funding sources, contributed to a $1.3 billion (12%) decrease in net interest revenue in 2023. While the net interest margin improved to 1.98% in 2023 from 1.78% in 2022 due to higher yields, the drop in payables signaled a structural change in client cash retention, forcing Schwab to adapt its funding cost optimization strategy in a rising rate environment.",

      "question": "How did the dynamics of Schwab's payables to brokerage clients evolve from 2022 to 2024, particularly in terms of their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet size, and what does this reveal about client cash allocation behavior in response to rising interest rates?",
      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Schwab's payables to brokerage clients declined significantly as clients moved cash out of sweep products into higher-yielding investments due to rising interest rates. In 2022, payables were a core component of Schwab's interest-bearing liabilities and a key source of funding for interest-earning assets. By 2023, these liabilities had decreased by $89.4 billion (19%), contributing to a 21% drop in average interest-earning assets year-over-year. In 2024, this trend continued to negatively impact net interest revenue, which fell by $1.3 billion (12%) in 2023 compared to 2022, despite higher yields on assets. The reduction in payables reflects a broader client shift toward yield optimization, altering Schwab\u2019s funding structure and affecting its net interest margin and overall balance sheet size.",

Percentage changes greater than 200% are presented as not meaningful.\n\n## Net Interest Revenue\n\nSchwab's primary interest-earning assets include cash and cash equivalents; cash and investments segregated; margin loans, which constitute the majority of receivables from brokerage clients; investment securities; and bank loans. Revenue on interest-earning assets is affected by various factors, such as the composition of assets, prevailing interest rates and spreads at the time of origination or purchase, changes in interest rates on floating rate securities and loans, and changes in prepayment levels for mortgage-backed and other asset-backed securities and loans. Fees earned and expenses incurred on securities lending and borrowing activities are conducted by our broker-dealer subsidiaries using assets held in client brokerage accounts.\n\nSchwab's interest-bearing liabilities include bank deposits, payables to brokerage clients, short-term borrowings (e.g., Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances, commercial paper, secured borrowings by our broker-dealer subsidiaries, repurchase agreements), and long-term debt. Schwab deploys the funds from these sources into the assets outlined above. As Schwab builds its client base, we attract new client sweep cash, which is a primary driver of funding balance sheet growth. We do not use short-term, wholesale borrowings to support our long-term investment activity, but may use such funding for short-term liquidity purposes or to provide temporary funding. Non-interest-bearing funding sources include stockholders' equity, certain client cash balances, and other miscellaneous liabilities.",
