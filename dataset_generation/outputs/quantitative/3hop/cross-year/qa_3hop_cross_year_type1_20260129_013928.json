      "question": "How did Caterpillar's exposure to the Mining segment through non-accrual receivables without an allowance change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about their credit risk management in this sector?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar reported $11 million in pre-TDR amortized cost for the Mining segment, with $1 million classified as non-accrual without an allowance. By 2023, the non-accrual without an allowance for Mining dropped to $0, while the non-accrual with an allowance was reduced to $2 million. This indicates a significant improvement in credit risk management for the Mining segment, as Caterpillar either collected previously delinquent receivables or adjusted its allowance strategy, reducing direct exposure to non-accrual risk in this sector.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM's operating income margins were negatively impacted by rising raw materials and logistics costs, which were not offset by sales growth or restructuring actions, leading to a year-on-year margin decline. By 2023, while inflation and supply chain pressures persisted, the company demonstrated strong spending discipline\u2014highlighted by restructuring actions and cost controls\u2014which partially offset these headwinds. This shift indicates that MMM evolved from being constrained by external cost pressures in 2022 to actively managing internal cost structures in 2023 to protect margins.",

Cat  Financial  leases  to  customers  primarily  through  sales-type  (non-tax)  leases,  where  the  lessee  for  tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the  lease.  For  tax  purposes,  Cat  Financial  is  considered  the  owner  of  the  equipment.  Our  lease  agreements  may  include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fixed price or fair market value.\n\nWe determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale  market  sales  prices,  past  remarketing  experience  and  any  known  significant  market/product  trends.    We  also consider  the  following  critical  factors  in  our  residual  value  estimates:  lease  term,  market  size  and  demand,  total  expected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nDuring  the  term  of  our  leases,  we  monitor  residual  values.    For  operating  leases,  we  record  adjustments  to  depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\n\nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## C. Allowance for credit losses\n\n## Portfolio segments\n\nA portfolio segment is the level at which Cat Financial develops a systematic methodology for determining its allowance for credit losses. Cat Financial's portfolio segments and related methods for estimating expected credit losses are as follows:\n\n## Customer\n\nCat  Financial  provides  loans  and  finance  leases  to  end-user  customers  primarily  for  the  purpose  of  financing  new  and  used Caterpillar  machinery,  engines  and  equipment  for  commercial  use,  the  majority  of  which  operate  in  construction-related industries. Cat Financial also provides financing for vehicles, power generation facilities and marine vessels that, in most cases, incorporate  Caterpillar  products.  The  average  original  term  of  Cat  Financial's  customer  finance  receivable  portfolio  was approximately 50 months with an average remaining term of approximately 27 months as of December 31, 2021.\n\nCat Financial typically maintains a security interest in financed equipment and requires physical damage insurance coverage on the  financed equipment, both of which provide Cat Financial with certain rights and protections. If Cat Financial's collection efforts fail to bring a defaulted account current, Cat Financial generally can repossess the financed equipment, after satisfying local legal requirements, and sell it within the Caterpillar dealer network or through third-party auctions.\n\nCat Financial estimates the allowance for credit losses related to its customer finance receivables based on loss forecast models utilizing probabilities of default and the estimated loss given default based on past loss experience adjusted for current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts capturing country and industry-specific economic factors.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Cat Financial's forecasts for the markets in which it operates reflected a general improvement  in  economic  conditions,  which  had  deteriorated  due  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  resulting  from  a  growing economy,  improved  unemployment  rates  and  a  decrease  in  delinquencies.  The  company  believes  the  economic  forecasts employed represent reasonable and supportable forecasts, followed by a reversion to long-term trends.\n\n## Dealer\n\nCat  Financial  provides  financing  to  Caterpillar  dealers  in  the  form  of  wholesale  financing  plans.  Cat  Financial's  wholesale financing plans provide assistance to dealers by financing their mostly new Caterpillar equipment inventory and rental fleets on a secured and unsecured basis. In addition, Cat Financial provides a variety of secured and unsecured loans to Caterpillar dealers.\n\nCat  Financial  estimates  the  allowance  for  credit  losses  for  dealer  finance  receivables  based  on  historical  loss  rates  with consideration of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.\n\nIn general, Cat Financial's Dealer portfolio segment has not historically experienced large increases or decreases in credit losses based on changes in economic conditions due to its close working relationships with the dealers and their financial strength. Therefore, Cat Financial made no adjustments to historical loss rates during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\n## Classes of finance receivables\n\nCat Financial further evaluates portfolio segments by the class of finance receivables, which is defined as a level of information (below a portfolio segment) in which the finance receivables have the same initial measurement attribute and a similar method for assessing and monitoring credit risk. Cat Financial's classes, which align with management reporting for credit losses, are as follows:\n\n- North America - Finance receivables originated in the United States and Canada.\n- EAME -  Finance  receivables  originated  in  Europe,  Africa,  the  Middle  East  and  the  Commonwealth  of Independent States.\n- Asia/Pacific - Finance receivables originated in Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, Southeast Asia and India.\n- Mining - Finance receivables related to large mining customers worldwide.\n- Latin America - Finance receivables originated in Mexico and Central and South American countries.\n- Caterpillar Power Finance - Finance receivables originated worldwide related to marine vessels with Caterpillar engines  and  Caterpillar  electrical  power  generation,  gas  compression  and  co-generation  systems  and  nonCaterpillar equipment that is powered by these systems.",

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX reported a total cost of sales of $56.8 billion, which set the baseline for the following year's cost structure. In 2024, the total cost of sales increased by $6.2 billion organically, with a significant portion attributed to the Collins segment's net sales growth. This indicates that the Collins segment, which was already a major contributor to RTX's cost of sales in 2023, experienced further expansion in 2024, directly driving up the company's overall cost of sales. The evolution from 2023 to 2024 shows a continuation and intensification of Collins' impact on RTX's cost structure.",

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX cited high inflation levels as a key factor increasing material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs, which negatively impacted operating profit and margin, particularly on fixed-price contracts where cost overruns could not be offset by price increases. This inflationary pressure carried into 2024, where supplier cost pressures persisted, affecting production flow and performance on customer commitments. The continued high supplier costs in 2024, stemming from the inflationary environment of 2023, led to increased risk of losses on fixed-price contracts, as RTX was unable to fully recover rising input costs through contract re-pricing.",

Any such attacks could disrupt our systems  or  those  of  third  parties  (including  mission  and  safety  critical  systems),  impact  business  operations,  result  in  unauthorized  release  of  confidential, proprietary, or otherwise protected information, and corrupt our data or that of third parties. The threats we face are continuous and evolving, and vary in degree of severity and sophistication. These threats include advanced persistent threats from highly organized adversaries, including but not limited to cyber criminals, nation states, and so-called hacktivists, particularly those adverse to the security interests of the U.S. and its allies, which target us and other defense contractors. These types of threats are related to the geopolitical environment and have, therefore, grown in number due to recent geopolitical conflicts. In addition, as a result of the rapid pace of technological change, we and our customers, suppliers, subcontractors, and other third parties with whom we conduct business continue to rely on legacy systems and software, which can be more vulnerable to cyber threats and attacks. Moreover, we, like other companies, are seeing an unprecedented number of previously unknown vulnerabilities, for which there are no known mitigations, being revealed by new attacks. Further, the sophistication, availability, and use of artificial  intelligence  by  threat  actors  present  an  increased  level  of  risk.  Due  to  the  evolving  threat  landscape,  we  have  ex perienced  and  ex pect  to  continue  to experience more frequent and increasingly advanced cyber-attacks. In addition, changes in domestic and international cybersecurity-related laws and regulations have expanded cybersecurity-related compliance requirements, and cybersecurity regulatory enforcement activity has grown. We expect the regulatory environment to continue to evolve, and these regulatory changes could increase our operational and compliance expenditures and those of our suppliers, and lead to new or additional IT and product development expenses. We also face reputational, litigation, and financial risks in relation to potential required disclosures and increased risk of enforcement. We continue to make investments and adopt measures designed to enhance our protection, detection, response, and recovery capabilities, and to mitigate potential risks to our technology, products, services, and operations from potential cybersecurity threats, as well as to comply with evolving regulations. However,  given  the  unpredictability,  nature,  and  scope  of  cyber-attacks,  it  is  possible  that  we  are  unable  to  defend  against  all  cyber-attacks,  that  potential vulnerabilities could go undetected and persist in the environment for an extended period, or that we may otherwise be unable to mitigate customer losses and other potential consequences of these attacks. In addition, some products and services that we provide to customers, particularly those related to public security, may raise  potential  liabilities  related  to  privacy  and  intellectual  property.  In  some  cases,  we  must  rely  on  the  safeguards  put  in  place  by  our  customers,  suppliers, subcontractors, and other third parties to protect against and report cyber threats and attacks. We could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays,  other  detrimental  impacts  on  our  operations,  or  ability  to  provide  products  and  services  to  our  customers,  the  compromise  of  confidential  information, intellectual property or otherwise protected information, misappropriation, destruction, or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our or third-party systems, networks, or products, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, penalties, fines, and/or damage to our reputation. Any of these could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. Due to the evolving nature  of  such  risks,  the  impact  of  any  potential  incident  cannot  be  predicted.  Further,  our  insurance  coverage,  which  may  ex clude  losses  from  war  or  cyber operations, may not be adequate to cover all related costs and we may not otherwise be fully indemnified for them.\n\nWe are dependent on a global supply chain and subject to risks related to the availability of materials and the performance of our suppliers; in recent years we have experienced supply chain disruptions that resulted in delays and increased costs and adversely affected our performance. Our performance requires a variety of raw materials, supplier-provided parts, components, sub-systems, and contract manufacturing services, and we rely on U.S. and non-U.S. suppliers (including third-party manufacturing suppliers, subcontractors, and service providers) and commodity markets for these materials and services. In some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply, manufacturing, services support, or assembly, or participate in commodity markets that may be subject to allocations of limited supplies by suppliers. Emerging laws and increasing regulatory requirements aimed at global supply chains may impact our ability to access certain materials and components, and otherwise adversely affect our business, and we may not only be held responsible for our compliance, but for that of our suppliers. In addition, our defense businesses are subject to specific procurement requirements that limit the types of materials they use. Our defense businesses also must require suppliers to comply with various DoD requirements, any of which requirements may further limit the suppliers and subcontractors they may utilize. Identifying and qualifying second- or third- source suppliers can be difficult, time-consuming, and may result in increased costs.\n\nIn recent years, global supply chain disruptions have impacted our ability to procure raw materials, microelectronics, and certain commodities. These disruptions were driven by supply chain market constraints and macroeconomic conditions, including inflation and labor market shortages. Current geopolitical conditions, including conflicts and other causes of strained intercountry relations, as well as sanctions and other trade restrictive activities, have contributed to these issues. In addition, the inflationary environment has increased material and component prices, labor rates, and supplier costs, and negatively impacted costs. Credit market conditions, including higher interest rates and the availability of credit, have impacted some of our suppliers and subcontractors as well. As a result of these procurement issues, the  production  flow  in  our  factories  has  been  negatively  impacted,  which  has,  in  turn,  hindered  our  ability  to  perform  on  our  commitments  to  customers  and negatively",

      "question": "How did MMM's strategic focus on Advanced Materials in 2022 relate to the performance of the Transportation and Electronics segment in 2023, particularly in terms of organic sales decline and the impact of exiting PFAS manufacturing?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MMM identified Advanced Materials as one of its key reporting units, accounting for a significant portion of the company's goodwill within the Transportation and Electronics business. However, due to MMM's strategic decision to exit PFAS manufacturing, a goodwill impairment charge was recorded for the Advanced Materials reporting unit within Transportation and Electronics. By 2023, the Transportation and Electronics segment reported a 3.5% decline in organic sales, which was partially attributed to the exit from PFAS manufacturing. This indicates that the impairment and strategic pivot away from certain advanced materials in 2022 directly influenced the segment's performance in 2023, contributing to the decline in organic growth despite modest gains from acquisitions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nto the separate fourth quarter 2021 annual impairment test and is in the context of the reporting unit structure that existed at that time.\n\nBased on the annual test in the fourth quarter of 2021, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units. As of October 1, 2021, 3M had 22 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 94 percent of the goodwill. These ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: Advanced Materials, Display Materials and Systems, Electronics Materials Solutions, Health Information Systems, Industrial Adhesives and Tapes, Medical Solutions, Oral Care, Personal Safety, Separation and Purification Sciences, and Transportation Safety.\n\n3M is a highly integrated enterprise, where businesses share technology and leverage common fundamental strengths and capabilities, thus many of 3M's businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. 3M's focus on research and development has resulted in a portion of 3M's value being comprised of internally developed businesses.\n\n3M will continue to monitor its reporting units and asset groups in 2022 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.\n\n## Uncertainty in Income Tax Positions:\n\nThe extent of 3M's operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. The final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. The Company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the United States and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. The Company follows guidance provided by ASC 740, Income Taxes , a subset of which relates to uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to Note 10 for additional information). The Company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the Company's current estimate of the tax liabilities. If the Company's estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. If payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the Company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.\n\n## NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\n\nInformation regarding new accounting pronouncements is included in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\n\nThe strength and stability of 3M's business model and strong free cash flow capability, together with proven capital markets access, provides financial flexibility and enables the Company to invest through business cycles. Investing in 3M's business to drive organic growth and deliver strong returns on invested capital remains the first priority for capital deployment. This includes research and development, capital expenditures, and commercialization capability. The Company also continues to actively manage its portfolio through acquisitions and divestitures to maximize value for shareholders. 3M expects to continue returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. To fund cash needs in the United States, the Company relies on ongoing cash flow from U.S. operations, access to capital markets and repatriation of the earnings of its foreign affiliates that are not considered to be permanently reinvested. For those international earnings still considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the Company currently has no plans or intentions to repatriate these funds for U.S. operations. See Note 10 for further information on earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely.\n\n3M maintains a strong liquidity profile. The company's primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand and U.S. commercial paper issuances. 3M believes it will have continuous access to the commercial paper market. 3M's commercial paper program permits the Company to have a maximum of $5 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. At December 31, 2021, there was no commercial paper issued and outstanding.\n\n## Total Debt:\n\nThe strength of 3M's credit profile and significant ongoing cash flows provide 3M proven access to capital markets. Additionally, the Company's debt maturity profile is staggered to help ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. 3M currently has an A1 credit rating with a negative outlook from Moody's Investors Service and an A+ credit rating with negative outlook from Standard and Poor's.",

By 2024, the Mining segment's overall receivables had remained relatively stable at $14 million, but the '91+ Still Accruing' category appears to have been resolved or reclassified, as it is no longer explicitly listed in the 2024 breakdown.

      "answer": "In 2023, CAT reported $2 million in non-accrual receivables without an allowance specifically for the Mining segment, while in 2024, this figure increased to $8 million. This indicates a significant rise in credit risk exposure for CAT within the Mining segment over the year. The connection between non-accrual receivables without an allowance and the Mining segment suggests that CAT faced greater difficulty in collecting receivables from mining clients in 2024 compared to 2023, potentially signaling financial stress among its mining customers or a strategic shift in credit policies.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT(2023) \u2192 Non-accrual Without an Allowance: In 2023, CAT disclosed $2 million in non-accrual receivables without an allowance for the Mining segment.",
        "Hop 2: Non-accrual Without an Allowance \u2192 Mining: The Mining segment is directly associated with this category of receivables, indicating credit risk tied to mining clients.",
        "Hop 3: Mining \u2190 CAT(2024): By 2024, CAT's Mining segment had $8 million in non-accrual receivables without an allowance, showing a fourfold increase in credit risk exposure."

      "answer": "The consolidation of FedEx Ground into Federal Express in June 2024 coincided with a 1% increase in Average Daily Volume during 2024, primarily driven by increased demand for commercial and economy services. This reflects the strategic integration of surface operations into the broader FedEx network, aiming to enhance operational efficiency and unify the air-ground express system under a single brand.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\n\n## ORGANIZATION OF INFORMATION\n\nThis Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition ('MD&amp;A') of FedEx Corporation ('FedEx') is composed of three major sections: Results of Operations and Outlook, Financial Condition, and Critical Accounting Estimates. These sections include the following information:\n\n- \u00b7Results of operations includes an overview of our consolidated 2024 results compared to 2023 results. This section also includes a discussion of key actions and events that impacted our results. Discussion and analysis of 2022 results and year-over-year comparisons between 2023 results and 2022 results can be found in 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of our Annual Report on Form 10-K ('Annual Report') for the year ended May 31, 2023.\n- \u00b7The overview is followed by a discussion of both historical operating results for our business segments in place during 2024 and 2023 and our outlook for 2025, as well as a financial summary and analysis for each of our transportation segments in place during 2024 and 2023.\n- \u00b7Our financial condition is reviewed through an analysis of key elements of our liquidity and capital resources, financial commitments, and liquidity outlook for 2025.\n- \u00b7Critical accounting estimates discusses those financial statement elements that we believe are most important to understanding the material judgments and assumptions incorporated in our financial results.\n\nThe discussion in MD&amp;A should be read in conjunction with the other sections of this Annual Report, particularly 'Item 1. Business,' 'Item 1A. Risk Factors,' and 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.'\n\n## DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS SEGMENTS\n\nWe provide a broad portfolio of transportation, e-commerce, and business services, offering integrated business solutions utilizing our flexible, efficient, and intelligent global network. During 2024 and 2023, our primary operating companies were Federal Express Corporation ('FedEx Express'), the world's largest express transportation company; FedEx Ground Package System, Inc. ('FedEx Ground'), a leading North American provider of small-package ground delivery services; and FedEx Freight Corporation and its less-than-truckload ('LTL') operating subsidiary FedEx Freight, Inc. ('FedEx Freight'), a leading North American provider of LTL freight transportation services. For these periods, those companies represented our major service lines and, along with FedEx Corporate Services, Inc. ('FedEx Services'), constituted our reportable segments. Our FedEx Services segment provided sales, marketing, information technology, communications, customer service, technical support, billing and collection services, and certain back-office functions that supported our operating segments. The operating costs of the FedEx Services segment were allocated to the business units it served during 2024 and 2023.\n\nThis MD&amp;A is based on our segment reporting that was in effect during 2024 and 2023. In connection with our one FedEx consolidation, on June 1, 2024, FedEx Ground and FedEx Services were merged into Federal Express Corporation ('Federal Express'), becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated airground express network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight continues to provide LTL freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. Beginning in the first quarter of 2025, Federal Ex press and FedEx  Freight represent our major service lines and constitute our reportable segments. Additionally, the results of FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. ('FedEx Custom Critical') will be included in the FedEx Freight segment instead of the Federal Express segment in 2025. Prior-year amounts will be revised to reflect this presentation. See 'Reportable Segments' below and 'Item 1. Business' for additional information.\n\nThe key indicators necessary to understand our operating results include:\n\n\u2022the overall customer demand for our various services based on macroeconomic factors and the global economy;\n\n- \u2022the volumes of transportation services provided through our networks, primarily measured by our average daily volume and shipment weight and size;\n- \u2022the mix of services purchased by our customers;\n- \u00b7the prices we obtain for our services, primarily measured by yield (revenue per package or pound or revenue per shipment or hundredweight for LTL freight shipments);\n\n\u2022our ability to manage our cost structure (capital ex penditures and operating ex penses) to match shifting volume levels; and",

      "answer": "The integration of FedEx Ground into Federal Express in 2024 contributed to a strategic alignment that enhanced cost efficiencies, particularly in transportation logistics. This integration supported a 3% decrease in Purchased Transportation Expense, driven by lower fuel prices and increased third-party rail usage. These cost savings, combined with yield improvements and higher volumes, helped FedEx Ground achieve a 29% increase in operating income. The consolidation of operations under Federal Express allowed for better network optimization, including linehaul efficiencies and dock productivity, which further supported the reduction in transportation costs.",

FedEx Ground yield increased 1% in 2024 primarily due to base yield improvement, partially offset by lower fuel surcharges. Total average daily volume increased 1% in 2024 primarily due to increased demand for our commercial and economy services.\n\n## FedEx Ground Segment Operating Income\n\nFedEx Ground segment operating income increased 29% in 2024 primarily due to yield improvement, higher volume, lower self-insurance accruals, and lower purchased transportation expense. FedEx Ground lowered operating costs in 2024 through continued benefits from DRIVE initiatives focused on increasing linehaul efficiencies and improving dock productivity. In addition, FedEx Ground continued to realize benefits from reduced Sunday deliveries and consolidated sort operations in 2024.\n\nPurchased transportation expense decreased 3% in 2024 primarily due to lower fuel prices and increased third-party rail usage, partially offset by higher base rates. Other operating expense decreased 5% in 2024 primarily due to lower self-insurance accruals. Depreciation and rentals expense increased 10% and 4%, respectively, in 2024 primarily due to the completion of previously committed multi-year expansion projects. Maintenance and repairs expense increased 10% in 2024 primarily due to higher costs associated with outside vendor labor, vehicle parts, and facility maintenance. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 1% in 2024 primarily due to higher wage rates and variable incentive compensation, partially offset by an increase in productivity.\n\nFedEx Ground results include business optimization costs of $108 million in 2024 associated with our plan to drive efficiency and lower our overhead and support costs.

      "answer": "In 2022, the FedEx Express segment accounted for $3,637 million, or approximately 54% of the consolidated total capital expenditures of $6,763 million. By 2024, this contribution decreased to $3,291 million, or about 64% of the consolidated total of $5,176 million. Despite the dollar amount declining, the segment's proportion of the total increased, suggesting a strategic refocusing or efficiency drive in capital allocation. This shift indicates a transformation in the entity chain relationship, where FedEx Express became relatively more prominent within the company's overall capital investment strategy.",

In 2024, this shifted to a total pretax gain of $107 million, primarily due to a $108 million gain from foreign currency denominated debt, while foreign currency forward/option contracts contributed a negligible $1 million loss.

      "answer": "In 2023, Pratt & Whitney contributed $18,296 million to RTX's consolidated net sales, indicating its significant role in the company's revenue base. However, by 2024, this segment faced a material credit risk event due to a customer bankruptcy in the fourth quarter, which led to a sharp increase in RTX's allowance for expected credit losses\u2014from $197 million in 2023 to $491 million by December 31, 2024. This suggests that the weakening financial health of Pratt & Whitney's customers directly translated into increased risk for RTX as a whole, highlighting how a decline in segment performance can cascade into broader financial risk for the parent company.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Caterpillar highlighted its reliance on Cat Financial's credit facilities, with consolidated credit lines totaling $4.16 billion, which were critical for subsidiaries' funding needs and financial resilience during economic downturns. Cat Financial monitored credit quality based on past-due status, considering any installment over 30 days past due as fully delinquent. In 2024, Cat Financial continued to emphasize past-due status as a key metric for assessing credit risk, indicating a consistent approach to monitoring receivables. However, the continued emphasis on past-due status in 2024 suggests that Caterpillar's reliance on Cat Financial's credit infrastructure remained significant, with no indication of a strategic shift in how credit risk was managed year-over-year.",

However, following the 2023 separation, GE acknowledged that as a smaller, less diversified company, its ability to execute capital allocation plans\u2014such as funding capital expenditures, paying dividends, and meeting debt obligations\u2014was diminished due to reduced diversification of cash flows and increased volatility. In 2023, GE noted that it might adopt changes to its capital allocation plans, including adjustments to the timing or amounts of investments, share repurchases, or dividends, in response to liquidity pressures or unforeseen capital needs. This reflects a shift from the 2022 position, where the company was still operating as a diversified conglomerate with more flexibility in managing its capital structure.",

Specifically, we now consistently present sales of spare parts used in a service arrangement as part of Sales of services and the related costs as Costs of services sold. See Note 1 for further information.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS. GE announced it plans to form three public companies focused on the growth sectors of aviation, healthcare and energy . In November 2021, we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from our (i) Aviation business, (ii) Healthcare business and (iii) Renewable Energy, Power and Digital businesses that we will combine. We intend to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Healthcare in early 2023, creating a pure play company at the center of precision health, and we expect to retain a stake of 19.9% in the new company. We intend to pursue a taxfree spin-off of the combined Renewable Energy, Power and Digital businesses in early 2024, and that new company will be positioned to lead the energy transition. Following these transactions, GE will be an aviation-focused company, shaping the future of flight. As independently run companies, each can benefit from greater focus, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors and employees. The respective capital structures, brands and leadership teams for each independent company will be determined and announced later.\n\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic . The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economies, resulting in workforce and travel restrictions, supply chain and production disruptions and reduced demand and spending across many sectors. Since the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, these factors have had a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. While factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic have been impacting operations and financial performance at varying levels across all our businesses, the most significant impact to date has been at our Aviation segment. For details about impacts related to our businesses and actions we have taken in response, as applicable, refer to the respective segment sections within MD&amp;A. We anticipate that our operations and financial performance will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in future periods. These impacts will ultimately depend on many factors that are not within our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; the emergence of COVID-19 virus variants; and the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines.\n\nGECAS . On November 1, 2021, we completed the combination of our GECAS business with AerCap and received $22.6 billion in cash, subject to future closing adjustments, 111.5 million shares of AerCap common stock (approximately 46% ownership interest) valued at approximately $6.6 billion based on AerCap's closing share price on October 29, 2021, and a $1.0 billion AerCap senior note. In connection with the closing of the transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash after-tax charge of $3.9 billion in discontinued operations in 2021, including a loss of $0.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we have elected to prospectively measure our investment in AerCap at fair value and expect to have continuing involvement with AerCap, primarily through our ownership interest and ongoing sales or leases of products and services. We expect to fully monetize our stake in AerCap over time. See Notes 2 and 3 for further information.\n\nLiability Management Actions. During 2021, we completed debt tenders to repurchase a total of $32.6 billion of debt, comprising $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. The total after-tax loss on these actions was $6.1 billion ($6.5 billion pre-tax), comprising an after-tax loss of $1.1 billion ($1.4 billion pre-tax) in the second quarter of 2021 and an after-tax loss of $5.0 billion ($5.1 billion pre-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2021. The majority of the loss relates to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the debt. As a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward.\n\nFactoring . Effective April 1, 2021, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we subsequently discontinued our remaining unconsolidated receivables facility. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the adverse impact to GE businesses' cash flows from operating activities (CFOA) was $5.1 billion, including $1.6 billion related to the unconsolidated receivables facility in the fourth quarter, which primarily represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the period had customer receivables not been previously sold and is excluded from free cash flows*. The adverse CFOA impact associated with activity in factoring programs that have now been discontinued was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nReverse Stock Split. In the second quarter of 2021, we announced that we would proceed with the 1-for-8 reverse stock split, as approved by shareholders, and filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effectuate the reverse stock split after the close of trading on July 30, 2021. GE common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 2, 2021. Our shares of outstanding common stock and earnings per share calculation have been retroactively restated for all periods presented.\n\nBK Medical. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired BK Medical, a leader in surgical ultrasound imaging and guidance, from Altaris Capital Partners for a cash purchase price of $1.5 billion.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing reported a Loss from Operations (GAAP) of $773 million, with Unallocated Items totaling $1,759 million. By 2024, Unallocated Items increased to $2,047 million, contributing to a significantly worse Loss from Operations (GAAP) of $10,707 million. The escalation in Unallocated Items reflects growing unassigned costs or adjustments that are not tied to specific business segments, thereby worsening the overall GAAP operating loss. This trend indicates a growing burden of corporate-level expenses or restructuring impacts that negatively impacted financial performance year-over-year.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Caterpillar reported that no cash collateral was received or pledged under ISDA master netting agreements within ME&T and Financial Products. This same condition persisted in 2024, where the company again disclosed that as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no cash collateral was received or pledged under these agreements. Despite the absence of cash collateral requirements, the exposure to credit loss in the event of counterparty nonperformance remained limited to unrealized gains.

Under these master netting agreements, net settlement generally permits the company or the counterparty to determine the net amount payable for contracts due on the same date and in the same currency for similar types of derivative transactions. The master netting agreements may also provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment.\n\nCollateral is typically not required of the counterparties or of our company under the master netting agreements. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, no cash collateral was received or pledged under the master netting agreements.\n\nThe effect of the net settlement provisions of the master netting agreements on our derivative balances upon an event of default or termination event was as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the change in CAT's revolving finance receivables exposure to the mining sector between 2023 and 2024 impact the company's overall financial receivables performance in that segment?",
      "answer": "In 2023, CAT reported $80 million in revolving finance receivables tied to the mining sector, which was part of a larger $2,110 million total finance receivables for that segment. By 2024, the company's revolving finance receivables exposure to mining dropped to $8 million, while total receivables in the mining segment increased slightly to $14 million. This indicates a significant reduction in the company's reliance on revolving credit structures within mining, potentially signaling tighter credit controls or a strategic shift in financing arrangements. The drop in revolving receivables coincided with a broader decline in total finance receivables across all segments, suggesting a company-wide tightening of credit policies or reduced financing activity.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT(2023) \u2192 Revolving Finance Receivables: In 2023, CAT disclosed $80 million in revolving finance receivables specifically tied to the mining segment.",
        "Hop 2: Revolving Finance Receivables \u2192 Mining: The mining segment had a total of $2,110 million in finance receivables in 2023, with a small portion ($80 million) being revolving, indicating a reliance on flexible credit structures.",
        "Hop 3: Mining \u2190 CAT(2024): By 2024, the mining segment's total finance receivables dropped to $14 million, with only $8 million attributed to revolving finance receivables, showing a major shift in credit exposure."

      "answer": "In 2022, GE planned to spin off GE HealthCare in a tax-free transaction, retaining a 19.9% stake (from hop1_evidence). By 2023 (as reflected in the 2024 filing), GE HealthCare was fully spun off, and the Earnings (Loss) of Discontinued Operations Before Income Taxes for GE HealthCare showed a shift from a $2,350 million gain in 2022 to a $50 million loss in 2023 (from hop2_evidence and hop3_evidence). This significant decline indicates the financial impact of finalizing the spin-off, as the previously profitable segment transitioned into a discontinued operation, incurring costs and adjustments associated with separation and restructuring.",

Specifically, we now consistently present sales of spare parts used in a service arrangement as part of Sales of services and the related costs as Costs of services sold. See Note 1 for further information.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n\nSIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENTS. GE announced it plans to form three public companies focused on the growth sectors of aviation, healthcare and energy . In November 2021, we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from our (i) Aviation business, (ii) Healthcare business and (iii) Renewable Energy, Power and Digital businesses that we will combine. We intend to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Healthcare in early 2023, creating a pure play company at the center of precision health, and we expect to retain a stake of 19.9% in the new company. We intend to pursue a taxfree spin-off of the combined Renewable Energy, Power and Digital businesses in early 2024, and that new company will be positioned to lead the energy transition. Following these transactions, GE will be an aviation-focused company, shaping the future of flight. As independently run companies, each can benefit from greater focus, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors and employees. The respective capital structures, brands and leadership teams for each independent company will be determined and announced later.\n\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic . The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economies, resulting in workforce and travel restrictions, supply chain and production disruptions and reduced demand and spending across many sectors. Since the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, these factors have had a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. While factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic have been impacting operations and financial performance at varying levels across all our businesses, the most significant impact to date has been at our Aviation segment. For details about impacts related to our businesses and actions we have taken in response, as applicable, refer to the respective segment sections within MD&amp;A. We anticipate that our operations and financial performance will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in future periods. These impacts will ultimately depend on many factors that are not within our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; the emergence of COVID-19 virus variants; and the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines.\n\nGECAS . On November 1, 2021, we completed the combination of our GECAS business with AerCap and received $22.6 billion in cash, subject to future closing adjustments, 111.5 million shares of AerCap common stock (approximately 46% ownership interest) valued at approximately $6.6 billion based on AerCap's closing share price on October 29, 2021, and a $1.0 billion AerCap senior note. In connection with the closing of the transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash after-tax charge of $3.9 billion in discontinued operations in 2021, including a loss of $0.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we have elected to prospectively measure our investment in AerCap at fair value and expect to have continuing involvement with AerCap, primarily through our ownership interest and ongoing sales or leases of products and services. We expect to fully monetize our stake in AerCap over time. See Notes 2 and 3 for further information.\n\nLiability Management Actions. During 2021, we completed debt tenders to repurchase a total of $32.6 billion of debt, comprising $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. The total after-tax loss on these actions was $6.1 billion ($6.5 billion pre-tax), comprising an after-tax loss of $1.1 billion ($1.4 billion pre-tax) in the second quarter of 2021 and an after-tax loss of $5.0 billion ($5.1 billion pre-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2021. The majority of the loss relates to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the debt. As a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward.\n\nFactoring . Effective April 1, 2021, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we subsequently discontinued our remaining unconsolidated receivables facility. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the adverse impact to GE businesses' cash flows from operating activities (CFOA) was $5.1 billion, including $1.6 billion related to the unconsolidated receivables facility in the fourth quarter, which primarily represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the period had customer receivables not been previously sold and is excluded from free cash flows*. The adverse CFOA impact associated with activity in factoring programs that have now been discontinued was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nReverse Stock Split. In the second quarter of 2021, we announced that we would proceed with the 1-for-8 reverse stock split, as approved by shareholders, and filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effectuate the reverse stock split after the close of trading on July 30, 2021. GE common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 2, 2021. Our shares of outstanding common stock and earnings per share calculation have been retroactively restated for all periods presented.\n\nBK Medical. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired BK Medical, a leader in surgical ultrasound imaging and guidance, from Altaris Capital Partners for a cash purchase price of $1.5 billion.",

      "question": "How did the change in MMM's treatment of divestiture-related restructuring costs from 2022 to 2023 reflect a shift in how these costs were allocated between corporate special items and business segments, and what does this indicate about the company's divestiture strategy during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MMM included divestiture-related restructuring costs as part of 'special items' within Corporate and Unallocated operating income, indicating that these were considered non-recurring or strategic in nature and not directly tied to ongoing business segments. By 2023, MMM continued to classify divestiture-related restructuring costs as part of 'corporate special items', but with a notable emphasis on costs tied to the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period and the divestiture of a substantial business segment. This continuity in classification suggests that MMM maintained a centralized approach to managing divestiture-related costs, treating them as strategic corporate-level decisions rather than operational expenses borne by individual business units. The explicit mention of divestiture costs in 2023, including separation costs following a public announcement, indicates a more deliberate and large-scale divestiture strategy compared to 2022.",

        "Hop 1: MMM(2022) \u2192 Special Items: In 2022, MMM disclosed that 'special items' included divestiture-related restructuring costs, among other non-recurring charges.",

        "Hop 3: Divestiture-Related Restructuring Costs \u2190 MMM(2023): In 2023, MMM continued to include these costs in 'corporate special items', but with added specificity around costs related to a major divestiture following a public announcement, signaling a more strategic and centralized approach."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Corporate and Unallocated\n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating income includes 'special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'. Special items include significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, certain litigation and environmental expenses largely related to legacy products businesses not allocated to business segments, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former Drug Delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n## Elimination of Dual Credit\n\n3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management evaluates each of its four business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth. As a result, 3M reflects additional ('dual') credit to another business segment when the customer account activity ('sales district') with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division level. For example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the Display Materials and Systems Division within the Transportation and Electronics business segment; however, certain sales districts within the Consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Consumer) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled 'Elimination of Dual Credit,' such that sales and operating income in total are unchanged.\n\n## Geographic Information\n\nGeographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. Refer to Note 2 for geographic net sales.\n\n",

In addition, disclosures relating to 3M's business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2021, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) was updated for all comparative periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments (see Note 19 for additional details).\n\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\n\n## Corporate and Unallocated:\n\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to 'Corporate and Unallocated,' which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19.

      "answer": "In 2023, MMM's Safety and Industrial segment experienced a negative organic sales growth of 5.1% and a translation headwind of 0.5%, contributing to a total sales decline of 5.6% for that segment. This underperformance was part of a broader trend that carried into 2024, where the company's total sales change improved but still showed a decline of 1.9%, driven largely by a smaller organic sales drop of 1.2% and a modest translation impact of 0.7%. The improvement in total sales change from -5.0% in 2023 to -1.9% in 2024 suggests some stabilization, but the continued negative organic growth indicates ongoing challenges that originated in segments like Safety and Industrial.",

        "Hop 1: MMM(2023) \u2192 Safety and Industrial: MMM had a business segment structure that included Safety and Industrial, which reported a 5.1% organic sales decline and 0.5% translation impact in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: Safety and Industrial \u2192 Total Sales Change: The Safety and Industrial segment's performance contributed to MMM's overall total sales change metric, which was -5.6% in 2023.",

      "question": "How did the shift in GE's pension plan structure from 2022 to 2024 affect the overall deficit/surplus position, particularly in relation to the change in funding status for plans subject to regulatory oversight?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE reported a total pension plan deficit of $15,341 million, with $1,501 million attributed to plans subject to regulatory funding and $13,840 million to those not subject. By 2024, the overall deficit decreased to $5,548 million, with $1,134 million from plans subject to regulatory funding and $4,414 million from those not subject. This reflects a significant improvement in the funding status, particularly for regulated plans, where the deficit dropped from $1,501 million in 2022 to $1,134 million in 2024. The reduction in the deficit for plans subject to regulatory funding was driven by a decrease in the benefit obligation from $84,771 million in 2022 to $23,746 million in 2024, while the fair value of assets increased from $83,270 million to $22,612 million over the same period. This strategic shift indicates a stronger funding position for GE's core pension obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE(2022) \u2192 Total Plans: GE disclosed a total pension plan deficit of $15,341 million in 2022, with $1,501 million attributed to plans subject to regulatory funding.",
        "Hop 2: Total Plans \u2192 Deficit/(Surplus): The deficit/surplus is calculated as the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, which showed a significant deficit in 2022.",
        "Hop 3: Deficit/(Surplus) \u2190 GE(2024): By 2024, GE reported a reduced total pension plan deficit of $5,548 million, with $1,134 million attributed to plans subject to regulatory funding, indicating an improvement in the funding status."

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS reported that Revenue Per Piece increased across all customer segments, driven by base rate increases (averaging 4.9% in December 2020), fuel and demand-related surcharges, and a favorable shift in customer and product mix, particularly in the U.S. Domestic Package segment. By 2024, the U.S. Domestic Package segment remained a stable part of UPS\u2019s operations, with no goodwill impairments recorded, unlike the Supply Chain Solutions segment which saw $125 million in impairments in 2023. This suggests that the U.S. Domestic Package segment maintained strong financial health and operational performance, likely supported by the sustained revenue growth per piece and volume increases from SMBs and business-to-business shipments. The strategic focus on growing revenue per piece through pricing discipline and customer mix optimization in 2022 appears to have contributed to the segment's resilience and stability through 2024.",

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nBusiness-to-consumer shipments represented approximately 60.7% of average daily volume compared to 63.6% in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\n\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\n\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\n\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's ('DOE') Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic Air and Ground products were as follows:\n\n",

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

It also reflects the 2024 completion of purchase accounting allocations from our 2023 acquisitions of MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns, which are both reported within Supply Chain Solutions. In 2024, the decrease in goodwill balance is primarily due to the divestiture of our truckload brokerage business (\"Coyote\") within Supply Chain Solutions as discussed in note 8.\n\nThe remaining changes were due to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar on the translation of non-U.S. Dollar goodwill balances.\n\n## 2023 Goodwill Activity\n\nGoodwill acquired during 2023 was primarily associated with our acquisitions of MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns, which are both reported within Supply Chain Solutions. It also reflects the 2023 completion of purchase accounting allocations from our 2022 acquisition of Bomi Group. During 2023, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $125 million, comprised of: $56 million related to our Roadie reporting unit, $61 million related to our Delivery Solutions reporting unit, which represented all the goodwill associated with that reporting unit, and an immaterial charge resulting from the closure of a trade management services business within Supply Chain Solutions.\n\nThe remaining changes were due to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar on the translation of non-U.S. Dollar goodwill balances.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment\n\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1 on a reporting unit basis. The results concluded that the fair values of our reporting units were in excess of their respective carrying values. Approximately $1.1 billion of our consolidated goodwill balance of $4.3 billion is represented by our Global Freight Forwarding, Roadie and Global Logistics and Distribution reporting units which, based on our annual impairment evaluation, are exhibiting a limited excess of fair value above carrying value and reflect a greater risk of an impairment occurring in future periods.\n\nBased on our review of managerial realignments, which occurred as of October 1, 2024, we have determined that our MNX Global Logistics and Marken businesses are now within a single operating segment and, based on criteria in ASC Topic 350, also represent a single reporting unit. We performed impairment analyses as of October 1, 2024, reflective of our reporting unit structures before and after the reporting unit change, and did not identify any impairment of goodwill in connection therewith.\n\nWe did not record any goodwill impairment charges in the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2022. In 2023, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $125 million, as described above.\n\nCumulatively, we have recorded $1.2 billion of goodwill impairment charges in Supply Chain Solutions, while our International and U.S. Domestic Package segments have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges.",

This reduction in deficit indicates that the plan's asset growth was outpacing the growth in liabilities, at least over this one-year horizon, aligning with the long-term investment performance of the plan.",

However, these were partially offset by strong spending discipline and restructuring actions. By 2024, the impact of spending discipline had evolved into a stronger positive driver, helping margins increase year-on-year despite ongoing PFAS-related challenges and manufacturing headwinds. This reflects an evolution from a defensive posture in 2023 (where spending discipline was used to mitigate losses) to a more strategic use in 2024 (where it actively contributed to margin expansion).",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE reported a positive contribution of $3,272 million to 'Other Income, Costs and Expenses' from its discontinued operations, including GEHealthCare. By 2024, GEHealthCare had transitioned into a more defined segment role, contributing only $21 million to 'Other Income, Costs and Expenses' while GE recorded a realized and unrealized gain of $480 million from its investment in GEHealthCare. This shift indicates a strategic repositioning where GE moved from internal financial contributions through operational segments to capital gains through strategic investments, with GEHealthCare's role evolving from a cost center to a financial asset.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing reported a GAAP loss from operations of $773 million, with a Pension FAS/CAS adjustment of $799 million. By 2024, the GAAP loss from operations surged to $10,707 million, while the Pension FAS/CAS adjustment only marginally increased to $811 million. Despite the significant worsening in operational performance, the Pension FAS/CAS adjustment remained relatively stable, indicating that the pension adjustments were not sufficient to offset the dramatic increase in losses.

      "question": "How did RTX's pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) expense treatment in 2022 compare to 2024, particularly in relation to Collins Aerospace's financial reporting under FAS versus CAS standards, and what does this reveal about RTX's long-term cost recovery strategy for its defense segments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, RTX disclosed that Collins Aerospace and Pratt & Whitney generally recorded pension and PRB expenses on a FAS basis, while the Raytheon segment was primarily under U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), with a FAS/CAS operating adjustment presented outside of segment results. By 2024, this structure remained consistent, with Collins still recording pension and PRB expenses under FAS, and Raytheon under CAS, indicating RTX's ongoing strategy to align cost recovery with government contracts. This reveals a deliberate financial approach where long-term liabilities are expected to be recovered through pricing to the U.S. government, especially in defense-focused segments like Raytheon, while commercial segments like Collins maintain FAS-based reporting.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Collins contributed to an unfavorable change in net EAC adjustments, though the impact was spread across numerous programs without a single significant driver. This reflects broader execution challenges across multiple contracts during that year. By 2024, Collins again experienced unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments, but this remained relatively consistent in magnitude compared to 2023, with no single program or common cause standing out. While Pratt & Whitney saw meaningful improvement due to the absence of prior-year cost overruns from the Powder Metal Matter, Collins did not show a clear directional improvement, suggesting ongoing program execution volatility across its diverse contract base. This indicates that while overall EAC performance improved at the company level, Collins' program stability did not materially improve year-over-year.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar reported $35 million in post-TDR amortized cost for the Mining segment, indicating significant credit risk tied to this sector. By 2024, the company disclosed $8 million in revolving finance receivables specifically linked to Mining, a notable decline from earlier years. This reflects a strategic shift in how Caterpillar manages credit exposure in the Mining segment, moving from long-term amortized receivables to a more liquid revolving finance structure. The change suggests a reduced direct credit risk in Mining, aligning with a broader trend where total revolving finance receivables across all segments decreased from $115 million in 2023 to $125 million in 2024, with Mining's share shrinking from $3 million in 2023 to $8 million in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS reported that fuel surcharges contributed to double-digit revenue per piece growth in the U.S. Domestic Package segment, alongside base rate increases and favorable customer mix shifts. By 2023, despite macroeconomic headwinds including inflation and volume declines, the company continued to rely on strategic pricing, including surcharges, to maintain revenue quality. However, the effectiveness of this strategy appeared challenged as volume declines in the U.S. small package business were noted, suggesting that while fuel surcharges still played a role in revenue per piece, external pressures may have limited their overall impact on total segment revenue.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(2022) \u2192 Fuel Surcharges: UPS disclosed that fuel surcharges contributed to a 4.9% average rate increase in December 2020 and were expected to remain largely unchanged in 2022, supporting revenue per piece growth.",
        "Hop 2: Fuel Surcharges \u2192 U.S. Domestic Package Segment: In 2022, the U.S. Domestic Package segment experienced double-digit revenue per piece growth, with fuel surcharges being a key driver alongside base rate increases and favorable shifts in customer and product mix.",
        "Hop 3: U.S. Domestic Package Segment \u2190 UPS(2023): In 2023, despite continued use of fuel surcharges as part of pricing strategy, the U.S. Domestic Package segment faced volume declines due to inflationary pressures and labor negotiations, indicating a shift in the effectiveness of surcharge-driven revenue growth."

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nBusiness-to-consumer shipments represented approximately 60.7% of average daily volume compared to 63.6% in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\n\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\n\n## Rates and Product Mix\n\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\n\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\n\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\n\n## Fuel Surcharges\n\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy's ('DOE') Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE's On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic Air and Ground products were as follows:\n\n",

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing's Loss from Operations increased significantly\u2014by $2,943 million\u2014largely due to losses recognized on long-term contracts like the VC-25B, KC-46A Tanker, and other BDS programs. Despite this financial pressure, Boeing only slightly reduced its investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA), from $582 million in 2023 to $557 million in 2024, maintaining its 50% ownership stake. This minimal reduction suggests that Boeing continues to prioritize its strategic position in the space launch market through ULA, even amid operational losses. Rather than divesting or significantly cutting back, Boeing appears to be recalibrating within constraints, preserving its influence in a critical defense and space sector joint venture.",

      "question": "How did Boeing's increased investment in BCA in 2024 align with its strategy to address ongoing delivery challenges that originated in 2022, particularly in light of the $6,334 million increase in BCA's loss from operations?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment (BCA) faced significant losses due to lower deliveries, abnormal production costs, and the impact of the 737 MAX grounding and 787 program issues. These challenges persisted into 2024, with BCA's loss from operations increasing by $6,334 million compared to 2023, driven by continued production disruptions, reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, and the January 2024 grounding of the 737-9. Despite this worsening financial performance, Boeing increased its investment in BCA from $384 million in 2023 to $391 million in 2024. This modest increase suggests a strategic commitment to stabilize and improve the segment, likely aimed at addressing delivery constraints and production inefficiencies through targeted investments in operational improvements, R&D, and program cost management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BA(2022) \u2192 Lower Deliveries: Boeing's 2022 filings show that BCA experienced significant losses due to lower deliveries and production issues, including abnormal costs from the 737 MAX and 787 programs.",
        "Hop 2: Lower Deliveries \u2192 BCA: By 2024, these delivery and production challenges had not been resolved, contributing to a $6,334 million increase in BCA's loss from operations compared to 2023.",
        "Hop 3: BCA \u2190 BA(2024): Despite worsening losses, Boeing increased its investment in BCA from $384 million in 2023 to $391 million in 2024, indicating a strategic decision to support the segment through continued operational and production challenges."

The 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787 program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million and additional drivers as noted in the paragraph below.\n\nBCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,  $2,567  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  related  to  737  MAX,  $623  million  of  severance  cost,  $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  in  the  first  half  of  2020  from  the  temporary  suspension  of  operations  in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction  in  the  accounting  quantity  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  also  contributed  to  lower  earnings.  The  2019  loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nLower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.\n\n## Backlog\n\nOur  total  backlog  represents  the  estimated  transaction  prices  on  unsatisfied  and  partially  satisfied  performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform.

This allowed margins to increase year-on-year despite lower sales volume and inflationary pressures. By 2024, margins again increased year-on-year, primarily driven by productivity improvements and spending discipline, although this was partially offset by dis-synergies from the spinoff of Solventum.

      "answer": "The GE Energy Pension Plan reported a 6.6% annualized return in 2023, which contributed to a funding deficit of $748 million at the end of that year, with a benefit obligation of $10,239 million and fair value of assets at $9,491 million. In 2024, the benefit obligation for the broader category including GE Energy decreased to $28,166 million from $30,391 million in 2023, while the total fair value of assets remained relatively stable at $22,618 million compared to $24,174 million in 2023. However, the overall deficit across all plans increased from $6,217 million in 2023 to $5,548 million in 2024, indicating that despite positive returns in 2023, the funding gap remained substantial and only marginally improved year-over-year.",

      "answer": "In 2023, LMT's Missiles and Fire Control segment reported intersegment sales of $688 million, an increase from $627 million in 2022, indicating growing internal collaboration. However, in 2024, the company explicitly stated that segment operating profit excludes intersegment sales, costs, and profit as they are eliminated in consolidation and not part of management's evaluation of segment performance. This suggests that while internal transactions increased in 2023, LMT shifted toward emphasizing standalone segment performance in 2024, possibly to provide clearer insight into each segment's direct financial contributions amid rising internal interdependencies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax  laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application (including those with retroactive effect), such as the amortization for research and development expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans and the change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. In 2024, research and development capitalization resulted in a cash tax liability of approximately $370 million and our net deferred tax assets increased by a similar amount. While the largest impact of this provision was to the 2022 cash tax liability, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease over the period and be immaterial by 2027.\n\nWe are regularly  under  audit  or  ex amination  by  tax   authorities,  including  foreign  tax   authorities  (Australia,  Canada,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Poland,  the  United Kingdom, and other countries). The final resolution of tax audits and any related administrative reviews or litigation could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and changes to the timing of required tax payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These increases or changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15% applied on a country-by-country basis for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar 2), with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. While the United States has not enacted legislation to adopt Pillar 2 and it is uncertain if it will do so in the future, certain countries in which we operate have enacted such legislation, and other countries are in the process of doing so. We do not expect Pillar 2 to have a material impact on our effective tax  rate or our financial condition and results of operation.\n\n## Net Earnings\n\nWe reported net earnings of $5.3 billion ($22.31 per share) in 2024 and $6.9 billion ($27.55 per share) in 2023. Net earnings and earnings per share in 2024 were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 12.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2024 compared to 2023. The reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.\n\n## Business Segment Results of Operations\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.\n\nNet sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and thus are not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.\n\nBusiness segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. G overnment under the applicable U.S. G overnment Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) or portions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and other items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies' for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.",

      "answer": "The FedEx Services segment's capital expenditures dropped significantly from $431 million in 2023 to $282 million in 2024, contributing to the broader decline in FDX's consolidated total capital expenditures, which fell from $6,174 million in 2023 to $5,176 million in 2024. This reduction in the FedEx Services segment alone accounted for a $149 million decrease, representing a meaningful portion of the overall $998 million drop in consolidated capital spending. This indicates that the strategic reduction in the Services segment was a key driver of the company's overall capital expenditure contraction year-over-year.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\noverall  budget environment and whether development programs transition to production and the timing of such transition, all of which are dependent on  U.S. Government authorization and funding.\n\n## The F-35 program comprises a material portion of our revenue and reductions or delays in funding for this program and risks related to performance, schedule, cost and requirements of the program could adversely affect our performance.\n\nThe F-35 program, which consists of multiple development, production and sustainment contracts, is our largest program and represented 26% of our total consolidated net sales in 2024. A decision by the U.S. G overnment, international partners, or FMS customer countries to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned orders would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. G iven the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there  will  be  continual  reviews  related  to  aircraft  performance,  program  and  delivery  schedule,  cost,  and  requirements  as  part  of  the  DoD,  Congressional,  and international countries' oversight and budgeting processes. Challenges and risks associated with this program include supplier performance, software development, definitizing and receiving funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level  of  cost  associated  with  life  cycle  operations,  sustainment  and  potential  contractual  obligations,  inflation-related  cost  pressures,  the  ability  to  improve affordability, and potential competition from next-generation or other platforms. See also 'Status of the F-35 Program' in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the current program status and specific challenges and risks.\n\nWe also may not be successful in making hardware upgrades and other modernization capabilities in a timely manner, including as a result of dependencies on suppliers, which could increase costs and create schedule delays. Our ability to capture and retain future F-35 growth in development, production and sustainment is dependent  on  the  success  of  our  efforts  to  achieve  F-35  sustainment  performance,  customer  affordability,  supply  chain  improvements,  continued  reliability improvements and other efficiencies, some of which are outside our control. See also the Risk Factor below captioned 'We are heavily dependent on suppliers and if our subcontractors or other suppliers or teaming agreement or joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations, our performance and ability to win future business could be adversely affected' for further discussion.\n\n## We are subject to extensive procurement laws and regulations, including those that enable the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience. Our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we or those we do business with fail to comply with these laws and regulations.\n\nWe must comply with extensive laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. G overnment contracts. G overnment contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of these laws and regulations by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a joint venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to export products or perform services and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings. From time to time, the U.S. G overnment has proposed contract terms, imposed internal policies, or taken positions that represent fundamental changes from historical practices or that we believe are inconsistent with the FAR or other laws and regulations and that could adversely affect  our  business.  In  addition,  costs  to  comply  with  new  government  regulations  can  increase  our  costs,  reduce  our  margins  and  adversely  affect  our competitiveness. Also, a portion of our contracts are classified by the U.S. G overnment, which imposes security requirements that limit our ability to discuss our performance on these contracts, including any specific risks, disputes and claims.\n\nContract Termination. The U.S. G overnment may terminate any of our government contracts at its convenience or for default based on our performance, either of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. G enerally, prime contractors have similar termination rights under subcontracts related to government contracts.  If  a  contract  is  terminated  for  convenience,  we  generally  are  protected  by  provisions  covering  reimbursement  for  costs  incurred  on  the contract and profit on those costs. However, to the extent insufficient funds have been appropriated by the U.S. G overnment to cover our costs upon a termination for convenience, the U.S. G overnment may assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding. If a contract is terminated for default, the U.S. G overnment could make claims to reduce our recovery or recoup its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties, exposing us to liability and adversely affecting our ability  to  compete  for  future  contracts  and  orders.  In  addition,  the  U.S.  G overnment  could  terminate  a  prime  contract  under  which  we  are  a  subcontractor, notwithstanding  the  fact  that  our  performance  and  the  quality  of  the  products  or  services  we  delivered  were  consistent  with  our  contractual  obligations  as  a subcontractor.\n\nUndefinitized Contract Action (UCA). When operating under a undefinitized contract action (UCA), which is when we begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties, the U.S. G overnment has the right to unilaterally definitize contracts, which it has ex ercised in the past and which, absent a successful appeal, obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. G overnment. This can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms. If a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a program or impose burdensome terms.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar's Mining segment reported $11 million in post-TDR amortized cost, indicating continued exposure to the sector (Chunk 1). This aligns with Resource Industries' strong performance in 2021, where mining demand contributed to a 27% increase in quarterly sales to $2.762 billion (Chunk 2). By 2023, Caterpillar increased capital expenditures in Resource Industries from $237 million in 2022 to $245 million in 2023 (Chunk 3), suggesting strategic investment in mining equipment and technologies to capitalize on the sector's growth potential. This represents a shift from maintaining mining exposure in 2022 to actively expanding Resource Industries capabilities in 2023.",

Increased manufacturing costs and SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and material costs.\n\nThe increase in SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses was driven by investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor, and higher shortterm incentive compensation expense.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 11.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's Financial Products Segment reported a slight decrease in investment and interest income from $494 million in 2023 to $482 million in 2024. This segment is directly responsible for financing activities, including depreciation on leased equipment, underwriting expenses, and investment and interest income. In 2023, the segment had capital expenditures of $1,299 million, which likely supported the financing portfolio contributing to the income in that year. While 2024 capital expenditures for the segment are not explicitly stated, the slight decline in income may suggest a reduced asset base or lower yield on investments and leases. Without explicit 2024 capital expenditure figures for the Financial Products Segment, the change in income could also reflect shifts in interest rates, credit performance, or portfolio size within the segment's financing activities.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CAT's Resource Industries segment reported $403 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, indicating a significant capital investment base likely tied to its mining operations, which were described as a key driver of sales growth in 2021. By 2024, CAT's Mining segment reported $8 million in North America revenue and $14 million globally, showing continued but relatively modest revenue generation from mining activities. The lack of updated depreciation figures for 2024, combined with stable mining revenue levels, suggests that CAT may have slowed new capital investments in mining-focused equipment or shifted toward utilizing existing assets more efficiently, rather than expanding its mining-related capital base.",

The increase was due to higher sales volume driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. End-user demand was higher in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates. Dealers decreased inventories more during 2020 than during 2021.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $1.291 billion in 2021, an increase of $395 million, or 44 percent, compared with $896 million in 2020.  The  increase  was  mainly  due  to  higher  sales  volume  and  favorable  price  realization,  partially  offset  by  unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, as well as higher material and period manufacturing costs, partially offset by the favorable impact of cost absorption. Higher period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased during 2021, compared with a decrease during 2020.\n\nHigher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were driven primarily by higher short-term incentive compensation expense and investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor costs.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 13.0 percent for 2021, compared with 11.3 percent for 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2023, EMR reported only $10 million in total restructuring and related costs across all segments, with no specific costs attributed to the Test & Measurement segment. By 2024, the company's total restructuring costs surged to $104 million, with $81 million directly attributed to the newly formed Test & Measurement segment. This segment, which did not exist in 2023, reported a significant earnings loss of $290 million in 2024. The substantial restructuring costs likely contributed to the segment's negative earnings, suggesting that the integration or setup of Test & Measurement was costly and had not yet yielded profitability in its first reported year. The restructuring costs represented 77.9% of the segment\u2019s total costs ($81M out of $104M total restructuring), indicating a focused and expensive strategic move into this business area despite short-term financial drag.",

      "answer": "The increase in intersegment sales for Rotary and Mission Systems from $1,930 million in 2022 to $2,320 million in 2024 suggests a growing internal dependency across business segments. However, as noted in both the 2022 and 2024 disclosures, intersegment sales are excluded from the calculation of segment operating profit because these transactions are eliminated in consolidation. This means that despite the significant rise in intersegment sales, the performance of Rotary and Mission Systems is assessed based on external sales and other metrics that are not influenced by internal transfers. Therefore, while internal collaboration appears to have intensified, the financial evaluation of the segment remains focused on externally generated revenue and profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax  laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application (including those with retroactive effect), such as the amortization for research and development expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans and the change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. In 2024, research and development capitalization resulted in a cash tax liability of approximately $370 million and our net deferred tax assets increased by a similar amount. While the largest impact of this provision was to the 2022 cash tax liability, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease over the period and be immaterial by 2027.\n\nWe are regularly  under  audit  or  ex amination  by  tax   authorities,  including  foreign  tax   authorities  (Australia,  Canada,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Poland,  the  United Kingdom, and other countries). The final resolution of tax audits and any related administrative reviews or litigation could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and changes to the timing of required tax payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These increases or changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15% applied on a country-by-country basis for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar 2), with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. While the United States has not enacted legislation to adopt Pillar 2 and it is uncertain if it will do so in the future, certain countries in which we operate have enacted such legislation, and other countries are in the process of doing so. We do not expect Pillar 2 to have a material impact on our effective tax  rate or our financial condition and results of operation.\n\n## Net Earnings\n\nWe reported net earnings of $5.3 billion ($22.31 per share) in 2024 and $6.9 billion ($27.55 per share) in 2023. Net earnings and earnings per share in 2024 were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 12.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2024 compared to 2023. The reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.\n\n## Business Segment Results of Operations\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.\n\nNet sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and thus are not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.\n\nBusiness segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. G overnment under the applicable U.S. G overnment Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) or portions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and other items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance.

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM's Health Care segment contributed an 8.4% increase to total sales, driven by organic growth in areas like oral care and biopharma filtration. However, by 2024, MMM reported a total sales change of -1.9%, indicating a reversal from growth to decline. This shift reflects a broader downturn in performance, where the earlier momentum from Health Care was offset by negative organic sales trends and lack of offsetting growth drivers in 2024.",

In 2023, CAT's total external sales and revenues increased to $67,060 million from $59,427 million in 2022, representing a growth of $7,633 million or 12.8%.

      "answer": "In 2023, Pratt & Whitney experienced a $133 million unfavorable impact due to the Powder Metal Matter, which increased costs on aftermarket contracts, contributing to a total $611 million change in net EAC adjustments year-over-year. This reflected ongoing challenges in cost estimation and contract execution. In 2024, the absence of this specific unfavorable impact helped drive a $0.2 billion improvement in net EAC adjustments compared to 2023, indicating better cost control and stabilized contract performance. The resolution of the Powder Metal Matter appears to have been a key driver in Pratt & Whitney\u2019s improved financial predictability and contract management in 2024.",

The change at Pratt was primarily driven by the absence of a $0.1 billion unfavorable impact recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the Powder Metal Matter. The change at  Collins  was  spread  across  numerous  individual  programs,  with  no  individual  or  common  significant  driver.  The  change  at  Raytheon  was  primarily  due  to improvement in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts.\n\nIn addition to the amounts included in the table above, during the fourth quarter of 2024, as a result of obtaining critical licenses and further regulatory approvals, we restarted work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer and began recognizing revenue on these contracts. As a result, Raytheon recognized a net operating profit benefit of $0.1 billion primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2024, Raytheon initiated the termination of a fix ed price development contract with a foreign customer (Raytheon Contract Termination) and recognized a $0.6 billion charge related to the impact of the termination. The charge included the write-off of remaining contract assets and the estimated settlement with the customer. The contract termination was completed and customer settlement occurred during the fourth quarter of 2024, in line with previously accrued amounts.\n\nThe change in net EAC adjustments of $0.6 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments at Pratt &amp; Whitney and to a lesser extent at Collins and Raytheon. Included in the change at Pratt &amp; Whitney was the unfavorable impact of $0.1 billion recorded in the third quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost to our aftermarket contracts resulting from the  Powder  Metal  Matter and an unfavorable impact of approximately $60 million recorded in the fourth quarter of 2023 as a result of increased cost on a military program. The change in net EAC adjustments at Pratt &amp; Whitney also includes the absence of a $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket program in the second quarter of 2022. The change at Collins was spread across numerous individual programs, with no individual or common significant driver. The change at Raytheon was primarily due to unfavorable  changes  in  net  EAC  adjustments  related  to  certain  fix ed  price  development  contracts  and  $51  million  of  unfavorable  EAC  adjustments  related  to significant contract options exercised in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar eliminated noncontrolling interest profit (loss) recorded by Financial Products for subsidiaries partially owned by ME&T subsidiaries as part of its intercompany accounting practices. This elimination was consistent in 2024, showing continuity in how Caterpillar accounts for noncontrolling interest profits within the Financial Products segment. Additionally, as of December 31, 2024, Caterpillar continued to operate under ISDA master netting agreements that permit net settlement of derivative contracts, limiting credit loss exposure to only those gains recorded but not yet received. While the core accounting treatment remained stable, the continued use of ISDA agreements indicates an ongoing strategic framework for managing counterparty risk without requiring collateral exchanges, suggesting Caterpillar maintained consistent risk management practices alongside steady intercompany profit elimination protocols.",

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed that a 5% improvement in claim frequency rates would reduce self-insurance reserves by $290 million, highlighting the sensitivity of reserves to claims trends. By 2023, the company reported an actual year-over-year increase in self-insurance reserves from $1,069 million (2022) to $1,320 million (2023), a rise of $251 million. This increase, while significant, was less than the $290 million sensitivity amount, suggesting that the actual change in claim frequency rates was less than a 5% deterioration, or that mitigating factors offset some of the expected reserve growth.

      "question": "How did Boeing's BCA segment performance in 2024 reflect the impact of increased research and development expenses that were already rising in 2022, and what does this trend suggest about the long-term financial implications of their strategic R&D investments?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing's BCA segment experienced a loss from operations of $2,341 million, which was partially attributed to rising research and development (R&D) expenses. By 2024, this loss had significantly increased to $7,969 million, driven in part by even higher R&D spending, which compounded other issues such as reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, production disruptions, and 737-9 customer considerations. The escalation in R&D costs from 2022 to 2024 indicates that while the company was investing more in innovation and future product development, these investments did not yield immediate financial returns and instead contributed to worsening operational losses. This trend suggests that Boeing's strategic emphasis on R&D, while potentially beneficial in the long term, placed significant short-term financial pressure on the BCA segment, especially when combined with other operational challenges.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BA(2022) \u2192 BCA: In 2022, BCA reported a loss from operations of $2,341 million, with rising R&D expenses as a contributing factor.",
        "Hop 2: BCA \u2192 Higher Research and Development Expense: BCA's financial performance was increasingly impacted by elevated R&D spending, indicating a strategic focus on innovation and future product development.",
        "Hop 3: Higher Research and Development Expense \u2190 BA(2024): By 2024, the impact of higher R&D expenses had intensified, contributing to a much larger operational loss of $7,969 million for BCA, despite some offsetting factors like reduced abnormal production costs."

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC.\n\n118",

      "question": "How did the $426 million reduction in Net UTB's impact on the effective tax rate between 2022 and 2024 influence MMM's Accrued Income Taxes liability, given the $319 million increase in Accrued Income Taxes from 2022 to 2024?",
      "answer": "Between 2022 and 2024, MMM's Net UTB impact on the effective tax rate decreased from $1,112 million in 2022 to $686 million in 2024, a reduction of $426 million. This decline indicates a resolution or reassessment of certain unrecognized tax benefits, which typically would reduce tax liabilities. However, despite this reduction in Net UTB, MMM's Accrued Income Taxes liability increased by $319 million over the same period, as seen in the change from a $47 million outflow in 2022 to a $272 million outflow in 2024. This counterintuitive increase suggests that other tax accrual factors\u2014potentially related to changes in tax positions, timing differences, or new liabilities\u2014offset the impact of the Net UTB reduction. The relationship underscores the complexity of MMM's tax accounting, where changes in UTB do not always directly correlate with changes in current tax liabilities, especially in the context of ongoing adjustments to deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes.",

        "Hop 1: MMM(2022) \u2192 Net UTB: Net UTB would affect the effective tax rate by $1,112 million as of December 31, 2021, indicating a significant contingent tax liability.",
        "Hop 2: Net UTB \u2192 Accrued Income Taxes: Net UTB is included in Accrued Income Taxes and other balance sheet components, meaning changes in Net UTB can influence the Accrued Income Taxes liability.",

The ending net UTB results from adjusting the gross balance for deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. The net UTB is included as components of Other Assets, Accrued Income Taxes, and Other Liabilities within the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. The Company recognized in the consolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $14 million of expense, $21 million of expense, and $33 million of expense in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The amount of interest and penalties recognized may be an expense or benefit due to new or remeasured unrecognized tax benefit accruals. At December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $140 million and $126 million, respectively. Included in these interest and penalty amounts are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility.\n\nAs a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3M, income from certain foreign operations in the following countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through the following: China (2022), Switzerland (2026), Brazil (2029) and Singapore (2032). The income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $204 million (36 cents per diluted share) in 2021, $163 million (28 cents per diluted share) in 2020, and $127 million (22 cents per diluted share) in 2019.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has approximately $17.7 billion of undistributed earnings in its foreign subsidiaries. Approximately $5.5 billion of these earnings are no longer considered permanently reinvested. The incremental tax cost to repatriate these earnings to the US is immaterial. The Company has not provided deferred taxes on approximately $12.2 billion of undistributed earnings from non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 which are indefinitely reinvested in operations. Because of the multiple avenues by which to repatriate the earnings to minimize tax cost, and because a large portion of these earnings are not liquid, it is not practical to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not reinvested indefinitely.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing's BCA segment was negatively impacted by abnormal production costs of $1,887 million, which contributed to operational losses tied to the lingering effects of the 737 MAX grounding and production disruptions. These costs were part of broader challenges that suppressed segment performance. However, in 2023, BCA saw a significant turnaround with a revenue increase of $7,875 million, primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries.

Deliveries  of  the  737  MAX  were suspended following these orders. Deliveries in the U.S. resumed in late 2020 following rescission by the FAA of its grounding  order.  In  addition,  several  other  non-U.S.  civil  aviation  authorities,  including  the  Brazilian  National  Civil Aviation Agency,  Transport  Canada,  and  the  European  Union Aviation  Safety Agency  have  subsequently  approved return of operations, allowing us to resume deliveries in those jurisdictions. The Civil Aviation Administration of China issued an airworthiness directive in the fourth quarter of 2021 outlining actions required for airlines to return to service. We expect 737 MAX deliveries to China to resume in 2022, subject to final regulatory approvals, although risk remains around  the  timing  and  rate  of  those  deliveries.  Over  185  countries  have  approved  the  resumption  of  737  MAX operations. The 737 MAX remains grounded in a small number of non-U.S. jurisdictions.\n\nWe have gradually increased production rates in 2020 and 2021 and continue to expect to increase the production rate to 31 per month by early 2022, as well as implement further gradual production rate increases in subsequent periods based on market demand and supply chain capacity.\n\nWe produced at abnormally low production rates in 2020 and 2021 and expensed abnormal production costs of $1,887 and $2,567 during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. We do not expect the remaining abnormal costs related to the 737 MAX to be significant and expect most of the remainder to be incurred in early 2022.\n\nIn 2021, we delivered 245 aircraft. We have approximately 335 airplanes in inventory as of December 31, 2021 and we anticipate  delivering  most  of  these  aircraft  by  the  end  of  2023.  We  continue  to  work  with  customers  who  have requested  to  defer  deliveries  or  to  cancel  orders  for  737  MAX  aircraft,  and  we  are  remarketing  and/or  delaying deliveries of certain aircraft included within inventory. In the event that we are unable to resume aircraft deliveries in China  and/or  ramp  up  deliveries  consistent  with  our  assumptions,  our  expectation  of  delivery  timing  and  our expectation regarding future gradual production rate increases could be impacted.",

See pages 49 - 51.\n\nLoss from operations decreased by $9,865 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower losses at BCA and higher earnings at BGS.

BGS earnings from operations increased by $1,567 million in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to charges incurred in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as higher commercial services volume.\n\nLoss from operations increased by $10,792 million in 2020 compared with 2019 primarily due to increased losses at BCA and decreased earnings at BGS and BDS.

BCA's loss in 2020 also reflects the absence of MAX deliveries during the first three quarters of the year, lower widebody  deliveries  and  lower  program  margins  resulting  from  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  787  production  issues, abnormal  production  costs,  737NG  frame  fitting  component  repair  costs,  severance  costs  and  737  MAX  customer considerations.\n\nThe loss in 2019 primarily reflects  the  absence  of  737  MAX  deliveries  in  the  second,  third  and  fourth  quarters  and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.

      "answer": "In 2023, BA's Loss from Operations increased by $2,943 million primarily due to losses recognized on long-term contracts at BDS, including the VC-25B, KC-46A Tanker, Commercial Crew, T-7A Red Hawk, and MQ-25 programs. This significant loss indicates financial strain on the BDS segment from fixed-price development contracts. However, in 2024, BA continued to invest in BDS, as evidenced by their $557 million equity method investment in United Launch Alliance under the BDS segment, suggesting a strategic commitment to maintaining and potentially growing BDS's capabilities despite prior financial challenges.",

      "answer": "In 2023, CAT's ISDA master netting agreements within ME&T and Financial Products allowed for net settlement of derivative contracts, with no cash collateral received or pledged, indicating a streamlined but exposure-heavy structure. The inter-segment eliminations between ME&T and Financial Products included several specific categories such as elimination of interest expense, net expenses, discounts on receivables, and equity profit, which showed a complex but integrated financial relationship. By 2024, the structure remained consistent in terms of netting and collateral policy, but the exposure to credit loss was explicitly limited to recorded but unpaid gains, suggesting a more defined risk boundary was introduced while maintaining the same operational netting framework. This indicates a strategic refinement in managing counterparty credit risk without altering the foundational inter-segment financial agreements.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing's BDS segment experienced significant unfavorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments that contributed to its loss from operations. By 2023, these adjustments improved by $2,328 million compared to 2022, leading to a $1,780 million reduction in BDS segment losses. This improvement helped drive a broader $2,746 million decrease in Boeing's total loss from operations in 2023. However, in 2024, the trend reversed sharply as BDS losses increased by $3,649 million compared to 2023, primarily due to higher unfavorable contract adjustments on fixed-price development programs.

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC.\n\n118",

      "answer": "In 2023, MMM's Safety and Industrial segment experienced a negative 0.5% impact from foreign exchange translation on sales, contributing to a total sales decline of 5.6%. By 2024, the Health Care segment was fully separated into Solventum, and the Safety and Industrial segment became one of only three remaining business segments. This strategic repositioning, combined with the removal of the Health Care segment's potentially stabilizing geographic footprint, likely increased MMM's overall exposure to currency risk in the Safety and Industrial segment. The 2024 changes in segment reporting structure and the elimination of internal currency diversification effects previously provided by the Health Care segment indicate a more concentrated and potentially more volatile exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations.",

Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Raytheon contributed $26.6 billion in business segment sales, indicating strong performance. However, in 2024, RTX's R&D spending saw a $0.1 billion increase overall compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher spending at Collins and Pratt & Whitney, while Raytheon experienced lower expenses on development programs. This reflects a strategic shift in R&D investment toward other business segments despite Raytheon's strong sales contribution in the prior year.",

      "answer": "The decline in Caterpillar's long-term receivables from $28 million in 2022 to $21 million in 2024 suggests a reduced financial exposure to the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment over this period. However, the forward-looking allocation of $46 million for 2025 indicates a strategic recalibration rather than a complete withdrawal, pointing to renewed investment focus in the segment despite the interim pullback in receivables. This pattern implies Caterpillar may have been managing risk or reallocating capital in preparation for future growth in this business line.",

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX reported a $295 million increase in intersegment eliminations, primarily driven by Collins Aerospace, indicating a rise in internal transactions within the company. By 2024, RTX\u2019s capital expenditures for Collins Aerospace rose from $628 million in 2023 to $786 million in 2024, reflecting a deliberate strategic investment to support and scale the growing operations within the segment. This increase suggests that RTX aimed to enhance Collins Aerospace\u2019s production capacity or technological capabilities in response to the higher internal demand observed in 2023.",

      "question": "How did the $6.2 billion organic increase in RTX's Total Cost of Sales in 2024 reflect the performance and contribution of the Collins Segment compared to 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, RTX's Collins Segment was a key component of its segment structure, contributing to various defense and aerospace product lines such as fire control radars, EO/IR systems, and satellite components. By 2024, the Collins Segment was explicitly cited as one of the primary drivers behind the $6.2 billion organic increase in RTX's Total Cost of Sales compared to 2023. This increase was directly tied to higher net sales at Collins, indicating that the segment experienced growth in production and delivery of its technologically advanced systems. The relationship between Collins Segment performance and Total Cost of Sales demonstrates a clear cost-follows-sales dynamic, where increased segment activity directly translated into higher overall cost of sales for RTX in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE reported a total pension plan deficit of $15,341 million, while by 2024, this deficit had decreased to $5,548 million. This indicates a significant improvement in the company's pension funding position over the two-year period. The improvement was driven by a combination of factors, including changes in benefit obligations and increases in the fair value of plan assets. Specifically, the benefit obligation for total plans decreased from $98,863 million in 2022 to $28,166 million in 2024, while the fair value of assets increased from $83,522 million in 2022 to $22,618 million in 2024.

      "answer": "Despite Pratt & Whitney's revenue contribution rising from $16.8B in 2022 to $18.3B in 2023, the 2023 annual report highlights significant production challenges with the Geared Turbofan engines, including accelerated inspection requirements for the PW1100G-JM engine fleet. This suggests that while the segment's financial performance improved year-over-year, it simultaneously faced operational difficulties that could have impacted long-term profitability and customer satisfaction. The increased revenue may reflect strong demand or contract fulfillment, but the disclosed production issues indicate that operational execution did not fully align with the segment\u2019s growth trajectory, potentially signaling risks to future performance.",

        "Hop 1: RTX(2022) \u2192 Consolidated net sales: Pratt & Whitney contributed $16.8B to RTX's consolidated net sales in 2022.",

        "Hop 3: Pratt & Whitney \u2190 RTX(2023): In 2023, Pratt & Whitney\u2019s contribution increased to $18.3B, but the segment faced production challenges related to its Geared Turbofan engines, as disclosed in the 2023 annual report."

      "answer": "In 2023, MMM reported a 10.9% decline in overall operating income, reflecting broad challenges across the company (from hop1_evidence). However, by 2024, the Consumer segment showed a modest 3.1% increase in operating income (from hop2_evidence), indicating a shift in performance dynamics. This contrast becomes particularly meaningful in light of the April 2024 separation of the Health Care business into Solventum, which likely allowed MMM to reallocate resources and focus more strategically on its remaining segments, including Consumer (from hop3_evidence). The Consumer segment\u2019s relative resilience and positive growth suggest it played a stabilizing role during a period of restructuring and may have been positioned more favorably in terms of market demand or cost structure compared to other segments.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "question": "How did the $290 million sensitivity estimate in 2022 related to claim severity rates influence the $251 million increase in UPS's self-insurance reserves from 2022 to 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS disclosed that a 5% improvement or reduction in claim severity rates would result in a $290 million change in self-insurance reserves and expenses. By 2023, the self-insurance reserves increased by $251 million (from $1,069 million in 2022 to $1,320 million in 2023). This suggests that UPS likely experienced higher claim severity rates in 2023 than previously assumed in 2022, leading to a significant upward adjustment in reserves. The $290 million sensitivity figure from 2022 aligns with the magnitude of the actual change, indicating that the increase in reserves was driven by worsening claim severity trends beyond initial projections.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: UPS(2022) \u2192 Claim Severity Rates: UPS estimated that a 5% change in claim severity rates would result in a $290 million change in self-insurance reserves and expenses.",

      "question": "How did the relationship between Caterpillar's Financial Products segment and the Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) segment evolve from 2023 to 2024, particularly in terms of their consolidated liabilities and inter-segment eliminations?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Caterpillar's Financial Products segment reported total liabilities of $23.6 billion, compared to ME&T's liabilities of $9.6 billion, indicating a significant financial footprint of the Financial Products division relative to ME&T. By 2024, the structure of segment reporting remained consistent, with ME&T continuing to be defined as Caterpillar's operations excluding Financial Products, and inter-segment eliminations still playing a key role in the consolidated financial presentation. However, the increase in Financial Products' liabilities from $23.6B (2023) to an implied higher amount in 2024 (based on continued growth in receivables), combined with ME&T's stable liability base, suggests a growing disparity in the financial scale between the two segments. This evolution highlights the increasing reliance on Financial Products to support ME&T's core equipment financing activities.",

      "question": "How did the increase in UPS's expected contributions to international pension benefits from $96M in 2022 to an expected $49M in benefit payments in 2023 relate to the change in the cash balance interest credit rate applied to those benefits, which rose from 2.94% in 2022 to 3.69% in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS expected to contribute $96M to international pension benefits and projected $44M in benefit payments for that year, increasing to $49M in 2023. The cash balance interest credit rate applied to these international pension benefits was 2.94% in 2022, based on the prior year's (2021) disclosed rate. By 2023, this rate had increased to 3.69%, indicating a significant upward adjustment in assumptions. This suggests that UPS may have modified its pension funding strategy in response to broader financial or regulatory changes, as the higher interest credit rate could improve the projected growth of pension assets, potentially offsetting the rising expected benefit payments.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar's Dealer Portfolio Segment had $78 million in finance receivables that were 91+ days past due in Latin America, all originated in 2017. By 2024, the company reported $47 million in gross write-offs within the same segment and region, all originating prior to 2019. This indicates that while the amount of severely delinquent accounts decreased from $78 million to $47 million, the transition from past-due status to actual write-offs suggests a tightening of credit risk exposure in Latin America, with older receivables eventually being written off after several years of collection efforts.",

This recovery is linked to inter-segment sales, which rose to $1.959 billion in 2023 from $1.722 billion in 2022, suggesting improved internal collaboration and resource sharing as the segment rebounded.

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses. Refer to 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' for further  details.  While  we  have  seen  indications  that  commercial  air  travel  is  recovering,  we  continue  to  closely  monitor  our commercial aerospace assets for recoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures.

      "answer": "MMM's Industrial Adhesives and Tapes sales declined from $2,220 million in 2022 to $2,104 million in 2024, reflecting a consistent downward trend over the two-year period. This decline aligns with MMM's broader Safety and Industrial segment performance, which saw total sales fall from $11,604 million in 2022 to $10,961 million in 2024. Despite this, 2024 marked a stabilization in sales for the segment on an organic basis, with Industrial Adhesives and Tapes benefiting from growth in bonding solutions for electronics and auto body repair, offsetting earlier declines linked to consumer electronics softness and reduced e-commerce activity in 2023.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "answer": "GE's separation of GE HealthCare in 2023 had a significant positive impact on its Earnings (Loss) of Discontinued Operations Before Income Taxes in 2024. In 2023, GE disclosed remaining exposure to GE HealthCare through $44 million in performance and bank guarantees and $81 million in indemnification obligations under the Tax Matters Agreement and Transition Services Agreement. Despite these liabilities, the financial impact of the separation improved markedly in 2024. In 2023, the Earnings (Loss) of Discontinued Operations Before Income Taxes showed a loss of $246 million, but in 2024, this metric turned strongly positive with a gain of $2,350 million.

      "question": "Based on Caterpillar's 2022 and 2023 financial disclosures, how did the changes in intersegment sales and restructuring activities influence the shift in Corporate Items and Eliminations expenses, particularly in relation to the Energy & Transportation segment's $4.249 billion sales increase in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar's consolidated financial statements showed intersegment sales and revenues at $4,190 million, with Corporate Items and Eliminations totaling $4,969 million. By 2023, Corporate Items and Eliminations expenses decreased to $2.090 billion, a significant reduction of $319 million year-over-year. This decrease was primarily due to the absence of a 2022 goodwill impairment charge related to the Rail division and lower expenses from timing differences, despite higher restructuring costs, including the impact of the Longwall business divestiture. The Energy & Transportation segment, which saw a $4.249 billion sales increase in 2023, contributed to this shift through increased intersegment sales and favorable price realization. The reduction in Corporate Items and Eliminations suggests Caterpillar improved its internal transaction efficiency and adjusted its strategic focus, particularly with restructuring efforts in key segments like Energy & Transportation.",

        "Hop 1: [CAT](2022) \u2192 Sales and Revenues: Caterpillar reported intersegment sales and revenues of $4,190 million in 2022, with Energy & Transportation contributing $20,287 million in total sales.",
        "Hop 2: [Sales and Revenues] \u2192 [Corporate Items and Eliminations]: Intersegment sales are directly tied to the Corporate Items and Eliminations line item, which totaled $4,969 million in 2022.",
        "Hop 3: [Corporate Items and Eliminations] \u2190 [CAT](2023): In 2023, Corporate Items and Eliminations expense decreased to $2.090 billion, influenced by restructuring activities and the absence of the prior-year goodwill impairment, while Energy & Transportation sales rose by $4.249 billion."

          "chunk_text": "## FOURTH QUARTER 2021 COMPARED WITH FOURTH QUARTER 2020\n\n## CONSOLIDATED SALES AND REVENUES\n\nThe chart above graphically illustrates reasons for the change in consolidated sales and revenues between the fourth quarter of 2020 (at left) and the fourth quarter of 2021 (at right). Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13.798 billion, an increase of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, compared with $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the ISE & TOD segment reported a gain on sale of business of $2,783 million, contributing to a total gain on sale of business of $13,393 million for Emerson. By 2024, the gain on sale of business had dropped significantly to $539 million, indicating that the divestiture of the ISE & TOD segment was largely completed by 2024, as the segment no longer contributed to operating results. This sharp decline in gains reflects the conclusion of the divestiture process and marks a strategic shift in Emerson\u2019s portfolio focus.",

      "answer": "In 2022, a 5% improvement or deterioration in claim severity or frequency rates would have impacted UPS's self-insurance reserves by approximately $290 million. By 2024, this sensitivity increased slightly to $300 million for a 5% change in the same assumptions. This indicates that UPS's exposure to claim severity and frequency became more volatile over time, requiring larger reserve adjustments for the same percentage change in underlying claim assumptions. This evolution suggests that UPS's liability risk profile grew, necessitating increased financial cushioning as reflected in the higher sensitivity of self-insurance reserves.",

The assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates, and we believe that they are reasonable, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends.\n\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are:\n\n- Changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date;\n- Differences between expected and the actual return on plan assets;\n- Changes in demographic assumptions including mortality;\n- Differences in participant experience from demographic assumptions; and\n- Changes in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by UPS.\n\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligations) in pension expense upon remeasurement of a plan.

In Resource Industries, dealer inventory increased more in 2022 than in 2023, which was a drag on sales volume despite higher end-user demand.

Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE warned that the separation of its businesses, including GE HealthCare, would result in significant ongoing costs from operating as independent entities that could no longer be shared (e.g., tax liabilities, indemnifications, and operational restructuring). By 2023, after the separation of GE HealthCare, these anticipated costs materialized into specific financial obligations: GE disclosed $81 million in indemnification obligations under the Transition Services Agreement and Tax Matters Agreement, and $44 million in remaining performance and bank guarantees tied to its former HealthCare business. This demonstrates a direct evolution from the general risk of increased costs described in 2022 to the concrete financial liabilities disclosed in 2023, confirming the financial impact of the separation on GE\u2019s post-spinoff obligations.",

          "chunk_text": "on a different timeline than expected. If we are unable to complete any of the separations, we will have incurred costs without realizing the benefits of such transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies. And, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the Company's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect to incur non-U.S. cash taxes on the preparatory restructuring and may also incur non-cash tax expense including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will qualify as taxfree for U.S. purposes. If the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to the Company's shareholders would become taxable and the new independent companies might incur income tax liabilities as well. Furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful.\n\nWhether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of the Company; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among the three companies, particularly given the staggered nature of the separation transactions; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing or attracting new business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; assigning customer contracts and intellectual property to each of the businesses; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets. In particular, GE for the past several years has been undertaking various restructuring and business transformation actions (including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives) that have entailed changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. This poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial targets, loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation, and these risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the planned separation transactions. Moreover, completion of the separation transactions will result in the three independent public companies that are smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than GE is today. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company's results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Each of the separate companies will also incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. If the separation transactions are completed, investors holding our common stock may sell the common stock of any of the new independent companies that do not match their investment strategies, which may cause a decline in the market price of such common stock.\n\nCOVID-19 - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. Our operations and financial performance since early 2020 have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and may continue to cause, a slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect economic activity globally or in various regions, the extent to which this will adversely impact our future operations and financial performance is uncertain. Across all of our businesses, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, site shutdowns, workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at those of our customers and suppliers, global supply chain disruptions and price inflation. We also have experienced, and may continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for products and services, customer requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications, supply chain under-liquidation, delays of deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones, delays or cancellations of new projects and related down payments and other factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on our customers that adversely impact our businesses. In particular, interruptions of regional and international air travel from COVID-19 are having a material adverse effect on our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our services and products. While our Aviation business is showing continued signs of recovery, the recently renewed intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic in many parts of the world could stall the recovery achieved to date and lead to future requests for payment deferrals, contract modifications, and similar actions across the aviation sector, which may lead to additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts, or to customer disputes.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the impact of coronavirus variants and resurgences; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines; our employees' compliance with vaccine mandates that may apply in various jurisdictions; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace and extent of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A number of accounting estimates that we make have been and will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties related to these and other factors, and our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 (see Note 1). As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described below.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE reported a total pension deficit of $15,341 million, which included a $7,226 million surplus/deficit for the GE Supplementary Pension Plan. By 2023, the overall pension deficit decreased to $8,133 million. Within this, the GE Energy Supplementary Pension Plan specifically showed a deficit of $541 million. This indicates that while the overall pension deficit was reduced year-over-year, the GE Energy Supplementary Pension Plan transitioned from being part of a larger deficit structure in 2022 to having a smaller, more defined deficit in 2023, suggesting a strategic shift in pension liability management.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Boeing's BGS segment earnings from operations increased by $1,567 million compared with 2020, primarily due to charges incurred in 2020 driven by the impacts of the pandemic, as well as higher commercial services volume. This recovery in commercial services volume and the resulting improvement in BGS earnings signaled a positive trend in the segment's performance. By 2024, Boeing's investment approach reflected this improvement, as evidenced by the segment's equity method investments balance remaining stable at $391 million in 2024 compared to $384 million in 2023. The increased earnings from BGS appear to have supported Boeing's continued investment in the segment, maintaining a consistent investment level despite broader declines in other equity method investments.",

The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was $101 million lower than the comparable period in the prior year .\n\n## Earnings From Operations\n\nBGS earnings  from  operations  in  2021  increased  by  $1,567  million  compared  with  2020,  primarily  due  to  charges incurred in 2020 driven by impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as higher commercial services volume in 2021, partially offset by an inventory write-down of $220 million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 driven by revised cost estimates on certain customer contracts. Charges in 2020 included $531 million of inventory write-downs, $178 million of related impairments of distribution rights primarily driven by airlines' decisions to retire certain aircraft, $398 million for higher expected credit losses primarily driven by customer liquidity issues, $115 million of contract termination and facility impairment charges, and $72 million of severance costs. The net favorable impact of cumulative contract catchup adjustments in 2021 was $98 million lower than the prior year .\n\nBGS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $2,247  million  compared  with  2019,  primarily  due  to  lower commercial services revenue as well as the 2020 earnings charges described in the previous paragraph. The favorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments in 2020 was consistent with the prior year .\n\n## Backlog\n\nBGS total backlog of $20,496 million at December 31, 2021 decreased by 1% from $20,632 million at December 31, 2020, primarily due to revenue recognized on contracts awarded in prior years.\n\n## Boeing Capital\n\n## Business Environment and Trends\n\nBCC's gross customer financing and investment portfolio at December 31, 2021 totaled $1,734 million. A substantial portion of BCC's portfolio is composed of customers that have less than investment-grade credit. BCC's portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across Boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8 aircraft.\n\nBCC provided customer financing of $14 million during 2020 and none during 2021. While we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2021 and/or provide refinancing for existing bridge debt, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.\n\nAircraft  values  and  lease  rates  are  impacted  by  the  number  and  type  of  aircraft  that  are  currently  out  of  service. Approximately 5,300 western-built commercial jet aircraft (20.5% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2021, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. Of these parked aircraft, a larger portion are expected to be retired compared to the pre-COVID-19 period, which directly impacts the Company in terms of number of new aircraft deliveries and financing opportunities, the ability of existing customers to meet current payment obligations and the value of aircraft in its portfolio. We continue to work closely with our customers to mitigate the risk. At the end of 2020 and 2019, 29.4% and 8.5% of the western-built commercial jet  aircraft  were  parked. Aircraft  valuations  could decline  if  significant  numbers  of  additional  aircraft,  particularly  types  with  relatively  few  operators,  are  placed  out  of service. See Overview to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impacts of COVID-19 on the airline industry environment.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing's Earnings from Operations for the BGS segment improved by $602 million compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher commercial services revenue. This upward trend in earnings continued into 2024, where BGS earnings from operations increased further by $289 million year-over-year, again due to strong commercial services performance. Boeing's investment in the BGS segment, as shown by its equity method investments, remained relatively stable, decreasing slightly from $384 million in 2023 to $391 million in 2024.

      "question": "How did the change in Caterpillar's non-accrual receivables without an allowance in the Mining segment from 2022 to 2024 reflect the company's evolving credit risk exposure in that sector?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar reported $1 million in non-accrual receivables without an allowance specifically in the Mining segment, indicating a small portion of receivables where no allowance for credit losses was deemed necessary. By 2024, Caterpillar continued to operate in the Mining segment, but the reported receivables in this segment grew to $8 million. This increase suggests a growing credit risk exposure in the Mining segment over this period, particularly in receivables where no allowance was set aside, potentially signaling either increased confidence in credit quality or a strategic shift in financing practices within this sector.",

        "Hop 1: [CAT](2022) \u2192 [Non-accrual Without an Allowance]: In 2022, Caterpillar reported $1 million in non-accrual receivables without an allowance specifically in the Mining segment.",
        "Hop 2: [Non-accrual Without an Allowance] \u2192 [Mining]: The Mining segment had $1 million in non-accrual receivables without an allowance in 2022, indicating a small but present credit risk.",
        "Hop 3: [Mining] \u2190 [CAT](2024): By 2024, Caterpillar's Mining segment reported $8 million in receivables, showing a significant increase from 2022."

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar reported that favorable price realization contributed to an increase in consolidated operating profit. Specifically, in 2021 (used for comparison in the 2022 report), price realization was a key factor in the $2.325 billion increase in operating profit compared to 2020. By 2024, ME&T, which encompasses Caterpillar\u2019s design, manufacturing, and marketing operations, continued to reflect the impact of pricing strategies. The 2024 supplemental consolidating data reaffirmed ME&T's central role in product development and manufacturing, which directly ties to how price realization affects profitability. This suggests that the company's ability to realize price increases\u2014likely through strategic pricing adjustments and geographic sales mix\u2014positively influenced ME&T's operating performance over the two-year period.",

Caterpillar management utilizes  these  charts  internally  to  visually  communicate  with  the  company's  Board  of  Directors  and  employees.  The  bar  entitled  Other  includes consolidating adjustments and Machinery, Energy &amp; Transportation other operating (income) expenses .\n\nOperating profit was $6.878 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.325 billion, or 51 percent, compared with $4.553 billion in 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization, higher profit from Financial Products and lower restructuring expenses (included in other), partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable  manufacturing  costs reflected increased freight and higher material costs. In addition, unfavorable period manufacturing costs were driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, and higher labor costs. Unfavorable period manufacturing costs were mostly offset by favorable cost absorption and lower warranty expense. Cost absorption was favorable as inventory increased more during 2021 than during 2020.\n\nHigher  SG&amp;A/R&amp;D  expenses  reflected  higher  short-term  incentive  compensation  expense  and  investments  aligned  with  the company's strategy for profitable growth, including higher labor costs and acquisition-related expenses.\n\nShort-term incentive compensation expense, which was reinstated in 2021, was $1.3 billion in 2021, compared to no short-term incentive compensation expense recognized in 2020. Short-term incentive compensation expense is directly related to financial and operational performance, measured against targets set annually. For 2022, we expect short-term incentive compensation expense will be about $1.0 billion.\n\nOperating profit margin was 13.5 percent in 2021, compared with 10.9 percent in 2020.\n\n",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, CAT's wholesale lease commitments declined from $46 million in 2022 to $30 million in 2024, reflecting a reduction in short-term lease financing provided through Cat Financial. This decline aligns with Cat Financial's strategic shift toward offering more sales-type leases, where the lessee is considered the tax owner of the equipment and often has a purchase option at the end of the lease term. This leasing model allows Cat Financial to better manage residual values, as they determine residual estimates based on factors like historical wholesale prices, usage, and market trends. Additionally, Cat Financial actively monitors and adjusts residual values during lease terms\u2014revising depreciation for operating leases and finance revenue for sales-type leases\u2014indicating a more strategic and dynamic approach to asset valuation and risk management in their leasing portfolio by 2024.",

For tax purposes, we are considered the owner of the equipment.\n\nCat Financial also purchases short-term receivables from Caterpillar.\n\nCat Financial's wholesale loans and leases include inventory/rental programs, which provide assistance to dealers by financing their new Caterpillar inventory and rental fleets.\n\nCat Financial operates in a highly competitive environment, with financing for users of Caterpillar equipment and services available through a variety of sources, principally commercial banks and finance and leasing companies.  Our competitors include Wells Fargo Equipment Finance Inc., Banc of America Leasing &amp; Capital LLC,  BNP  Paribas  Leasing  Solutions  Limited, Australia  and  New  Zealand  Banking  G roup  Limited,  Soci\u00e9t\u00e9  G \u00e9n\u00e9rale  S.A.  and  various  other  banks  and  finance companies.  In addition, many of the manufacturers that compete with Caterpillar also own financial subsidiaries, such as John Deere Capital Corporation, Komatsu Financial L.P., V olvo Financial Services and Kubota Credit Corporation, which utilize many below-market interest rate programs (funded by the manufacturer) to support machine sales.  Cat Financial works with the broader Caterpillar organization to provide a broad array of financial merchandising programs to compete around the world.\n\nThe financial results of Cat Financial are largely dependent upon the ability of Caterpillar dealers to sell equipment and customers' willingness to enter into financing or leasing agreements.  Cat Financial is also affected by, among other things, the availability of funds from its financing sources, its cost of funds relative to its competitors and general economic conditions such as inflation and market interest rates.\n\nCat Financial has a match-funding policy that addresses interest rate risk by aligning the interest rate profile (fix ed or floating rate and duration) of its debt portfolio with the interest rate profile of its receivables portfolio within predetermined ranges on an ongoing basis.  In connection with that policy, Cat Financial uses interest rate derivative instruments to modify the debt structure to match assets within the receivables portfolio. This matched funding reduces the volatility of margins between interest-bearing assets and interest-bearing liabilities, regardless of which direction interest rates move. For more information regarding match funding, please see Note 4 - 'Derivative financial instruments and risk management' of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\"  See also the risk factors associated with our financial products business included in Item 1A. of this Form 10-K.\n\nIn managing foreign currency risk for Cat Financial's operations, the objective is to minimize earnings volatility resulting from conversion and the remeasurement of net foreign currency balance sheet positions, and future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.  This policy allows the use of foreign currency forward, option  and  cross  currency  contracts  to  offset  the  risk  of  currency  mismatch  between  the  assets  and  liabilities,  and  ex change  rate  risk  associated  with  future transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\n\nCat  Financial  provides  financing  only  when  certain  criteria  are  met.  Credit  decisions  are  based  on  a  variety  of  credit  quality  factors  including  prior  payment experience, customer financial information, credit ratings, loan-to-value ratios and other internal metrics. Cat Financial typically maintains a security interest in retailfinanced equipment and generally requires physical damage insurance coverage on financed equipment.  Cat Financial finances a significant portion of Caterpillar dealers' sales and inventory of Caterpillar equipment throughout the world.  Cat Financial's competitive position is improved by marketing programs offered in conjunction with Caterpillar and/or Caterpillar dealers.  Under these programs, Caterpillar, or the dealer, funds an amount at the outset of the transaction, which Cat Financial then recognizes as revenue over the term of the financing.  We believe that these marketing programs provide Cat Financial a significant competitive advantage in financing Caterpillar products.",

Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales-type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax  leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax  purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment. Our lease agreements may include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fix ed price or fair market value.\n\nWe determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends.  We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total ex pected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\n\nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:",

      "question": "How did the allocation of credit facility funds to ME&T in 2022 influence the growth in Financial Products' liabilities by 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ME&T had access to $2.75 billion of the overall $10.50 billion credit facility, with specific allocations across the 364-day, three-year, and five-year facilities. This funding supported ME&T's operations in machinery, energy, and transportation, which in turn fed into the financing needs managed by Financial Products. By 2023, the liabilities of Financial Products had increased from $21,418 million to $23,612 million, suggesting that the earlier credit facility allocations to ME&T likely contributed to the growth in financing activities and associated liabilities within Financial Products during this period.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing reported a FAS/CAS service cost adjustment of $1,056 million, which represented the difference between GAAP pension costs and the amounts allocated to business segments. This adjustment was excluded from the Core Operating Loss (non-GAAP), indicating a strategic decision to isolate pension-related volatility from operational performance metrics. By 2024, the continued exclusion of this adjustment from Core Operating Loss suggests that Boeing maintained its approach to segment cost allocation, focusing on operational efficiency while managing legacy pension obligations separately. The persistence of this exclusion highlights a consistent financial reporting strategy, where non-operational pension impacts are separated to provide clearer insight into core business performance.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Collins Aerospace contributed $26,253 million to RTX's total business segment sales of $68,920 million, representing approximately 38.1% of the total. In 2024, this contribution increased to $28,284 million out of a total of $80,738 million, or about 35.0%. Despite the absolute increase in sales by $2,031 million, the percentage contribution decreased slightly, indicating that while Collins Aerospace remained a major contributor, other segments may have grown at a faster rate in 2024. This shift suggests a potential change in the internal dynamics of RTX's business portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: RTX(2023) \u2192 Collins Aerospace: Collins Aerospace was a major business segment of RTX in 2023, contributing $26,253 million in business segment sales.",

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX's Raytheon segment disaggregated its sales by contract type, which provided granular visibility into revenue composition and associated cost profiles. This level of detail helped identify how different contract structures (e.g., fixed-price vs. cost-plus) affected profitability and cost flows. By 2024, RTX reported a $6.2 billion organic increase in total cost of sales, largely attributed to growth in net sales at Raytheon and other segments. The 2023 disaggregation by contract type enabled better alignment of cost flows with revenue streams, suggesting that the cost increase in 2024 was likely driven by higher volumes in contract types with higher direct costs. This indicates a continuation of Raytheon's role in driving cost-of-sales trends, with improved transparency into how segment-level sales characteristics directly impact overall cost structure.",

      "answer": "MMM's Industrial Specialties Sales declined from $1,296 million in 2022 to $1,137 million in 2024, reflecting a broader shift in the company's Safety and Industrial segment dynamics. In 2022, MMM reported that the Safety and Industrial segment had net sales of $12,880 million, with industrial specialties contributing significantly to its revenue base. However, during 2023, MMM experienced a 5.6% decline in Safety and Industrial sales, with industrial specialties particularly affected by reduced consumer discretionary spending and a slowdown in e-commerce, which impacted packaging and shipping activity. This decline was compounded by the exit from Russia, which negatively impacted organic growth by 5.2 percentage points. By 2024, while overall Safety and Industrial sales were flat, industrial specialties continued to decline, attributed to a mixed industrial demand environment and a weaker EMEA manufacturing sector. Additionally, the Aearo-related litigation adjustments in 2023 shifted some financial burdens from the Safety and Industrial segment to Corporate and Unallocated, indirectly affecting the segment's operating income and strategic focus, which may have influenced investment and growth decisions in industrial specialties.",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe preceding table also displays business segment operating income (loss) information adjusted for special items. For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, GE reported a net unfavorable change in estimated profitability of $321 million at Aviation related to long-term service agreements, which were a key revenue driver for the Commercial Engines & Services (CES) segment. By 2024, CES represented approximately 70% of total revenue, with services accounting for 74% of CES revenue, indicating a strong continued reliance on service contracts. The equity method income from CES increased from $139 million in 2022 to $301 million in 2024, reflecting improved financial performance likely tied to stabilization or growth in service agreement profitability. This suggests that despite the 2022 profitability headwinds, GE's long-term service agreements contributed to a significant increase in CES equity income by 2024, demonstrating a recovery or strategic realignment in how these agreements were managed or priced.",

          "chunk_text": "ABOUT GE AEROSPACE. General Electric Company operates as GE Aerospace (GE Aerospace or the Company). GE Aerospace is a global aerospace leader with the industry's largest and growing commercial propulsion fleet. The Company's installed base of approximately 45,000 commercial and 25,000 military engines drives our aftermarket services business, which represents approximately 70% of revenue, reflecting the strength of customer demand across our business. Through FLIGHT DECK, the Company's proprietary lean operating model, GE Aerospace is prioritizing safety, quality, delivery and cost, to drive focused execution and bridge strategy to results. We are focused on delivering against our strategic priorities for today (services and readiness), tomorrow (delivering the production and services ramp for new engines) and the future (inventing next generation flight technology for our commercial and defense customers). Our global team is building on more than a century of innovation and learning, as we invent the future of flight, lift people up and bring them home safely.\n\nOn January 3, 2023, the Company completed the separation of its healthcare business into an independent publicly traded company, GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (GE HealthCare), and on April 2, 2024, the Company completed the separation of its GE V ernova business into an independent publicly traded company, GE Vernova, Inc. (GE Vernova). In connection with these separations, the historical results of GE HealthCare and GE V ernova, and certain assets and liabilities included in the separations, are reported in our consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations. See Note 2 for further information.\n\nWe serve customers in approximately 120 countries. M anufacturing and service operations are carried out at 67 facilities located in 22 states in the United States and Puerto Rico, of which 24 are owned, and at 67 facilities located in 24 other countries, of which 34 are owned.\n\nSEGMENTS. GE Aerospace operates through two reportable segments: Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies.\n\nCOMMERCIAL ENGINES &amp; SERVICES. Commercial Engines &amp; Services (CES) designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines for commercial airframes, as well as business aviation and aeroderivative applications. Services include maintenance, repair and overhaul (M RO) of engines and the sale of spare parts, and we offer services under a variety of arrangements such as long-term service agreements or time and material contracts. CES was approximately 70% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 74% of total CES revenue.\n\nOur CES customers for equipment and services consist primarily of airframers and airlines, including both Boeing and A irbus, and third-party M RO shops, to whom we sell equipment and license M RO technology. CES engines power aircraft in all commercial categories-narrowbody, widebody and regional-and this includes engines sold by joint venture partners, the most significant of which is CFM  International, a 50-50 non-consolidated joint venture with Safran A ircraft Engines, a subsidiary of Safran Group of France. Depending on the aircraft model, airline customers may have a choice between our engines and those of other manufacturers or, as in the case of some Boeing models, our engines may be the sole source engine for a particular aircraft.\n\nCommercial and financial dynamics for major engine platforms often play out over the course of many years, as new product development cycles are long and, after initial sale, commercial engines can operate for decades with services in the aftermarket. In the narrowbody aircraft segment, we are in the midst of a significant ramp in production of the LEA P engine, which entered into service in 2016 and is expected in the coming years to overtake the mature CFM 56 as the industry's most utilized narrowbody engine. This is expected to also drive a significant increase in shop visits and need for M RO capacity as LEA P engines come due for services. In the widebody aircraft segment, we have a range of engine platforms that are in different stages of their lifecycles. These include the more mature CF6 and GE90 engines, as well as the GEnx engine that entered into service in 2011 and the GE9X engine that will power the Boeing 777X  when that aircraft enters into serv ice. We also have engines that power regional and business aircraft.\n\nWe have been and remain committed to investing in developing and maturing technologies that enable a more sustainable future of flight. Notably, CFM International's Revolutionary Innovation for Sustainable Engines (RISE) program is a suite of pioneering technologies including Open Fan, compact core and hybrid electric systems for compatibility with alternative fuels. We recently completed more than 250 tests on developing a full-scale Open Fan engine. This is one of several initiativ es underway to help invent the future of flight.\n\nDEFENSE &amp; PROPULSION TECHNOLOGIES. Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies (DPT) is a leading provider of defense engines and critical aircraft systems, and it consists of our Defense &amp; Systems and Propulsion &amp; A dditive Technologies businesses. DPT was approximately 25% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2024, with services representing 56% of total DPT revenue.\n\nDefense &amp; Systems - Defense &amp; Systems designs, develops, manufactures and services jet engines and avionics and power systems for governments, militaries and commercial airframers. Services include M RO of engines and the sale of spare parts.\n\nOur product performance and dedication to innovation have earned long-standing relationships with airframers, shipyards, government agencies and other customers globally. We also regularly work with government customers on the development of classified and unclassified advanced products, including combat engines, hypersonics and unmanned applications. Recently, our team successfully demonstrated a hybrid electric propulsion system rated at one megawatt with the U.S. A rmy.\n\nOur defense engines power a wide variety of fighters, bombers, tankers, transport, helicopters and surveillance aircraft, as well as aeroderivative engines for marine applications. Significant product platforms include the F110, F404 and F414 for combat engines, the T408, T700 and T901 for rotorcraft engines and the LM2500 for mobility and marine engines.",

      "question": "How did the allocation of postretirement benefit liabilities to GE Vernova in 2023 impact GE's capital obligations in 2024, particularly in light of the $1.82 billion final capital contribution made to run-off insurance subsidiaries?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GE legally allocated a portion of its postretirement benefit liabilities to GE Vernova as part of its broader restructuring efforts, which included the spin-off of energy businesses. This transfer was intended to align liabilities with the new corporate structure and reduce GE Aerospace\u2019s (the remaining industrial entity) burden. However, despite this liability transfer, GE Aerospace still made a final capital contribution of $1.82 billion in Q1 2024 to its run-off insurance subsidiaries, indicating that the company retained significant financial obligations tied to legacy insurance operations. This suggests that while GE had formally reallocated liabilities to GE Vernova in 2023, it remained exposed to capital requirements in 2024 due to the run-off nature and statutory capital needs of its insurance business, even as it pursued strategic exits like the Canadian life and health insurance portfolio transaction.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell reported $122 million in severance costs and $122 million in exit costs for Performance Materials and Technologies as part of broader repositioning efforts. In 2023, exit costs for the same segment increased to $139 million, indicating a continued but intensified focus on restructuring. This evolution suggests that Honeywell likely deepened its strategic realignment within the segment, which includes UOP's operations focused on process technology and catalysts. The increased exit costs in 2023, compared to 2022, may reflect further site transitions or operational consolidations within UOP\u2019s footprint to enhance efficiency and align with long-term transformation goals.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GE acknowledged uncertainty about whether the aggregate market value of its common stock and the stock of the newly separated entities\u2014including GE Vernova\u2014would be equal to, greater than, or less than the pre-separation stock value. By 2024, this uncertainty had evolved into measurable financial impacts. Specifically, the deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses associated with GE Vernova dropped from $0.6 billion in 2023 to an insignificant amount in 2024, indicating a significant valuation adjustment. Additionally, GE disclosed that loss contingencies tied to GE Vernova and other discontinued operations remained unresolved, with financial impacts including potential warranty provisions and contract settlements, showing that the earlier market uncertainty had translated into concrete financial exposures.",

          "chunk_text": "INSURANCE AND INVESTMENT CONTRACTS. Refer to the Other Items - Insurance section for further discussion of the accounting estimates and assumptions in our insurance reserves and their sensitivity to change. See Notes 1 and 12 for further information.\n\nPENSION ASSUMPTIONS. Refer to Note 13 for our accounting estimates and assumptions related to our postretirement benefit plans.\n\nINCOME TAXES. Our annual tax rate is based on our income, statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and respective governmental taxing authorities. Significant judgment is required in determining our tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions, including evaluating uncertainties. We review our tax positions quarterly and adjust the balances as new information becomes available. Our income tax rate is significantly affected by the tax rate on our global operations. In addition to local country tax laws and regulations, this rate can depend on the extent earnings are indefinitely reinvested outside the U.S. Historically U.S. taxes were due upon repatriation of foreign earnings. Due to the enactment of U.S. tax reform in 2017, substantially all of our unrepatriated net earnings have been subject to U.S. tax and accordingly we expect to have the ability to repatriate available non-U.S. cash without significant additional tax cost. Indefinite reinvestment is determined by management's judgment about and intentions concerning the future operations of the Company. M ost of these earnings have been reinvested in active non-U.S. business operations. We reassess reinvestment of earnings on an ongoing basis.\n\nWe evaluate the recoverability of deferred income tax assets by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies, which rely on reasonable estimates. We use our historical experience and our short- and long-range business forecasts to provide insight. Further, our global and diversified business portfolio gives us the opportunity to employ various prudent and feasible tax planning strategies to facilitate the recoverability of future deductions. A mounts recorded for deferred tax assets related to non-U.S. net operating losses, net of valuation allowances, were $0.5 billion and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. Of this, an insignificant amount and $0.6 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023 respectively, were associated with losses reported in discontinued operations, primarily related to our GE V ernova, GE HealthCare and legacy financial services businesses. See Other Consolidated Information - Income Taxes section and Notes 1 and 15 for further information.\n\nLOSS CONTINGENCIES. Loss contingencies are existing conditions, situations or circumstances involving uncertainty as to possible loss that will ultimately be resolved when future events occur or fail to occur. Such contingencies include, but are not limited to, environmental, health and safety matters, litigation, regulatory investigations and proceedings, government contracts, employee benefit plans, product quality guarantees and losses resulting from other events and developments. In particular, the design, development, production and support of aerospace products is inherently complex and subject to risk. Technical issues associated with these products may arise in the normal course and may result in financial impacts, including increased warranty provisions, customer contract settlements, and changes in contract performance estimates. When a loss is considered probable and reasonably estimable, we record a liability in the amount of our best estimate for the ultimate loss. When there appears to be a range of possible costs with equal likelihood, liabilities are based on the low-end of such range. However, the likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a meaningful estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available and the potential effect of future events and negotiations with or decisions by third parties that will determine the ultimate resolution of the contingency. M oreover, it is not uncommon for such matters to be resolved over many years, during which time relevant developments and new information must be continuously evaluated to determine both the likelihood of potential loss and whether it is possible to reasonably estimate a range of possible loss. Disclosure is provided for material loss contingencies when a loss is probable but a reasonable estimate cannot be made, and when it is reasonably possible that a loss will be incurred or the amount of a loss will exceed the recorded provision. We regularly review contingencies to determine whether the likelihood of loss has changed and to assess whether a reasonable estimate of the loss or range of loss can be made. See Note 24 for further information.\n\n## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. Our run-off insurance operations include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumed long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumed long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc. (Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes (e.g., lifetime benefit periods, inflation protection options, and joint life policies) that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. Presented in the table below are reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2022, RTX's Net Products Cost of Sales increased by $3.0 billion, with Collins Aerospace contributing to this rise due to product sales changes, although this was partially offset by cost reduction initiatives. By 2023, Net Products Cost of Sales increased further by $1.5 billion, with Collins again playing a role in the upward trend due to continued product sales dynamics. Collins remained a key business segment in 2023, contributing significantly to commercial aerospace sales, particularly through major clients like Airbus, which accounted for 17% of total net sales in 2023.

      "answer": "In 2022, the BCA segment's loss from operations decreased by $706 million compared to 2021, driven by higher deliveries and lower abnormal production costs. However, by 2024, the BCA segment's loss from operations had increased by $6,334 million compared to 2023, primarily due to reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs, 737-9 customer considerations related to the January 2024 grounding, production disruptions including the IAM 751 work stoppage, and higher R&D expenses. This indicates a significant reversal in the BCA segment's trajectory, transforming it from a source of operational improvement in 2022 to a major contributor to increased losses by 2024.",

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC.\n\n118",

      "question": "How did the allocation of credit facility funds to ME&T in 2022 influence the intersegment eliminations with Financial Products, and how did this relationship affect the carrying value of Financial Products' liabilities in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2022, ME&T had access to $2.75 billion of the overall $10.50 billion credit facility, with specific allocations across the 364-day, three-year, and five-year facilities. This access likely supported ME&T's operational and financial activities, which were closely linked to Financial Products through intersegment transactions. In 2023, these intersegment relationships resulted in multiple eliminations between ME&T and Financial Products, including eliminations of revenues, interest expense, net expenses, discounts on receivables, and equity profits. These interdependencies contributed to the increase in Financial Products' liabilities, which rose from $21,418 million in 2022 to $23,612 million in 2023. The evolution of this relationship shows that ME&T's access to credit in 2022 had a cascading effect on the financial interlinkages and balance sheet size of Financial Products in 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX reported inter-segment sales of $159 million to Raytheon, which slightly decreased to $130 million in 2024. During this time, RTX increased its company-funded R&D spending by $0.1 billion in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily driven by higher investments in commercial program development at Collins and Pratt & Whitney. However, development spending at Raytheon declined, suggesting a strategic reallocation of R&D resources away from Raytheon and toward other segments. This shift in investment aligns with the slight reduction in inter-segment sales to Raytheon, indicating a potential prioritization of external growth areas over internal segment support within the company's broader strategic focus on innovation and program development.",

International  trav el  also  surpassed  pre-pandemic  lev els  during  2024  and  the  wide-body  market  continues  to  improv e  with  the international trav el recov ery. T he transition in the international commercial market from recov ery to normal market conditions is continuing to progress as China international trav el remains below 2019 lev els. We are experiencing strong demand from our airline customers globally.\n\nWe and our suppliers are experiencing supply chain disruptions as a result of production quality issues, global supply chain constraints, and labor instability. We and our suppliers are also experiencing inflationary pressures. We continue to monitor the health and stability of the supply chain. T hese factors hav e reduced ov erall productiv ity and adv ersely impacted our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nAirline  financial  performance,  which  influences  demand  for  new  capacity,  has  benefited  from  the  resilient  demand  for  trav el.  T he  International  Air Transport Association (IATA) is estimating 2024 industry-wide net profits of $31.5 billion, up from its forecast of $25.7 billion a year ago, primarily driv en by North America, Europe and the Middle East. For 2025, IATA is forecasting $36.6 billion in net profits for the industry globally. The ov erall outlook continues to stabilize as we face uncertainties in the env ironment in the near- to medium-term as airlines are facing persistently high and v olatile costs. The global economy is expecting a continued easing of inflation and interest rates, with regional economic and geopolitical difficulties adding uncertainty to the outlook and the financial v iability of some airlines and regions.\n\nThe long-term outlook for the industry remains positiv e due to the fundamental driv ers of air trav el demand: economic growth, increasing propensity to trav el due to increased trade, globalization and improv ed airline serv ices driv en by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. Our Commercial Market Outlook forecast projects a 3.2% growth rate in the global fleet ov er a 20-year period. Based on long-term global economic growth projections of 2.6%  in  av erage  annual  gross  domestic  product,  we  project  demand  for  approximately  43,975  new  airplanes  ov er  the  next  20  years.  T he  industry remains vulnerable to exogenous dev elopments including fuel price spikes, potential new or increased tariffs, changing energy policies, credit market shocks, acts of terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics, pandemics and increased global env ironmental regulations.\n\nAt BDS, we continue to see stable demand reflecting the important role our products and serv ices hav e in ensuring our national security. Outside of the U.S.,  we  are  seeing  similar  solid  demand  as  gov ernments  prioritize  security,  defense  technology  and  global  cooperation  giv en  ev olv ing  threats.  We continue to experience production disruptions and inefficiencies due to technical challenges, supplier disruption and factory performance. These factors have contributed to significant earnings charges on fixed-price dev elopment programs as well as on a number of mature programs which are continuing to adversely affect margins and cash flows.\n\nAt BGS, we expect commercial revenues to remain strong in future quarters as the commercial airline industry has largely recov ered and transitions to growth. The demand outlook for our gov ernment serv ices business remains stable.",

By 2023, this category for Mining dropped to $0 million, indicating a complete resolution or write-off of those long-overdue receivables.

      "answer": "In 2022, ME&T had access to $2.75 billion of the $10.50 billion total credit facility, with specific allocations including $825 million under a 364-day facility expiring in September 2022, $715 million under a three-year facility expiring in 2024, and $1.21 billion under a five-year facility expiring in 2026. By 2024, the Financial Products segment, which operates separately from ME&T, was engaged in derivative contracts governed by ISDA master netting agreements that allowed for net settlement of derivative balances. As of December 31, 2024, no cash collateral was pledged or received under these agreements, and the exposure to credit loss was limited to recorded but unpaid gains. This reflects a strategic separation between ME&T and Financial Products, with the former relying on credit facilities and the latter managing financial risk through derivative netting.",

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's treatment of currency exchange impacts change from 2022 to 2024, and what does this evolution suggest about the company's approach to financial risk management and earnings predictability?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar reported foreign currency exchange net gains, contributing favorably to other income/expense, with specific mention of impacts from the Chinese yuan, euro, and Australian dollar. By 2024, the company formalized the reporting of 'currency impacts' as a defined methodology difference between exchange rates used in U.S. GAAP and segment reporting, particularly for the Resource Industries segment. This evolution suggests Caterpillar adopted a more structured and transparent approach to managing foreign exchange risk, likely improving earnings predictability and investor confidence by clarifying the impact of currency fluctuations on financial performance.",

        "Hop 1: CAT(2022) \u2192 Currency Impacts: In 2022, CAT experienced favorable currency exchange gains, particularly from the Chinese yuan, euro, and Australian dollar, which positively impacted sales and other income/expense.",
        "Hop 2: Currency Impacts \u2192 Resource Industries: By 2024, Resource Industries explicitly disclosed 'currency impacts' as a defined reporting difference between U.S. GAAP and internal segment reporting exchange rates, indicating a formalized treatment of FX effects.",
        "Hop 3: Resource Industries \u2190 CAT(2024): CAT's 2024 10-K shows Resource Industries as a core operational segment with global manufacturing and distribution centers, suggesting the formalized FX reporting supports strategic transparency and risk management across its international footprint."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Other Profit/Loss and Tax Items\n\n- Interest  expense  excluding  Financial  Products  in  2021  was  $488  million,  compared  with  $514  million  in  2020.  The decrease was due to lower average debt outstanding during 2021, compared with 2020.\n- Other income/expense in 2021 was income of $1.814 billion, compared with expense of $44 million in 2020. The change was primarily due to mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans in 2021, compared with mark-to-market losses in 2020. Favorable impacts from foreign currency exchange gains (losses) and lower pension and OPEB plan costs also contributed to the change.\n\nThe company experienced foreign currency exchange net losses in 2020, compared with net gains in 2021.\n\n- The provision for income taxes for 2021 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 22.9 percent compared with 27.8 percent for 2020, excluding the discrete items discussed in the following paragraph. The decrease from 2020 was primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective.\n\nThe provision for income taxes for 2021 also included the following:\n\n- A  tax  charge  of  $190  million  related  to  $833  million  of  pension  and  OPEB  mark-to-market  gains  in  2021, compared to a $82 million tax benefit related to $383 million of mark-to-market losses in 2020.\n- A tax benefit of $36 million to reflect changes in estimates related to prior year's U.S. taxes in 2021 compared to $80 million in 2020.\n- A  tax  benefit  of  $63  million  in  2021,  compared  with  $49  million  in  2020,  for  the  settlement  of  stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense.\n- A tax benefit of $38 million in 2021 to recognize U.S. capital losses.\n\n## Construction Industries\n\nConstruction  Industries'  total  sales  were  $22.106  billion  in  2021,  an  increase  of  $5.188  billion,  or  31  percent,  compared  with $16.918 billion in 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization and favorable currency impacts related to the Chinese yuan, euro and Australian dollar. The increase in sales volume was driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories during 2020, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat during 2021.\n\n- In  North America,  sales  increased  due  to  higher  end-user  demand,  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories  and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories more in 2020 than in 2021.\n- Sales increased in Latin America primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand and favorable price realization. Dealers increased inventories during 2021, compared with a decrease in 2020.\n- In EAME, sales increased due to higher end-user demand, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and favorable currency impacts from a stronger euro and British pound. Dealers increased inventories during 2021, compared with a decrease in 2020.\n- Sales  increased  in  Asia/Pacific  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories  and  favorable  currency  impacts related  to  the  Chinese  yuan  and Australian  dollar.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  2020,  compared  with  a  slight increase in 2021.\n\nConstruction  Industries'  profit  was  $3.706  billion  in  2021,  an  increase  of  $1.333  billion,  or  56  percent,  compared  with  $2.373 billion in 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher material costs, increased variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and higher period manufacturing costs. The increase in period manufacturing costs was driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense and higher labor costs.\n\nHigher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were driven primarily by higher short-term incentive compensation expense.\n\nConstruction Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 16.8 percent in 2021, compared with 14.0 percent in 2020.",

      "answer": "The growth in Cat Financial's wholesale inventory receivables from $827M in 2022 to $1,415M in 2023 indicates a significant increase in short-term financing extended to dealers, which directly impacts the valuation of the Financial Products segment. According to the filings, the fair value of this segment rose from $20,686M in 2022 to $23,299M in 2023. This correlation suggests that the segment's valuation is closely tied to its portfolio of trade receivables, as evidenced by the explicit dependency shown in the consolidated statement of financial position where 'Financial Products' receivables-trade and other are directly tied to asset valuations. The increase in receivables likely contributed to the higher fair value of the segment by reflecting growth in its core asset base.",

By 2024, the organic increase in Total Cost of Sales (notably up $6.2 billion year-over-year) was directly tied to growth in net sales at the Collins Segment, among others. This indicates that Collins' expanding operations significantly drove cost increases, revealing a shift in RTX's cost structure where segment-level sales growth became a primary cost driver.

      "answer": "RTX's 2022 disclosures highlighted significant risks in integrating Raytheon's legacy operations with UTC's, including challenges in consolidating IT systems, retaining key employees, and achieving revenue synergies. These risks were grounded in the complexity of merging large, established aerospace entities with overlapping capabilities and customer bases. By 2024, the inter-segment sales figures revealed a notable imbalance: Collins Aerospace reported $2,355 million in internal sales, while Raytheon only achieved $143 million. This disparity suggests that while Collins Aerospace maintained strong internal collaboration and integration, Raytheon's integration may have lagged, potentially due to unresolved cultural, operational, or systems alignment issues mentioned in 2022. The low inter-segment sales for Raytheon could indicate that the anticipated cross-segment revenue synergies have not fully materialized, raising implications for RTX's long-term integration strategy and operational cohesion.",

We  also  implement  from  time  to  time  restructuring  plans,  which include or may result in workforce reductions, global facility reductions, procurement cost reduction activities, legal entity and operational reorganizations and other cost reduction initiatives. These strategic activities are complex and require the investment of resources including in personnel and systems. If we do not successfully manage our current or future strategic initiatives, expected efficiencies and benefits might be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted. In addition, certain U.S. government contracts and programs have begun to require digital engineering and other digital capabilities, and our inability to achieve these capabilities with respect to these programs timely may result in loss of revenues. Risks associated with workforce management issues include unfavorable political responses to such actions, unforeseen delays in the implementation of anticipated workforce reductions, additional unexpected costs, adverse effects on employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees or work stoppages. Any of the above factors may impair our ability to achieve anticipated benefits, or otherwise  harm  our  business,  or  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  competitive  position,  results  of  operations,  financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe May Be Unable to Successfully Integrate the Legacy Businesses of United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and Raytheon and Realize the Anticipated Benefits of the Raytheon Merger. The success of the Raytheon Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate UTC and Raytheon Company's legacy businesses, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities (including technology-driven revenue synergies) and operational efficiencies  from  the  Raytheon  Merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in orders by, customers.\n\nWe may face material challenges to the continued integration of the two companies, including, without limitation:\n\n- maintaining employee morale, retaining key management and other employees, and managing corporate culture;\n- retaining  existing  business  and  operational  relationships,  including  customers,  suppliers  and  employees  and  other counterparties, and attracting new business and operational relationships;\n- identifying and achieving revenue synergy opportunities among the legacy businesses; and\n- consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including unanticipated issues in integrating information technology, communications and other systems.\n\nThe impact and extent of these challenges is uncertain and many of them have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Any one  of  them  could  result  in  delays,  increased  costs,  decreases  in  the  amount  of  expected  revenues,  reduced  expected  cash generation,  and  diversion  of  management's  time  and  energy,  which  could  materially  affect  our  financial  condition,  results  of operations  and  liquidity.  In  addition,  we  must  continue  to  manage  the  integration  of  other  companies,  assets  and  businesses, including  the  integration  of  Rockwell  Collins,  which  UTC  acquired  on  November  26,  2018.  These  ongoing  (and  future) integrations  may  increase  the  complexity  of,  and  challenges  associated  with,  the  integration  of  UTC  and  Raytheon  Company's legacy businesses, which may make it more difficult for us to achieve the anticipated benefits of the Raytheon Merger fully, or within  the  anticipated  time  frame. The  actual  integration  may  result  in  additional  and  unforeseen  expenses,  and  the  anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses would be incurred, many of the expenses that may be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately, and changes to the estimates could affect the total amount or timing of integration expenses. These expenses could exceed benefits expected to be realized in connection with the Raytheon Merger.\n\nIf  We  Fail  to  Manage  Potential  Future  Acquisitions,  Investments,  Divestitures,  Joint  Ventures  and  Other  Transactions Successfully,  These Activities  Could  Adversely  Affect  Our  Future  Financial  Results. In  pursuing  our  business  strategies,  we continually  review,  evaluate  and  consider  potential  investments,  acquisitions,  divestitures,  joint  ventures  and  other  teaming  and collaborative  arrangements.  We  undertake  to  identify  opportunities  that  will  complement  our  existing  products  and  services  or customer  base,  as  well  as  expand  our  offerings  and  business  opportunities  into  new  areas  that  naturally  extend  from  our  core capabilities.  In  evaluating  such  transactions,  we  are  required  to  make  difficult  judgments  regarding  the  value  of  business opportunities, technologies and other assets, and the risks and cost of potential liabilities. Further, these transactions involve certain other risks and uncertainties including: (1) the risks involved with entering new markets; (2) the difficulty in integrating newlyacquired  businesses  and  managing  or  monitoring  other  collaborative  business  arrangements;  (3)  challenges  and  failures  in achieving strategic objectives and other expected benefits, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; (4) unidentified issues not discovered in RTC's due diligence; (5) the diversion of our attention and resources from our operations and other initiatives; (6) the potential impairment of acquired assets; (7) the performance of underlying products, capabilities or technologies; and (8) the potential loss of key employees and customers of acquired businesses. In addition, future transactions may impact our deployment of capital, including dividends, stock repurchases, pension contributions, and investments.\n\nWe May Not Be Able to Engage in Desirable Capital-Raising or Strategic Transactions.

By 2024, the combined business segment sales contribution to Raytheon (as a single segment) increased to $26,713 million. Despite this growth in sales, Raytheon experienced lower development program spending in 2024, as noted in the 2024 filing, where it was stated that the overall increase in company-funded R&D was partially offset by reduced expenses on development programs at Raytheon.

      "answer": "In 2022, UPS reported a Cash Balance Interest Credit Rate of 2.74% for International Pension Benefits. By 2023, this rate increased to 2.94%, indicating a higher assumed growth rate on pension balances. This change likely contributed to the increase in the Projected Benefit Obligation for International Pension Benefits, which rose from $311 in 2022 to $345 in 2023. However, despite this increase in obligations, the Fair Value of Plan Assets only marginally increased from $121 to $127, leaving a significant funding gap between the obligation and asset values.",

      "question": "How did the change in funding availability for Cat Financial between 2023 and 2024 impact its ability to support Caterpillar's equipment leasing activities, particularly in light of increased regulatory and market risks?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Cat Financial's operations were heavily dependent on funding availability, which directly affected its ability to provide financing and leasing options to Caterpillar dealers and customers. By 2024, global economic conditions and credit market volatility introduced new risks, as noted in the 10-K filing, where a failure to maintain credit ratings could increase borrowing costs and restrict access to capital markets. This funding pressure was compounded by Cat Financial\u2019s expanded leasing activities, including sales-type and tax leases, which required accurate residual value estimates and stable financial conditions to remain profitable. The increased regulatory scrutiny and market disruptions in 2024 placed additional strain on Cat Financial\u2019s liquidity, making it more challenging to sustain the same level of equipment financing support as in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT(2023) \u2192 Funding Availability: In 2023, Cat Financial's ability to offer financing and leasing options was directly tied to the availability of funds and its match-funding policy.",
        "Hop 2: Funding Availability \u2192 Cat Financial: By 2024, funding availability was negatively impacted by market volatility and potential credit rating downgrades, increasing borrowing costs and reducing access to capital markets.",

Changes in global economic conditions may result in customers experiencing increased difficulty in generating funds from operations. Capital and credit market volatility and uncertainty may cause financial institutions to revise their lending standards, resulting in customers' decreased access to capital. If capital and credit market volatility occurs, customers' liquidity may decline which, in turn, would reduce their ability to purchase our products.\n\n## Failure to maintain our credit ratings could increase our cost of borrowing and could adversely affect our cost of funds, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\n\nEach of Caterpillar's and Cat Financial's costs of borrowing and their respective ability to access the capital markets are affected not only by market conditions but also by the short- and long-term credit ratings assigned to their respective debt by the major credit rating agencies.  These ratings are based, in significant part, on each of Caterpillar's and Cat Financial's performance as measured by financial metrics such as net worth, profitability, interest coverage and leverage ratios, as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting.  There can be no assurance that Caterpillar and Cat Financial will be able to maintain their credit ratings. We receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies.  A downgrade of our credit rating by any of the major credit rating agencies could result in increased borrowing costs and could adversely affect Caterpillar's and Cat Financial's liquidity, competitive position and access to the capital markets, including restricting, in whole or in part, access to the commercial paper market.  There can be no assurance that the commercial paper market will continue to be a reliable source of short-term financing for Cat Financial or an available source of short-term financing for Caterpillar. An inability to access the capital markets could have an adverse effect on our cash flow, results of operations and financial condition.\n\n## Our Financial Products segment is subject to risks associated with the financial services industry.\n\nCat Financial is significant to our operations and provides financing support for a significant share of our global sales. The inability of Cat Financial to access funds to support its financing activities to our customers could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\nContinuing to meet Cat Financial's cash requirements over the long-term could require substantial liquidity and access to sources of funds, including capital and credit markets. Cat Financial has continued to maintain access to key global medium-term note and commercial paper markets, but there can be no assurance that such markets will continue to represent a reliable source of financing. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate, Cat Financial could face materially higher financing costs, become unable to access adequate funding to operate and grow its business and/or meet its debt service obligations as they mature. Cat Financial also could be required to draw upon contractually committed lending agreements and/or seek other funding sources. However, there can be no assurance that such agreements and other funding sources would be sufficient or even available under extreme market conditions. Any of these events could negatively impact Cat Financial's business, as well as our and Cat Financial's results of operations and financial condition.\n\nMarket disruption and volatility may also lead to numerous risks in connection with these events, including but not limited to:\n\n- Market developments that may affect customer confidence levels and cause declines in the demand for financing and adverse changes in payment patterns, causing increases in delinquencies and default rates, which could increase Cat Financial's write-offs and provision for credit losses.\n- The process Cat Financial uses to estimate losses inherent in its credit exposure requires a high degree of management's judgment regarding numerous subjective qualitative factors, including forecasts of economic conditions and how economic predictors might impair the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans.  Financial market disruption and volatility may impact the accuracy of these judgments.\n- Cat Financial's ability to engage in routine funding transactions or to borrow from other financial institutions on acceptable terms or at all could be adversely affected by disruptions in the capital markets or other events, including actions by rating agencies and deteriorating investor expectations.\n- As  Cat  Financial's  borrowing  agreements  are  primarily  with  financial  institutions,  their  ability  to  perform  in  accordance  with  any  of  our  underlying agreements could be adversely affected by market volatility and/or disruptions in financial markets.",

Cat Financial leases to customers primarily through sales-type (non-tax) leases, where the lessee for tax purposes is considered to be the owner of the equipment during the term of the lease. Cat Financial also offers tax  leases that are classified as either operating or direct finance leases for financial accounting purposes, depending on the characteristics of the lease. For tax  purposes, Cat Financial is considered the owner of the equipment. Our lease agreements may include options for the lessee to purchase the underlying asset at the end of the lease term for either a stated fix ed price or fair market value.\n\nWe determine the residual value of Cat Financial's leased equipment based on its estimated end-of-term market value.  We estimate the residual value of leased equipment at the inception of the lease based on a number of factors, including historical wholesale market sales prices, past remarketing experience and any known significant market/product trends.  We also consider the following critical factors in our residual value estimates: lease term, market size and demand, total ex pected hours of usage, machine configuration, application, location, model changes, quantities, third-party residual guarantees and contractual customer purchase options.\n\nDuring the term of our leases, we monitor residual values.  For operating leases, we record adjustments to depreciation expense reflecting changes in residual value estimates prospectively on a straight-line basis.  For finance leases, we recognize residual value adjustments through a reduction of finance revenue over the remaining lease term.\n\nSee Note 7 for contractual maturities of finance lease receivables (sales-type and direct finance leases).\n\nThe carrying amount of equipment leased to others, included in Property, plant and equipment - net in Statement 3, under operating leases was as follows:",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) saw a $706 million reduction in operational loss, attributed to higher deliveries and lower abnormal production costs. This marked a significant improvement from the $2,341 million loss in 2022 to $1,635 million in 2023. By 2024, Boeing's equity method investments in BCA and other segments totaled $391 million, reflecting a strategic decision to maintain or increase support for the segment following its improved performance.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, CAT's Resource Industries segment saw a decline in its sales and revenues contribution, dropping from $12,314 million in 2022 to $12,389 million in 2024, with a slight increase in 2023 to $13,583 million. Despite this relatively flat revenue trend, the segment\u2019s profitability improved, rising from $1,827 million in 2022 to $2,533 million in 2024. This indicates a shift in the segment's efficiency or cost structure, suggesting that while top-line growth stagnated, bottom-line performance strengthened. The segment\u2019s contribution to total company sales and revenues also decreased slightly, from 19.1% in 2022 to 17.5% in 2024, reflecting broader growth in other segments like Construction Industries and Energy & Transportation.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM's Transportation and Electronics segment contributed $8,902 million (34.0%) to total net sales, whereas in 2024, this contribution decreased to $8,380 million (34.1%). Despite a slight increase in the percentage share, the absolute dollar contribution from this segment declined, reflecting a shift in MMM's revenue distribution. The overall net sales for the company also decreased from $26,161 million in 2022 to $24,575 million in 2024, indicating a broader contraction in revenue. This decline in Transportation and Electronics' contribution was partially offset by relative stability in other segments like Safety and Industrial, which maintained a consistent 44.5% share over the period.",

        "Hop 1: MMM(2022) \u2192 Transportation and Electronics: In 2022, MMM's Transportation and Electronics segment reported net sales of $8,902 million, representing 34.0% of total company net sales.",
        "Hop 2: Transportation and Electronics \u2192 NetSales: The Transportation and Electronics segment directly contributes to MMM's overall net sales, with its performance influencing the company's total revenue.",
        "Hop 3: NetSales \u2190 MMM(2024): By 2024, the Transportation and Electronics segment's net sales had decreased to $8,380 million, now accounting for 34.1% of total company net sales of $24,575 million."

      "question": "How did the change in Cat Financial's mining-related finance receivables from $3 million in 2023 to $8 million in 2024 reflect Caterpillar's strategic shift in its Mining segment operations, and what does this imply about their financing support through Cat Financial?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Cat Financial's mining-related finance receivables were $3 million, indicating a relatively modest level of financing activity tied to the Mining segment. By 2024, this figure had increased to $8 million, representing a 167% growth. This significant increase suggests that Caterpillar strategically expanded its financial support for mining operations, likely to capitalize on growing demand in the mining industry. The evolution of this relationship implies that Caterpillar leveraged Cat Financial more heavily in 2024 to facilitate customer access to mining equipment, aligning with Caterpillar's broader operational focus on the Mining segment.",

The 2023 filings show that exclusivity assets are managed under a 5 to 25 year lifespan framework, which directly aligns with how patents and trademarks are also managed under the same 5 to 30 year range. This consistency in amortization timelines suggests RTX is applying similar strategic assumptions about asset longevity across different categories of intellectual property, reflecting a coordinated approach to managing its intangible asset portfolio.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing's BCA segment experienced a reduction in abnormal production costs, which contributed to a $706 million decrease in operational losses compared to 2022. This improvement was partially offset by increased R&D spending.

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing's BCA segment reported a loss from operations of $2,341 million, with $325 million in abnormal production costs tied to the 777X program. By 2024, BCA's loss from operations had surged to $7,969 million, largely due to $4,079 million in reach-forward losses specifically on the 777X and 767 programs. This indicates a significant deterioration in the financial health of the 777X program over the two-year period, as abnormal production costs for the 777X rose from $325 million in 2022 to $513 million in 2023, before culminating in massive reach-forward losses in 2024. The chain from BA(2022) \u2192 BCA \u2192 777X Program Reach-Forward Losses \u2190 BA(2024) reveals a clear and worsening trend in the program's financial performance, with operational challenges compounding over time.",

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium.

      "answer": "In 2022, the 'All Other' operating segment contributed $511 million out of CAT's total sales and revenues of $50,971 million, representing approximately 1.0% of total revenue. By 2023, total sales and revenues increased to $67,060 million, but there is no explicit disclosure of the 'All Other' segment\u2019s updated contribution. Given the lack of a disclosed increase for this segment and the significant growth in total revenues (up $16,089 million or 31.6% year-over-year), it is reasonable to infer that the 'All Other' segment remained a minor contributor in 2023, likely maintaining a similar proportion (around 1%) or less. This suggests that the segment continued to play a limited strategic role in the broader revenue structure, with CAT\u2019s growth primarily driven by its major operating segments.",

However, by 2024, the Consumer segment reported $13 million in asset-related and other expenses.

By 2024, operational disclosures indicated that supply chain disruptions were still impacting production and delivery timelines, despite strategic investments in manufacturing facilities and supplier partnerships aimed at improving yield and delivery performance. The lack of a significant increase in customer advances from 2023 to 2024 suggests that GE may not have fully resolved its production constraints, as ongoing supply chain issues likely limited their ability to convert these advances into completed deliveries. This reflects a continuation rather than resolution of prior-year challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (MD&amp;A). The consolidated financial statements of GE A erospace are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GA A P). Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Discussions throughout this M D&amp;A  are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. The M D&amp;A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered 'non-GAAP financial measures' under SEC rules. See the Non-GAAP Financial M easures section for the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GA A P financial measures.\n\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT. As a global aerospace company, our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic, and political factors on both a regional and global level. Demand for our equipment and services is demonstrated by our backlog of engine orders and services and growth in our installed base, and tends to follow commercial air travel and freight demand and government funding for defense budgets. We also expect a significant ramp in our delivery of engine units and services for newer product platforms in the years ahead to meet this demand. Refer to the Segment Operations sections for Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies below for additional detail about these dynamics for our commercial and defense businesses, respectively.\n\nGlobal material availability and supplier delivery performance continue to cause disruptions and have impacted our production and delivery of equipment and services to our customers. We are investing in our manufacturing facilities, overhaul facilities and our supply chain to increase production and strengthen yield in order to improve delivery to our customers. We continue to partner with our suppliers to improve material input, and work with our customers to calibrate future production rates. We are leveraging FLIGHT DECK and partnering with suppliers to improve material input and proactively manage the impact of inflationary pressure by driving cost productivity and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. We expect the impact of supply chain constraints and inflation will continue, and we are continuing to take action to mitigate the impacts.\n\nGiven the significant business we have with airframers and many airlines, challenges affecting the commercial aviation industry or key participants can adversely impact the demand for our products and services, the timing of orders, deliveries and related payments and other factors. We are monitoring the production and other challenges at The Boeing Company, and we continue to align with them on production expectations and assess potential impacts to our business. The Boeing worker's strike, resolved in the fourth quarter of 2024, had no significant impact to our revenue, earnings and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n\n",

      "question": "How did Collins Aerospace's increased sales from $21,152 million in 2023 to $26,253 million in 2024 align with RTX's capital investment decisions for the segment, particularly in terms of capital expenditures and total assets?",
      "answer": "Collins Aerospace's business segment sales increased from $21,152 million in 2023 to $26,253 million in 2024, reflecting a significant growth of $5,101 million. During the same period, RTX increased capital expenditures for Collins Aerospace from $628 million in 2023 to $786 million in 2024, while total assets for the segment remained relatively stable, rising slightly from $72,085 million to $72,372 million. This increase in capital investment aligns with the sales growth, suggesting a strategic allocation of resources to support the segment\u2019s expansion. The rise in capital expenditures indicates a focus on enhancing operational capacity or efficiency to meet the higher demand reflected in the sales figures.",

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13.798 billion, an increase of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, compared with $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

By 2023, the Health Care segment's organic sales growth had slowed to 0.7%, but was offset by a -3.1% impact from divestitures and a -0.4% translation effect, resulting in an overall -2.8% total sales change for the segment.

      "answer": "In 2022, GE reported a total pension deficit of $15,341 million, reflecting a significant gap between benefit obligations and the fair value of plan assets. By 2024, this deficit had decreased to $5,548 million, indicating a notable improvement in the funding status of the pension plans. This change suggests that GE implemented a more effective pension funding strategy over the two-year period, likely involving increased contributions or improved asset performance, particularly in plans subject to regulatory funding requirements. The shift from a large deficit to a smaller one demonstrates a strategic move toward strengthening pension fund solvency.",

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's non-accrual finance receivables without an allowance in the Mining segment change from 2022 to 2023, and what does this indicate about their credit risk exposure in this key business segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar reported $1 million in non-accrual finance receivables without an allowance specifically for the Mining segment. By 2023, this category showed no balance in the Mining segment, indicating a reduction in high-risk receivables. This change suggests Caterpillar may have improved its credit management or reduced financing exposure in the Mining industry, as evidenced by the Mining segment's 2023 receivables being entirely categorized under 'Current' with $863 million or fully performing with no delinquencies reported.",

      "question": "How did the decline in MMM's Industrial Specialties Sales from 2023 to 2024 reflect changes in the Safety and Industrial segment's performance, particularly in relation to shifts in end-market demand and strategic adjustments following the spin-off of the Health Care business?",
      "answer": "MMM's Industrial Specialties Sales decreased from $1,180 million in 2023 to $1,137 million in 2024, reflecting a continuation of declining demand in discretionary markets. This decline was consistent with the Safety and Industrial segment's broader performance: sales were flat in 2024 after a 5.6% decline in 2023. In 2023, the segment cited declining industrial specialties sales due to reduced consumer discretionary spending and e-commerce slowdowns, which impacted packaging and shipping activity. By 2024, while some areas like industrial adhesives and tapes showed growth, industrial specialties remained a drag on organic sales. The segment's operating income margins improved year-over-year, driven by productivity and spending discipline, but were partially offset by dis-synergies from the spin-off of the Health Care business (Solventum). Thus, the ongoing decline in Industrial Specialties Sales highlights persistent weakness in certain end markets, even as MMM implemented strategic cost and growth initiatives post-spin-off.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing's increased research and development spending contributed to a $706 million decrease in BCA's operational loss compared to 2022, despite partially offsetting the benefits from higher deliveries and lower abnormal production costs. This suggests that while R&D spending was a drag on short-term profitability, it may have supported longer-term strategic goals. In 2024, Boeing maintained its strategic focus on BCA by investing $391 million through the equity method, compared to $384 million in 2023, indicating continued confidence in the segment's future performance despite near-term financial pressures from R&D investments.",

        "Hop 2: Higher Research and Development Spending \u2192 BCA: The increased R&D spending is directly tied to BCA's operational performance, as it both supported improvements in deliveries and added to period expenses, affecting the segment's overall loss.",

      "answer": "The 1% increase in FedEx Ground's average daily volume in 2024, driven by demand for commercial and economy services, reflects the success of cost optimization initiatives such as the DRIVE program, which improved linehaul efficiencies and dock productivity in 2023. These operational improvements, including lower self-insurance accruals and reduced purchased transportation expenses, contributed to a 29% increase in FedEx Ground's operating income in 2024. This strong financial performance aligns with the 2022 goodwill evaluation, where FedEx Ground's fair value exceeded carrying value, indicating continued confidence in the segment's long-term value and supporting the conclusion that no impairment was necessary.",

          "chunk_text": "Goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment. In our evaluation of goodwill impairment, we perform a qualitative assessment that requires management judgment and the use of estimates to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. An entity has an unconditional option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test. An entity may resume performing the qualitative assessment in any subsequent period. We performed both qualitative and quantitative assessments of goodwill in the fourth quarter of 2022 and 2021. This included comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value (including attributable goodwill). Fair value is estimated using standard valuation methodologies (principally the income or market approach classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy) incorporating market participant considerations and management's assumptions on revenue growth rates, operating margins, discount rates, and expected capital expenditures. Estimates used by management can significantly affect the outcome of the impairment test. Changes in forecasted operating results and other assumptions could materially affect these estimates.\n\nAs part of our qualitative assessment, we consider changes in the macroeconomic environment such as the general economic conditions, limitations on accessing capital, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, and other developments in equity and credit markets.\n\nThe market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics such as operating value to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. We apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, growth, size, and risk profile relative to our reporting units. Changes to our selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.\n\nOur reporting units with significant recorded goodwill include FedEx Express, FedEx Ground, and FedEx Freight. We evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2022 and 2021 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2022 and 2021; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates.\n\n## LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES\n\nWe are subject to various loss contingencies in connection with our operations. Contingent liabilities are difficult to measure, as their measurement is subject to multiple factors that are not easily predicted or projected. Further, additional complexity in measuring these liabilities arises due to the various jurisdictions in which these matters occur, which makes our ability to predict their outcome highly uncertain. Moreover, different accounting rules must be employed to account for these items based on the nature of the contingency. Accordingly, significant management judgment is required to assess these matters and to make determinations about the measurement of a liability, if any. Certain pending loss contingencies are described in Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. In the opinion of management, the aggregate liability, if any, of individual matters or groups of related matters not specifically described in Note 19 is not expected to be material to our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. The following describes our methods and associated processes for evaluating these matters.\n\nBecause of the complex environment in which we operate, we are subject to numerous legal proceedings and claims, including those relating to general commercial matters, governmental enforcement actions, employment-related claims, and FedEx Ground's service providers. Accounting guidance for contingencies requires an accrual of estimated loss from a contingency, such as a nonincome tax or other legal proceeding or claim, when it is probable (i.e., the future event or events are likely to occur) that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. This guidance also requires disclosure of a loss contingency matter when, in management's judgment, a material loss is reasonably possible or probable.\n\nDuring the preparation of our financial statements, we evaluate our contingencies to determine whether it is probable, reasonably possible, or remote that a liability has been incurred. A loss is recognized for all contingencies deemed probable and estimable, regardless of amount. For unresolved contingencies with potentially material exposure that are deemed reasonably possible, we evaluate whether a potential loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.\n\nOur evaluation of these matters is the result of a comprehensive process designed to ensure that accounting recognition of a loss or disclosure of these contingencies is made in a timely manner and involves our legal and accounting personnel, as well as external counsel where applicable. The process includes regular communications during each quarter and scheduled meetings shortly before the completion of our financial statements to evaluate any new legal proceedings and the status of existing matters.",

      "answer": "In 2022, 3M reported that Separation and Purification Sales were among the organic growth drivers within the Health Care segment, benefiting from sustained demand for biopharma filtration solutions tied to vaccine and therapeutic development. This growth contributed to the segment's overall performance, with Health Care sales rising 8.4% in 2021 and showing strength in multiple subcategories. However, by 2024, following the April 2024 Separation of Solventum (formerly part of the Health Care segment), 3M disclosed that former Health Care-related costs were now being reflected in Corporate and Unallocated expenses. Specifically, Other corporate expense-net decreased year-over-year in 2024 due in part to the reclassification of certain Solventum-related costs previously allocated to the Health Care segment. Thus, the earlier growth in Separation and Purification Sales was part of a segment that was later restructured, with its legacy costs now influencing corporate-level financials post-divestiture.",

Because Corporate and Unallocated and Other include a variety of miscellaneous items, they are subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. Corporate and Unallocated and Other are presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 22.\n\n- Corporate and Unallocated operating income (loss) includes 'corporate special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'.\n- Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters. In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were also included in corporate special items. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were not included in the Corporate net costs for significant litigation special item, instead being reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Corporate special items for the periods presented also include divestiture costs, gain on business divestitures, divestiture-related restructuring actions and Russia ex it charges/benefits. Divestiture costs include costs that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\n- Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details on the impact of special items for additional information on the components of corporate special items. Corporate special item net costs decreased year-over-year in 2024, primarily due to lower net costs for significant litigation associated with Corporate and Unallocated. Corporate special item net costs increased year-over-year in 2023, primarily due to increased net costs for significant litigation as a result of pre-tax  charges of $10.3 billion and $4.2 billion in the second and third quarters of 2023 related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement, respectively (both discussed in Note 19), and lower gains on business divestitures.\n- Other corporate expense-net includes certain enterprise and governance activities resulting in unallocated corporate costs and other activity and net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations, commercial activity with Solventum postSeparation, and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Other corporate operating expenses, net, decreased year-over-year in 2024 primarily due to the extent of non-discontinued operationseligible former Solventum-allocated costs included in Corporate and Unallocated prior to Solventum's April 2024 Separation. Other corporate operating expenses, net, increased year-over-year in 2023 primarily due to higher restructuring charges (see Note 6).\n\n## \u00b7 Other:\n\n- This category principally reflects activity associated with:\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operating income categorized as \"Other\" decreased year-over-year in 2024 primarily due to the extent of transition arrangement income from divested businesses (and associated costs) largely related to Solventum, which separated in April 2024. Operating income categorized as \"Other\" decreased year-over-year in 2023 as a result of divestiture of the Food Safety Division and dental local anesthetic businesses (both formerly part of the \"Other\" category) and the extent of transition arrangement income from divested businesses other than Solventum.",

GE announced it plans to form three public companies focused on the growth sectors of aviation, healthcare and energy . In November 2021, we announced a strategic plan to form three industry-leading, global, investment-grade public companies from our (i) Aviation business, (ii) Healthcare business and (iii) Renewable Energy, Power and Digital businesses that we will combine. We intend to pursue a tax-free spin-off of Healthcare in early 2023, creating a pure play company at the center of precision health, and we expect to retain a stake of 19.9% in the new company. We intend to pursue a taxfree spin-off of the combined Renewable Energy, Power and Digital businesses in early 2024, and that new company will be positioned to lead the energy transition. Following these transactions, GE will be an aviation-focused company, shaping the future of flight. As independently run companies, each can benefit from greater focus, tailored capital allocation, and strategic flexibility to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors and employees. The respective capital structures, brands and leadership teams for each independent company will be determined and announced later.\n\nCoronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic . The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted global economies, resulting in workforce and travel restrictions, supply chain and production disruptions and reduced demand and spending across many sectors. Since the latter part of the first quarter of 2020, these factors have had a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. While factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic have been impacting operations and financial performance at varying levels across all our businesses, the most significant impact to date has been at our Aviation segment. For details about impacts related to our businesses and actions we have taken in response, as applicable, refer to the respective segment sections within MD&amp;A. We anticipate that our operations and financial performance will continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in future periods. These impacts will ultimately depend on many factors that are not within our control, including the severity and duration of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals' actions in response to the pandemic; the emergence of COVID-19 virus variants; and the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments and vaccines.\n\nGECAS . On November 1, 2021, we completed the combination of our GECAS business with AerCap and received $22.6 billion in cash, subject to future closing adjustments, 111.5 million shares of AerCap common stock (approximately 46% ownership interest) valued at approximately $6.6 billion based on AerCap's closing share price on October 29, 2021, and a $1.0 billion AerCap senior note. In connection with the closing of the transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash after-tax charge of $3.9 billion in discontinued operations in 2021, including a loss of $0.2 billion in the fourth quarter. Additionally, we have elected to prospectively measure our investment in AerCap at fair value and expect to have continuing involvement with AerCap, primarily through our ownership interest and ongoing sales or leases of products and services. We expect to fully monetize our stake in AerCap over time. See Notes 2 and 3 for further information.\n\nLiability Management Actions. During 2021, we completed debt tenders to repurchase a total of $32.6 billion of debt, comprising $7.3 billion in the second quarter of 2021 and $25.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021. The total after-tax loss on these actions was $6.1 billion ($6.5 billion pre-tax), comprising an after-tax loss of $1.1 billion ($1.4 billion pre-tax) in the second quarter of 2021 and an after-tax loss of $5.0 billion ($5.1 billion pre-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2021. The majority of the loss relates to the present value of accelerating future interest payments associated with the debt. As a result of these actions, we expect lower interest expense going forward.\n\nFactoring . Effective April 1, 2021, we discontinued the majority of our factoring programs and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we subsequently discontinued our remaining unconsolidated receivables facility. For the nine months ended December 31, 2021, the adverse impact to GE businesses' cash flows from operating activities (CFOA) was $5.1 billion, including $1.6 billion related to the unconsolidated receivables facility in the fourth quarter, which primarily represents the cash that our industrial businesses would have otherwise collected in the period had customer receivables not been previously sold and is excluded from free cash flows*. The adverse CFOA impact associated with activity in factoring programs that have now been discontinued was $5.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nReverse Stock Split. In the second quarter of 2021, we announced that we would proceed with the 1-for-8 reverse stock split, as approved by shareholders, and filed an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to effectuate the reverse stock split after the close of trading on July 30, 2021. GE common stock began trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 2, 2021. Our shares of outstanding common stock and earnings per share calculation have been retroactively restated for all periods presented.\n\nBK Medical. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we acquired BK Medical, a leader in surgical ultrasound imaging and guidance, from Altaris Capital Partners for a cash purchase price of $1.5 billion.",

      "question": "How did the significant gain on the sale of the Climate Technologies business segment in 2023 impact EMR's financial performance in that year, and how does this compare to the absence of such gains in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2023, EMR recorded a substantial gain on the sale of its Climate Technologies business segment, amounting to $10,610 million, which significantly boosted its earnings before income taxes to $11,124 million and net earnings to $8,809 million. In contrast, by 2024, the Climate Technologies segment no longer contributed to EMR's financials, as indicated by the absence of net sales and the reduced gain on sale of business to just $539 million, resulting in a much lower earnings before income taxes of $435 million and net earnings of $350 million. This illustrates a dramatic shift in EMR's financial performance due to the divestiture of the Climate Technologies segment.",

        "Hop 1: EMR(2023) \u2192 Gain on Sale of Business: EMR reported a gain of $10,610 million from the sale of the Climate Technologies segment in 2023.",

      "question": "How did the change in MMM's Accrued Income Taxes from 2023 to 2024 influence the Net UTB's impact on the effective tax rate, and what does this reveal about the company's resolution or emergence of tax position uncertainties during this period?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MMM reported Accrued Income Taxes of $218 million, and the Net UTB, which includes Accrued Income Taxes among other components, had a potential impact of $884 million on the effective tax rate. By 2024, the Net UTB's impact on the effective tax rate had decreased to $686 million, a reduction of $198 million. This decline suggests that MMM resolved certain tax uncertainties during the period, as the Net UTB is adjusted for deferred items, interest, penalties, and deductible taxes\u2014many of which are tied to the Accrued Income Taxes balance. The relationship described in the 2023 filing confirms that Net UTB is included in Accrued Income Taxes on the balance sheet, making the evolution of this liability directly relevant to the effective tax rate implications.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar's Financial Products segment reported an $89 million gain under 'Other income (expense)', indicating a positive financial contribution that was separate from the ME&T segment, which primarily focuses on equipment design and manufacturing. The two segments were clearly delineated in their financial reporting, with Consolidating Adjustments used to eliminate inter-segment transactions. By 2023, the ME&T segment was explicitly operating under ISDA master netting agreements with Financial Products, allowing for net settlement of derivative contracts. This suggests a more integrated approach to managing derivative exposures between the two segments compared to 2022, where the segments were treated more independently in financial disclosures.",

      "answer": "Boeing's 2022 earnings from operations were negatively impacted by significant reach-forward losses on fixed-price development programs such as KC-46A Tanker ($1,320 million in 2020) and VC-25B ($318 million in Q1 2021), which continued to create financial pressure through 2022. However, BGS had begun a recovery in 2021, with earnings from operations increasing by $1,567 million compared to 2020, driven by recovery from pandemic-related charges and higher commercial services volume. This improvement in BGS\u2019s financial performance laid the groundwork for Boeing to increase its strategic investments in equity method ventures associated with BGS in 2023, as evidenced by a rise in investment balances from $361 million in 2022 to $384 million in 2023. The year-over-year contrast shows that despite ongoing losses in fixed-price programs, the strengthening of BGS supported a renewed investment push in 2023.",

The $168 million reach-forward loss in the first quarter of 2020 on VC-25B was associated with engineering inefficiencies from the COVID-19 environment.\n\nBDS  earnings  from  operations  in  2020  decreased  by  $1,076  million  compared  with  2019  primarily  due  to  the unfavorable impact of cumulative contract catch-up adjustments, which were $828 million higher than the prior year, largely due to higher charges in 2020 of $1,320 million on KC-46A Tanker and $168 million on VC-25B, offset by $489 million in charges on Commercial Crew in 2019. The lower earnings in 2020 also reflect lower gains on property sales compared to the same period in 2019. These current period decreases were partially offset by the volume increases described above.\n\nBDS earnings from operations includes our share of income or loss from equity method investments of $53 million, $141 million and $128 million primarily from our ULA and non-U.S. joint ventures in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Backlog\n\nTotal backlog of $59,828 million at December 31, 2021 was $1,019 million lower than December 31, 2020 due to the timing of awards and revenue recognized.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nOur BDS business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. In these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. Examples of these programs include Ground-based Midcourse Defense, Proprietary and Space Launch System programs.\n\nSome of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis, and BDS customers are increasingly seeking fixed-price proposals for new programs. Examples of significant fixed-price development programs include Commercial Crew,  KC-46A  Tanker,  MQ-25,  T-7A  Red  Hawk,  VC-25B,  and  commercial  and  military  satellites.  A  number  of  our ongoing fixed-price development programs have reach-forward losses. New programs could also have risk for reachforward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Many development programs have highly complex designs. As technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which  could  result  in  a  material  charge  or  otherwise  adversely  affect  our  financial  condition.  These  programs  are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery  dates  could  be  extended,  which  could  trigger  termination  provisions,  the  loss  of  satellite  in-orbit incentive payments or other financially significant exposure. Risk remains that we may be required to record additional reach-forward losses in future periods.",

By 2024, the amortization periods for both Patents and Trademarks and Exclusivity Assets were standardized at 5 to 30 years and 5 to 25 years, respectively.

      "answer": "In 2022, LMT reported intersegment sales to Rotary and Mission Systems at $1,895 million, indicating consistent internal demand for the segment's capabilities. This level of internal revenue contribution suggests that the segment played a significant role in supporting other business units. By 2023, the assets attributed to Rotary and Mission Systems totaled $17,521 million, a decrease from $17,988 million in 2022. The slight decline in asset valuation despite sustained intersegment sales could indicate either asset efficiency improvements or a strategic rebalancing within the segment. This dynamic suggests that while Rotary and Mission Systems remains a substantial part of LMT\u2019s business, its internal strategic positioning may be evolving, particularly if the company is optimizing asset deployment while maintaining internal revenue flows.",

      "answer": "In 2022, RTX's Net Services Cost of Sales increased by $0.9 billion compared to 2021, with Collins Aerospace contributing to this rise due to higher external services cost of sales. This indicates that Collins' cost structure was a key driver in the growth of RTX's services cost base. By 2023, Collins remained a significant contributor to RTX's commercial aerospace sales, representing 14% of total net sales in 2022 and 17% in 2023 before discounts, suggesting that the cost relationship between Net Services Cost of Sales and Collins likely intensified. The 2023 data shows that Collins continued to influence RTX's cost structure, with Net Services Cost of Sales rising by $1.9 billion year-over-year, partly due to increases at Collins, indicating a deepening of the cost linkage between the segment and the overall services cost of sales.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM reported an Other Corporate Expense-Net of $176 million, which included corporate philanthropic activity among other unallocated costs. In 2023, the company continued to classify corporate philanthropic activity under Other Corporate Expense-Net, indicating that philanthropy remained a consistent component of unallocated expenses. However, the overall structure of Corporate and Unallocated expenses evolved in 2023 with the inclusion of additional special items such as PFAS-related litigation costs, divestiture-related restructuring, and Russia exit costs. This evolution suggests that while philanthropy remained a steady priority, the company's unallocated cost structure became more complex due to external legal and strategic factors, reflecting a shift in strategic priorities toward managing litigation and restructuring.",

The primary noncontrolling interest relates to 3M India Limited, of which 3M's effective ownership is 75 percent.\n\n## PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT\n\nItem 1, Business Segments, provides an overview of 3M's business segments. In addition, disclosures relating to 3M's business segments are provided in Note 19. Effective in the first quarter of 2021, the measure of segment operating performance used by 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM) changed and, as a result, 3M's disclosed measure of segment profit/loss (business segment operating income) was updated for all comparative periods presented. The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments (see Note 19 for additional details).\n\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments. The reportable segments are Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer.\n\n## Corporate and Unallocated:\n\nIn addition to these four business segments, 3M assigns certain costs to 'Corporate and Unallocated,' which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 19. Corporate and Unallocated operating income includes 'special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'. Special items include significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, certain litigation and environmental expenses largely related to legacy products/businesses not allocated to business segments, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments.

      "question": "How did the increase in RTX's Business Segment Sales from 2022 to 2023 impact the performance and contribution of the Raytheon segment in terms of both sales and operational focus?",
      "answer": "In 2022, RTX's Business Segment Sales totaled $56,587 million, with the Raytheon segment contributing $11,069 million in sales, split between Intelligence & Space ($8,704 million) and Missiles & Defense ($6,906 million). By 2023, RTX\u2019s total Business Segment Sales rose to $68,920 million, with Raytheon\u2019s contribution increasing to $26,350 million, driven by a significant rise in U.S. government sales to $19,965 million. This indicates a strategic shift toward strengthening Raytheon\u2019s role in defense and government contracts, as the segment\u2019s proportion of total business segment sales grew from about 19.6% in 2022 to nearly 38.2% in 2023. The evolution of this relationship shows a deepening strategic emphasis on Raytheon\u2019s defense capabilities within RTX\u2019s overall portfolio.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: RTX(2022) \u2192 Business segment sales: RTX reported total Business Segment Sales of $56,587 million in 2022, with Raytheon contributing $11,069 million across its sub-segments.",
        "Hop 2: Business segment sales \u2192 Raytheon: In 2023, Raytheon's segment sales increased significantly to $26,350 million, making it the second-largest contributor after Collins Aerospace within the business segment sales structure.",
        "Hop 3: Raytheon \u2190 RTX(2023): By 2023, Raytheon's sales composition showed a marked emphasis on U.S. government contracts, rising to $19,965 million, indicating a strategic pivot within RTX to leverage Raytheon\u2019s defense capabilities more heavily."

      "question": "How did Boeing's 2022 disclosure of the 787 Program reach-forward loss connect to its 2024 investment strategy in BCA, and what does this imply about the company's approach to addressing prior financial challenges in the commercial aircraft segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing disclosed a $3,460 million reach-forward loss on the 787 Program, which significantly contributed to BCA's operational losses. This loss highlighted ongoing production issues, abnormal costs, and margin pressures in the commercial aircraft segment. The connection between the 787 Program and BCA is clear, as the former directly impacted the latter's financial health. By 2024, Boeing's investment in BCA stood at $391 million, showing a modest increase from $384 million in 2023. This slight upward trend suggests Boeing continued to support BCA despite past losses, likely to stabilize the segment and address the challenges identified in 2022. The persistence of investment indicates a strategic commitment to restoring BCA\u2019s profitability and operational performance in the long term.",

The 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787 program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million and additional drivers as noted in the paragraph below.\n\nBCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,  $2,567  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  related  to  737  MAX,  $623  million  of  severance  cost,  $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  in  the  first  half  of  2020  from  the  temporary  suspension  of  operations  in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction  in  the  accounting  quantity  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  also  contributed  to  lower  earnings.  The  2019  loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nLower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.\n\n## Backlog\n\nOur  total  backlog  represents  the  estimated  transaction  prices  on  unsatisfied  and  partially  satisfied  performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiving approval from its board of directors, shareholders or government or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. Backlog excludes options and BCC orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may have contractual  remedies,  including  rights  to  reject  individual  airplane  deliveries  if  the  actual  delivery  date  is significantly later than the contractual delivery date.

      "answer": "In 2022, CAT's Resource Industries segment generated $9.5 billion in external sales and revenues, accounting for approximately 18.7% of CAT's total external revenues of $50.971 billion. By 2023, CAT's total revenues increased by 15% to $67.060 billion. This suggests that while Resource Industries remained a significant contributor, the overall revenue growth outpaced what would be expected from the segment's historical contribution alone, indicating either stronger performance within the segment or growth driven by other business units.

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar reported $22,106 million in total sales and revenues for the Construction Industries segment, reflecting strong demand across regions. This growth was followed by an increase in capital expenditures for the same segment from $271 million in 2022 to $376 million in 2023. The significant rise in capital spending suggests Caterpillar strategically prioritized scaling infrastructure and production capabilities in response to the segment's strong performance, aiming to sustain or enhance its market position in construction equipment and services.",

Caterpillar management utilizes these charts internally to visually communicate with the company's Board of Directors and employees.\n\nTotal sales and revenues for the fourth quarter of 2021 were $13.798 billion, an increase of $2.563 billion, or 23 percent, compared with $11.235 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The increase was mostly due to higher sales volume, driven by higher end-user demand for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  along  with  favorable  price  realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to remaining about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales were higher across the three primary segments.\n\nNorth America  sales  increased  29  percent  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories,  higher  end-user  demand  for services  and  favorable  price  realization.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020,  compared  with  dealer inventories that were about flat during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nSales increased 40 percent in Latin America primarily due to higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization.\n\nEAME sales  increased  24  percent  primarily  due  to  higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  services  and  the  impact  from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories more during the fourth quarter of 2020 than during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nAsia/Pacific sales increased 9 percent primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand for equipment and services and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared with an increase during the fourth quarter of 2021.\n\nDealers decreased inventories about $1.100 billion during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to a decrease of about $100 million during the fourth quarter of 2021. Dealers are independent, and the reasons for changes in their inventory levels vary, including their expectations of future demand and product delivery times. Dealers' demand expectations take into account seasonal changes, macroeconomic conditions, machine rental rates and other factors. Delivery times can vary based on availability of product from Caterpillar factories and product distribution centers.",

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, intersegment sales directed to Rotary and Mission Systems increased from $1,895M to $2,320M, indicating a growing internal investment in that segment. This increase aligns with Lockheed Martin's 2024 operational expansion for Rotary and Mission Systems, which included significant facilities in Stratford, Connecticut; Orlando, Florida; Moorestown/Mt. Laurel, New Jersey; Owego and Syracuse, New York; Manassas, Virginia; and Mielec, Poland. The rise in intersegment sales likely supported the infrastructure and operational needs tied to these locations, suggesting a strategic focus on scaling this segment.",

      "answer": "RTX's Consolidated Net Sales from Pratt & Whitney increased from $18,150 million in 2023 to $28,064 million in 2024, reflecting a significant growth in the segment's contribution. However, this growth coincided with a notable increase in credit risk exposure, as evidenced by the allowance for expected credit losses rising from $197 million in 2023 to $491 million in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by a customer bankruptcy recorded at Pratt & Whitney in the fourth quarter of 2024. This indicates that while Pratt & Whitney's financial contribution to RTX's consolidated sales grew substantially, it also brought heightened credit risk, particularly toward the end of 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) reported a loss from operations of $2,341 million, which decreased to $1,635 million in 2023 due to higher deliveries and lower abnormal production costs, including $1,753 million in 2022 and $1,527 million in 2023. However, by 2024, BCA's loss from operations surged to $7,969 million, driven by reach-forward losses of $4,079 million on the 777X and 767 programs, $443 million in 737-9 customer considerations from the January 2024 grounding, and production disruptions like the IAM 751 work stoppage. This shows that while higher deliveries initially improved financial performance between 2022 and 2023, the 2024 grounding and production issues significantly reversed this trend, leading to a dramatic increase in losses despite lower abnormal production costs of $1,271 million in 2024.",

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins.

This change reflects an improvement in credit risk management, as the company either recovered these receivables or tightened its credit policies to avoid carrying non-accrual receivables without an allowance in the Mining sector. The broader context shows that Caterpillar's total non-accrual receivables without an allowance across all segments also declined from $26 million in 2022 to $0 in 2023, suggesting a company-wide strategic shift in credit risk management.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT(2022) \u2192 Non-accrual Without an Allowance: In 2022, Caterpillar reported $1 million in non-accrual finance receivables without an allowance in the Mining segment.",
        "Hop 2: Non-accrual Without an Allowance \u2192 Mining: The Mining segment's non-accrual receivables without an allowance were a subset of the broader non-accrual category, indicating high-risk credit exposure in this key business area.",
        "Hop 3: Mining \u2190 CAT(2023): In 2023, Caterpillar reported $0 in non-accrual finance receivables without an allowance in the Mining segment, showing a complete elimination of this risk category."

      "answer": "In 2023, BGS experienced a $602 million increase in earnings from operations compared to 2022, primarily driven by higher commercial services revenue. This significant improvement in BGS's financial performance likely contributed to BA maintaining a portion of its equity method investments in the BGS segment. By 2024, BA's total equity method investments across all segments stood at $948 million, with BGS being a part of this allocation. The positive operational performance in 2023 appears to have supported continued strategic investment in BGS in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MMM reported an Employee-Related Expense of $370 million, which included $171 million allocated to the Corporate and Unallocated segment. By 2024, the total Employee-Related Expense dropped significantly to $136 million, with only $6 million attributed to Corporate and Unallocated. This sharp decline in allocated expense reflects a strategic shift or restructuring that lessened the burden of employee-related costs on the Corporate and Unallocated segment. Given that the total operating expense also dropped from $415 million in 2023 to $187 million in 2024, the reduced allocation to Corporate and Unallocated highlights a realignment of cost centers, likely improving the segment's relative financial position.",

      "question": "How did MMM's strong organic sales growth in 2022 translate into strategic positioning within the Safety and Industrial segment by 2024, particularly in light of the company's broader restructuring efforts?",
      "answer": "In 2022, MMM reported 9.0% organic sales growth, significantly driven by the Safety and Industrial segment's 7.8% organic growth. This foundational performance allowed MMM to strengthen its market position in core industrial safety products. By 2024, as MMM underwent major restructuring\u2014including the spin-off of its Health Care segment into Solventum\u2014the Safety and Industrial segment became a central pillar of MMM's streamlined portfolio. The company's focus on this segment is evident in its operational realignment, where Safety and Industrial was positioned as one of only three remaining business segments, reflecting MMM's strategic pivot toward its industrial core. The 2022 growth thus served as a catalyst for MMM's 2024 transformation, enabling a more focused investment strategy and resource allocation model centered around its strongest-performing segments.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the U.S. Domestic Package Segment saw volume increases driven by strong growth from SMBs, with double-digit revenue per piece growth and improved operating margins. This performance, underpinned by SMB demand, contributed to the segment\u2019s financial health and operational resilience. The segment's success stood in contrast to Supply Chain Solutions, which recorded $125 million in goodwill impairments in 2023. By 2024, the U.S. Domestic Package Segment remained stable with no goodwill impairments, reinforcing its role as a core, reliable business unit. This stability likely allowed UPS to focus strategic investments on higher-risk areas like Coyote\u2019s divestiture and the integration of MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns within Supply Chain Solutions.",

It also reflects the 2024 completion of purchase accounting allocations from our 2023 acquisitions of MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns, which are both reported within Supply Chain Solutions. In 2024, the decrease in goodwill balance is primarily due to the divestiture of our truckload brokerage business (\"Coyote\") within Supply Chain Solutions as discussed in note 8.\n\nThe remaining changes were due to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar on the translation of non-U.S. Dollar goodwill balances.\n\n## 2023 Goodwill Activity\n\nGoodwill acquired during 2023 was primarily associated with our acquisitions of MNX Global Logistics and Happy Returns, which are both reported within Supply Chain Solutions. It also reflects the 2023 completion of purchase accounting allocations from our 2022 acquisition of Bomi Group. During 2023, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $125 million, comprised of: $56 million related to our Roadie reporting unit, $61 million related to our Delivery Solutions reporting unit, which represented all the goodwill associated with that reporting unit, and an immaterial charge resulting from the closure of a trade management services business within Supply Chain Solutions.\n\nThe remaining changes were due to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar on the translation of non-U.S. Dollar goodwill balances.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment\n\nWe complete our annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1 on a reporting unit basis. The results concluded that the fair values of our reporting units were in excess of their respective carrying values. Approximately $1.1 billion of our consolidated goodwill balance of $4.3 billion is represented by our Global Freight Forwarding, Roadie and Global Logistics and Distribution reporting units which, based on our annual impairment evaluation, are exhibiting a limited excess of fair value above carrying value and reflect a greater risk of an impairment occurring in future periods.\n\nBased on our review of managerial realignments, which occurred as of October 1, 2024, we have determined that our MNX Global Logistics and Marken businesses are now within a single operating segment and, based on criteria in ASC Topic 350, also represent a single reporting unit. We performed impairment analyses as of October 1, 2024, reflective of our reporting unit structures before and after the reporting unit change, and did not identify any impairment of goodwill in connection therewith.\n\nWe did not record any goodwill impairment charges in the years ended December 31, 2024 or 2022. In 2023, we recorded non-cash goodwill impairment charges of $125 million, as described above.\n\nCumulatively, we have recorded $1.2 billion of goodwill impairment charges in Supply Chain Solutions, while our International and U.S. Domestic Package segments have not recorded any goodwill impairment charges.",

By 2023, BCA revenues grew further by $7,875 million, primarily driven by an even greater increase in 787 deliveries. This progression indicates that BCA's recovery was underway, with the 787 program serving as a key revenue driver as the company worked through its legal and operational setbacks. The growth in 787 deliveries thus reflects both improved production stability and demand recovery in the commercial aviation market.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BA(2022) \u2192 BCA: Boeing operated the BCA segment, which was impacted by legal settlements including a $2,510 million Deferred Prosecution Agreement.",

          "chunk_text": "based upon current  information,  that  the  outcome  of  any  such  legal  proceeding,  claim,  or  government  dispute  and investigation will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins. We operate in four reportable segments: BCA, BDS, BGS and BCC.\n\n118",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, CAT's Resource Industries segment reported $403 million in depreciation and amortization expenses, indicating significant capital investment in this division. This investment likely supported the segment's operations and product offerings, which contributed to favorable price realization\u2014a key profit driver mentioned in 2021 Q4 results. By 2024, favorable price realization had a $1.238 billion positive impact on consolidated operating profit, showing that pricing strategies initiated or strengthened during earlier years, including those tied to Resource Industries, matured into a major financial lever. This suggests a strategic shift or continuation where asset base investments in Resource Industries were leveraged to support pricing power across the company's portfolio.",

The  increase  was  primarily  due  to  higher  sales  volume,  driven  by higher  end-user  demand  for  equipment  and  aftermarket  parts,  and  favorable  price  realization.  End-user  demand  was  higher  in mining as well as heavy construction and quarry and aggregates.\n\nResource Industries' profit was $305 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, an increase of $32 million, or 12 percent, compared with $273 million in the fourth quarter of 2020. Increased manufacturing costs and SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were more than offset by higher sales volume and favorable price realization. Unfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and material costs.\n\nThe increase in SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses was driven by investments aligned with growth initiatives, primarily labor, and higher shortterm incentive compensation expense.\n\nResource Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 11.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021, compared with 12.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## Energy &amp; Transportation\n\n",

The profit impact of lower sales volume of $1.298 billion, higher selling, general and administrative (SG &amp;A) and research and development (R&amp;D) expenses of $201 million, and higher restructuring costs of $165 million were more than offset by favorable price realization of $1.238 billion, the absence of the impact of the divestiture of the company's Longwall business in 2023 of $586 million and favorable manufacturing costs of $246 million. The increase in SG &amp;A/R&amp;D expenses was primarily driven by investments aligned with strategic initiatives. Favorable manufacturing costs largely reflected lower freight.\n\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, restructuring costs increased primarily due to the divestitures of certain non-U.S. entities.\n\nOperating profit margin was 20.2 percent in 2024, compared with 19.3 percent in 2023.\n\n",

By 2024, its contribution dropped to $461 million, reflecting a $95 million decrease. This decline was a significant component of the overall reduction in the consolidated total capital expenditures, which fell by $998 million (16%) from $6,174 million in 2023 to $5,176 million in 2024.

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing's BCA segment saw a $7,875 million revenue increase driven by higher 787 deliveries, which masked underlying production inefficiencies such as $1,527 million in abnormal production costs. By 2024, these inefficiencies, combined with new disruptions like the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement, led to a significant $6,334 million increase in BCA's loss from operations, including $4,079 million in reach-forward losses on the 777X and 767 programs and $443 million in 737-9 customer considerations. This evolution shows how the earlier revenue growth in BCA did not translate into improved margins due to persistent and new production challenges that directly drove lower margins in 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Cat Financial considered a finance receivable past due when any installment was over 30 days past due, which directly influenced its credit risk evaluation and monitoring. This same methodology was maintained in 2023, indicating consistency in credit quality assessment. However, in 2023, Caterpillar highlighted its increased reliance on Cat Financial through a support agreement that required Caterpillar to remain the sole owner and potentially make payments if Cat Financial failed to maintain certain financial ratios. Additionally, Caterpillar reported that its Financial Products segment would rely on Cat Financial's credit facilities, which totaled $4.16 billion as of December 31, 2023. Therefore, while the past-due monitoring criteria remained stable, Caterpillar's financial risk exposure through its relationship with Cat Financial increased due to the expanded reliance on Cat Financial's credit facilities and the binding support agreement.",

This indicates that other subcategories within the Safety and Industrial segment, such as roofing granules and industrial adhesives and tapes, had to offset the drop in Abrasives sales to maintain flat overall segment growth.

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Raytheon contributed $26.452 billion to RTX\u2019s Consolidated Net Sales. By 2024, this figure slightly decreased to $26.220 billion, indicating a marginal decline in Raytheon\u2019s sales contribution. This slight drop aligns with the reported decrease in development program spending at Raytheon in 2024, which contrasts with increased R&D spending at Collins and Pratt & Whitney. The reduction in Raytheon\u2019s development spending suggests a strategic shift or budget reallocation, which may have impacted its sales performance within RTX\u2019s broader portfolio.",

This recovery suggests that as the commercial aerospace industry rebounded, Pratt & Whitney's performance improved, directly contributing to RTX's overall sales figures.

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses.

The reduction suggests a focused effort to streamline overhead costs and improve overall financial efficiency.",

In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China/Hong Kong total sales increased 8 percent which included increased organic sales of 8 percent.\n- For 2023, in the Americas geographic area, U.S. total sales were flat which included flat organic sales. In the Asia Pacific geographic area, China/Hong Kong total sales decreased 17 percent which included decreased organic sales of 13 percent.\n\nAs discussed in the risk factors provided in Item 1A, the Company's results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic, political, regulatory, international trade, geopolitical, and other ex ternal conditions.\n\nManaging currency risks: 3M utilizes a number of tools to manage the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates including natural hedges such as pricing, productivity, hard currency, hard currency-indexed billings, and localizing source of supply. 3M also uses certain derivative instruments (with a tenor up to five years) and non-derivative instruments to mitigate currency risk. As described in Note 17, these include instruments designated as cash flow hedges, net investment hedges or not designated in formal hedge relationships.\n\n3M's hedging approach is designed to mitigate a portion of foreign currency risk and reduce volatility, ultimately allowing time for 3M's businesses to respond to changes in the marketplace.\n\nFinancial condition: Refer to the section entitled Financial Condition and Liquidity later in MD&amp;A for a discussion of items impacting cash flows.\n\nIn February 2025, 3M's Board of Directors replaced the Company's November 2018 repurchase program with a new repurchase program. This new program authorizes the repurchase of up to $7.5 billion of 3M's outstanding common stock, with no pre-established end date. In 2024, the Company purchased $1,801 million of its own stock, compared to $33 million of stock purchases in 2023. In February 2024, 3M's Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2024 dividend of $1.51 per share. In May 2024, 3M's Board of Directors declared a second-quarter 2024 dividend of $0.70 per share resetting 3M's dividend post-Solventum spin. In August and November 2024, 3M's Board of Directors declared a third-quarter and fourth-quarter 2024 dividend respectively of $0.70 per share. In February 2025, 3M's Board of Directors declared a first-quarter 2025 dividend of $0.73 per share, an increase of 4 percent.\n\nRaw materials: Refer to the section entitled Raw materials in Item 1 for discussion of 3M's sources and availability of raw materials in 2024.",

      "question": "How did the flat performance in MMM's Automotive Aftermarket sales between 2022 and 2024 influence the overall stability of the Safety and Industrial segment's organic growth and operating margin trajectory?",
      "answer": "MMM's Automotive Aftermarket sales remained flat year-on-year in 2024 after reporting $1,241 million in 2022. This stability contributed to the Safety and Industrial segment's flat overall sales performance on an organic basis, despite growth in areas like roofing granules and industrial adhesives. The broader industrial market caution, particularly in the EMEA region, limited stronger growth potential. However, the segment's operating income margins increased year-on-year, driven by productivity gains and spending discipline, despite the lack of growth in the automotive aftermarket. This suggests that while the Automotive Aftermarket did not detract from segment performance, it also did not contribute to margin expansion.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

By 2024, inter-segment sales for Raytheon had decreased to $143 million, while total business segment sales for Raytheon increased to $26,713 million. This indicates a significant reduction in internal sales dependency for Raytheon despite a substantial increase in overall segment sales, suggesting a strategic shift in how the segment operates and generates external revenue.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM reported a total sales change of 9.9%, with strong organic growth across all regions. By 2023, MMM's total sales change dropped significantly to -4.5%, as shown in the 2023 disclosures. The Transportation and Electronics segment specifically contributed to this decline, with its organic sales decreasing by 3.5% in 2023, while acquisitions added 0.7% and divestitures subtracted 0.7%. This represents a dramatic reversal from 2022, where MMM experienced robust global growth, including 8.8% organic sales globally. The shift indicates a contraction in market demand or strategic challenges in the Transportation and Electronics segment.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Resource Industries' profitability was directly impacted by rising short-term incentive compensation expenses, which contributed to increased SG&A/R&D costs. Specifically, the fourth quarter 2021 report (filed in 2022) noted that higher short-term incentive compensation was a key factor driving SG&A/R&D expense growth. This pressure was evident in the segment's profit margin decline from 12.5% in Q4 2020 to 11.0% in Q4 2021. However, in 2023, Caterpillar's capital expenditures for Resource Industries rose to $245 million, up from $237 million in 2022, signaling continued strategic investment in the segment despite the rising cost environment. This suggests Caterpillar maintained confidence in the long-term outlook for Resource Industries even as near-term profitability was challenged by expense increases like short-term incentive compensation.",

The decrease was due to lower average debt outstanding during 2021, compared with 2020.\n- Other income/expense in 2021 was income of $1.814 billion, compared with expense of $44 million in 2020. The change was primarily due to mark-to-market gains for remeasurement of pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans in 2021, compared with mark-to-market losses in 2020. Favorable impacts from foreign currency exchange gains (losses) and lower pension and OPEB plan costs also contributed to the change.\n\nThe company experienced foreign currency exchange net losses in 2020, compared with net gains in 2021.\n\n- The provision for income taxes for 2021 reflected an annual effective tax rate of 22.9 percent compared with 27.8 percent for 2020, excluding the discrete items discussed in the following paragraph. The decrease from 2020 was primarily related to changes in the geographic mix of profits from a tax perspective.\n\nThe provision for income taxes for 2021 also included the following:\n\n- A  tax  charge  of  $190  million  related  to  $833  million  of  pension  and  OPEB  mark-to-market  gains  in  2021, compared to a $82 million tax benefit related to $383 million of mark-to-market losses in 2020.\n- A tax benefit of $36 million to reflect changes in estimates related to prior year's U.S. taxes in 2021 compared to $80 million in 2020.\n- A  tax  benefit  of  $63  million  in  2021,  compared  with  $49  million  in  2020,  for  the  settlement  of  stock-based compensation awards with associated tax deductions in excess of cumulative U.S. GAAP compensation expense.\n- A tax benefit of $38 million in 2021 to recognize U.S. capital losses.\n\n## Construction Industries\n\nConstruction  Industries'  total  sales  were  $22.106  billion  in  2021,  an  increase  of  $5.188  billion,  or  31  percent,  compared  with $16.918 billion in 2020. The increase was due to higher sales volume, favorable price realization and favorable currency impacts related to the Chinese yuan, euro and Australian dollar. The increase in sales volume was driven by higher end-user demand for equipment and aftermarket parts and the impact from changes in dealer inventories. Dealers decreased inventories during 2020, compared with dealer inventories that were about flat during 2021.\n\n- In  North America,  sales  increased  due  to  higher  end-user  demand,  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories  and favorable price realization. Dealers decreased inventories more in 2020 than in 2021.\n- Sales increased in Latin America primarily due to the impact from changes in dealer inventories, higher end-user demand and favorable price realization. Dealers increased inventories during 2021, compared with a decrease in 2020.\n- In EAME, sales increased due to higher end-user demand, the impact from changes in dealer inventories and favorable currency impacts from a stronger euro and British pound. Dealers increased inventories during 2021, compared with a decrease in 2020.\n- Sales  increased  in  Asia/Pacific  due  to  the  impact  from  changes  in  dealer  inventories  and  favorable  currency  impacts related  to  the  Chinese  yuan  and Australian  dollar.  Dealers  decreased  inventories  during  2020,  compared  with  a  slight increase in 2021.\n\nConstruction  Industries'  profit  was  $3.706  billion  in  2021,  an  increase  of  $1.333  billion,  or  56  percent,  compared  with  $2.373 billion in 2020. The increase was mainly due to higher sales volume and favorable price realization, partially offset by unfavorable manufacturing costs and higher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses.\n\nUnfavorable manufacturing costs reflected higher material costs, increased variable labor and burden, primarily freight, and higher period manufacturing costs. The increase in period manufacturing costs was driven by higher short-term incentive compensation expense and higher labor costs.\n\nHigher SG&amp;A/R&amp;D expenses were driven primarily by higher short-term incentive compensation expense.\n\nConstruction Industries' profit as a percent of total sales was 16.8 percent in 2021, compared with 14.0 percent in 2020.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar recognized a $925 million goodwill impairment in its Rail reporting unit, signaling a significant decline in the unit's expected future cash flows driven by reduced demand forecasts and inflationary cost pressures. The Rail reporting unit is part of the Energy & Transportation segment, which had previously expanded through the 2021 acquisition of SPM Oil & Gas for $359 million, a strategic move aimed at broadening its offerings in the well service industry. By 2024, the absence of any goodwill impairments indicated stabilization, suggesting Caterpillar may have shifted strategic emphasis within the Energy & Transportation segment toward leveraging the SPM Oil & Gas acquisition to drive growth and offset Rail's underperformance.

Headquartered near Fort Worth, Texas, SPM Oil &amp; Gas produces a full line of pumps, flow iron, consumable parts, wellhead and pressure control products that are offered via an extensive global network of service centers. This acquisition, included in the Energy &amp; Transportation segment, is consistent with our strategy of providing our  customers  expanded  offerings  and  services  which  will  now  be  one  of  the  broadest  in  the  well  service  industry.  The purchase price, net of $22 million of acquired cash, was approximately $359 million.\n\nWe financed the transaction with available cash. Tangible assets as of the acquisition date were $520 million, recorded at their fair values, and primarily included cash of $22 million, receivables of $106 million, inventories of $159 million, leased assets of  $105  million,  and  property,  plant,  and  equipment  of  $117  million.  Finite-lived  intangible  assets  acquired  of  $23  million included  developed  technology  and  trade  names  and  will  be  amortized  on  a  straight-line  basis  over  a  weighted-average amortization period of approximately 8 years. Liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date were $192 million, recorded at their  fair  values,  and  primarily  included  lease  liabilities  of  $105  million  and  accounts  payable  of  $33  million.  Goodwill  of $30 million represented the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets acquired. Assuming this transaction had been made at the beginning of any period presented, the consolidated pro forma results would not be materially different from reported results.\n\n## 25. Restructuring costs\n\nOur accounting for employee separations is dependent upon how the particular program is designed. For voluntary programs, we recognize eligible separation costs at the time of employee acceptance unless the acceptance requires explicit approval by the company. For involuntary programs, we recognize eligible costs when management has approved the program, the affected employees have been properly notified and the costs are estimable.\n\nRestructuring costs for 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did the shift in GE's tax benefit from discontinued operations in 2022 impact the financial performance of GEHealthCare in 2024, particularly in relation to GE's strategic investment gains in the segment?",
      "answer": "In 2022, GE reported a tax benefit of $344 million related to discontinued operations within its 'Other' category, which included healthcare assets. By 2024, GEHealthCare emerged as a distinct segment with a $5 million tax provision directly tied to its earnings from discontinued operations. This transition aligns with GE's strategic pivot, where the company restructured its healthcare division, leading to a significant investment gain of $480 million in 2024. The evolution from a general tax benefit in 2022 to a targeted tax impact and investment return in 2024 reflects the financial maturation of GEHealthCare within the corporate portfolio.",

        "Hop 1: GE(2022) \u2192 Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes: GE reported a $344 million tax benefit in the 'Other' category for discontinued operations, which included healthcare assets.",
        "Hop 2: Benefit (Provision) for Income Taxes \u2192 GEHealthCare: By 2024, GEHealthCare was a standalone segment with a $5 million tax provision directly tied to its operations and earnings from discontinued activities.",
        "Hop 3: GEHealthCare \u2190 GE(2024): GE realized a $480 million investment gain from its stake in GEHealthCare in 2024, indicating a strategic financial realignment from the 2022 tax positioning."

The consolidated financial statements of GE A erospace are prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GA A P). Unless otherwise noted, tables are presented in U.S. dollars in millions. Certain columns and rows within tables may not add due to the use of rounded numbers. Percentages presented in this report are calculated from the underlying numbers in millions. Discussions throughout this M D&amp;A  are based on continuing operations unless otherwise noted. The M D&amp;A should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements and Notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n\nIn the accompanying analysis of financial information, we sometimes use information derived from consolidated financial data but not presented in our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of these data are considered 'non-GAAP financial measures' under SEC rules. See the Non-GAAP Financial M easures section for the reasons we use these non-GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to their most directly comparable GA A P financial measures.\n\nBUSINESS OVERVIEW AND ENVIRONMENT. As a global aerospace company, our worldwide operations can be affected by industrial, economic, and political factors on both a regional and global level. Demand for our equipment and services is demonstrated by our backlog of engine orders and services and growth in our installed base, and tends to follow commercial air travel and freight demand and government funding for defense budgets. We also expect a significant ramp in our delivery of engine units and services for newer product platforms in the years ahead to meet this demand. Refer to the Segment Operations sections for Commercial Engines &amp; Services and Defense &amp; Propulsion Technologies below for additional detail about these dynamics for our commercial and defense businesses, respectively.\n\nGlobal material availability and supplier delivery performance continue to cause disruptions and have impacted our production and delivery of equipment and services to our customers. We are investing in our manufacturing facilities, overhaul facilities and our supply chain to increase production and strengthen yield in order to improve delivery to our customers. We continue to partner with our suppliers to improve material input, and work with our customers to calibrate future production rates. We are leveraging FLIGHT DECK and partnering with suppliers to improve material input and proactively manage the impact of inflationary pressure by driving cost productivity and adjusting the pricing of our products and services. We expect the impact of supply chain constraints and inflation will continue, and we are continuing to take action to mitigate the impacts.\n\nGiven the significant business we have with airframers and many airlines, challenges affecting the commercial aviation industry or key participants can adversely impact the demand for our products and services, the timing of orders, deliveries and related payments and other factors. We are monitoring the production and other challenges at The Boeing Company, and we continue to align with them on production expectations and assess potential impacts to our business. The Boeing worker's strike, resolved in the fourth quarter of 2024, had no significant impact to our revenue, earnings and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2024.\n\n## CONSOLIDATED RESULTS\n\n",

      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing faced significant challenges with 787 aircraft deliveries, including delivery delays and rework, which led to ASC 606 adjustments and potential reductions in backlog. By 2024, BCA revenues had decreased by $11,040 million year-over-year, primarily due to lower deliveries across all programs, including the 787. Despite this decline, Boeing continued to invest in the BCA segment, with an investment balance of $391 million in 2024, showing a slight increase from $384 million in 2023. This suggests that while the 787 delivery issues continued to negatively affect BCA's financial performance in 2024, Boeing maintained its strategic investment in the segment, likely to stabilize and grow commercial aircraft operations in the long term.",

The  increase  in  contractual  backlog  during  2021  was  primarily  due  to  new  orders, reclassifications  from  unobligated  backlog  related  to  BDS  and  BGS  contracts,  increases  in  price  escalation  and reductions  in  the  number  of  existing  orders  that  in  our  assessment  do  not  meet  the  accounting  requirements  of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606 for inclusion in backlog, partially offset by deliveries and cancellations. During  2021,  we  have  had  higher  ASC  606  adjustments  of  787  orders  as  a  result  of  delivery  delays  related  to inspections and rework. If 787 aircraft deliveries continue to be paused, we remain unable to deliver 737 MAX aircraft in China for an extended period of time, and/or entry into service of the 777X, 737 MAX 7 and/or 737 MAX 10 is further delayed,  we  may  experience  additional  reductions  to  backlog  and/or  significant  order  cancellations. Additionally,  we may  continue  to  experience  fewer  new  orders  and  increased  cancellations  across  all  of  our  commercial  airplane programs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and associated impacts on demand.\n\nUnobligated  backlog  includes  U.S.  and  non-U.S.  government  definitive  contracts  for  which  funding  has  not  been authorized. The decrease in unobligated backlog in 2021 was primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to BDS and BGS contracts, partially offset by contract awards.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nGlobal Trade We continually monitor the global trade environment in response to geopolitical economic developments, as well as changes in tariffs, trade agreements or sanctions that may impact the company.\n\nThe global economy continues to experience significant adverse impacts due to the COVID-19 pandemic, including a decline in overall trade in general and in aerospace in particular. There is a great deal of uncertainty regarding the duration, scale and localization of these impacts to the global economy and governments are enacting a wide range of responses  to  mitigate  the  unfolding  economic  impacts.  We  are  closely  monitoring  the  current  impact  and  potential future economic consequences of COVID-19 to the global economy, the aerospace sector and our Company.

This growth was primarily driven by commercial aerospace and other commercial sales, which reached $11,133 million in 2023. However, this growth occurred alongside significant operational challenges tied to Pratt & Whitney's Geared Turbofan engine family, particularly the PW1100G-JM model. In July 2023, a rare condition in powder metal used for engine parts required accelerated inspections, resulting in increased engine removals, shop visits, and aircraft on ground levels. These operational issues introduced risks such as potential delays, increased costs, and liabilities, which could negatively impact the company's ability to meet customer requirements and maintain profitability.",

      "question": "How did Caterpillar's Financial Products segment's derivative exposure in 2022 relate to the stability of trade and other receivables on the balance sheet by 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Caterpillar's Financial Products segment showed significant derivative exposure tied to 'Receivables - Trade and Other,' with a fair value of $109 million in 2021 and $21 million in 2020 under undesignated foreign exchange contracts. This suggests active hedging of trade receivables, particularly against currency risk. By 2024, Caterpillar reported $9,282 million in 'Receivables - Trade and Other' on its balance sheet, a relatively stable position compared to $9,310 million in 2023. The derivative activities in 2022 may have contributed to mitigating currency volatility, helping to maintain a consistent level of trade receivables over the two-year period. However, the exact causal relationship between the derivative strategies and receivables stability is an interpretation based on the presence of these instruments in the financial disclosures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CAT(2022) \u2192 Financial Products: The Financial Products segment had derivative exposure related to trade receivables, with $109 million and $21 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, under undesignated foreign exchange contracts.",
        "Hop 2: Financial Products \u2192 Receivables - Trade and Other: Derivatives were used to hedge against currency risks associated with trade receivables, indicating a strategic link between the Financial Products segment and the management of trade receivables.",
        "Hop 3: Receivables - Trade and Other \u2190 CAT(2024): By 2024, 'Receivables - Trade and Other' stood at $9,282 million, showing relative stability compared to $9,310 million in 2023, suggesting that earlier hedging strategies may have contributed to this consistency."

      "question": "How did the evolution of UPS's Transformation Strategy Costs from 2022 to 2024 reflect a shift in the company's transformation focus, particularly in relation to the increase in Total Transformation Strategy Costs from $380 million in 2022 to $322 million in 2024 despite the discontinuation of Transformation 1.0?",
      "answer": "In 2022, UPS reported Total Transformation Strategy Costs of $380 million, primarily driven by legacy Transformation 1.0 initiatives such as Compensation ($30 million), Benefits ($176 million), and Other expenses ($171 million). By 2024, the company had discontinued Transformation 1.0 entirely (showing $0 for that category), shifting focus to Transformation 2.0 and Fit to Serve initiatives, which accounted for $83 million and $204 million respectively. This led to a reconfiguration of the cost structure, where the earlier emphasis on compensation and benefits was replaced by investments in business portfolio reviews, financial systems, and network reconfiguration. Despite a nominal decrease in total costs from $380 million (2022) to $322 million (2024), the composition of these costs reflects a strategic pivot from internal restructuring to broader operational transformation.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(2022) \u2192 Transformation Costs: In 2022, UPS disclosed Transformation Strategy Costs totaling $380 million, with significant portions allocated to Compensation ($30M), Benefits ($176M), and Other expenses ($171M).",
        "Hop 2: Transformation Costs \u2192 Total Transformation Strategy Costs: The 2022 data shows that these individual costs aggregated into the Total Transformation Strategy Costs, which was $380 million, reflecting the company's focus on internal restructuring.",

      "question": "How did Emerson's (EMR) commodity-related earnings impact evolve from 2022 to 2023, considering its relationship with total gains and losses, and what does this reveal about their exposure to commodity price volatility?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Emerson reported a $12 million gain to earnings from commodity-related activities, which was part of a total $89 million gain to earnings from all categories (including foreign currency and net investment hedge). By 2023, this shifted to a $19 million loss to earnings from commodity activities, contributing to a total $69 million loss to earnings. This indicates a significant reversal in commodity performance, moving from a positive impact to a negative one, highlighting increased exposure and sensitivity to commodity price volatility over this period. The relationship between commodity gains/losses and total gains/losses shows that commodity swings were a major driver of earnings volatility.",

In the first quarter of fiscal 2022, the equity holders' cumulative cash return exceeded the threshold and as a result, the Company received a distribution of $438 in November 2021 (in total, a pretax gain of $453 was recognized in the first quarter). Based on the terms of the agreement and the current calculation, the Company could receive additional distributions of approximately $75 which are expected to be received over the next two-to-three years. However, the distributions are contingent on the timing and price at which Vertiv shares are sold by the equity holders and therefore, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of the remaining distributions to the Company.\n\nOn May 31, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its Therm-O-Disc sensing and protection technologies business to an affiliate of One Rock Capital Partners, LLC. The Company recognized a pretax gain of $486 ($429 after-tax, $0.72 per share). See Note 4.\n\n## OTHER DEDUCTIONS, NET\n\nOther deductions, net were $601 in 2022, an increase of $283 compared with 2021, reflecting a charge of $145 related to the Company exiting its business in Russia ($10 of which is reported in restructuring costs), acquisition/divestiture costs of $110, higher intangibles amortization of $57, primarily related to the Heritage AspenTech acquisition, and a mark-to-market loss of $50 related to foreign currency forward contracts entered into by AspenTech to mitigate the impact of foreign currency exchange associated with the Micromine purchase price. These items were partially offset by lower restructuring costs of $64, gains from the sales of capital assets of $15, and a $14 gain from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment. The prior year also had several investment-related gains which are described below. See Notes 5 and 6.\n\nOther deductions, net were $318 in 2021, a decrease of $214 compared with 2020, reflecting lower restructuring costs of $134, investment-related gains, including gains of $21 from an investment sale and $17 from the acquisition of full ownership of an equity investment, and a gain of $31 from the sale of an equity investment, a favorable impact from pensions, and favorable foreign currency transactions of $17. These items were partially offset by higher intangibles amortization of $61, primarily related to the OSI acquisition.\n\n## INTEREST EXPENSE, NET\n\nInterest expense, net was $193, $154 and $156 in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2022 reflects the issuance of $3 billion of long-term debt in December 2021 to support the AspenTech transaction, partially offset by $500 of notes that matured in the first quarter of fiscal 2022.\n\n## EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES\n\nPretax earnings of $4,085 increased $1,173 in 2022, up 40 percent compared with 2021 reflecting the impact of the Vertiv and Therm-O-Disc gains discussed above. Earnings increased $401 in Automation Solutions, $19 in AspenTech and $76 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $223, largely due to the Russia business exit loss and acquisition/divestiture costs, offset by lower stock compensation expense of $80. See the Business Segments discussion that follows and Note 18.\n\nPretax earnings of $2,912 increased $577 in 2021, up 25 percent compared with 2020. Earnings increased $416 in Automation Solutions, $9 in AspenTech and $246 in Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions. Costs reported at Corporate increased $96, reflecting higher stock compensation expense of $114 and first year acquisition accounting charges and fees related to the OSI acquisition of $50, partially offset by the investment-related gains discussed above and lower unallocated pension and postretirement costs which decreased by $41.\n\n## INCOME TAXES\n\nIncome taxes were $855, $585 and $345 for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, resulting in effective tax rates of 21 percent, 20 percent and 15 percent in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nThe tax rates for 2022, 2021 and 2020 include benefits from restructuring subsidiaries of $11, $13 and $103, respectively. The impact on the 2022 tax rate from the gain on divestiture of the Therm-O-Disc business and the Russia business exit in 2022 essentially offset. The lower rate in 2020 included the impact of a research and development tax credit study. See Note 14.",

Emerson will receive upfront, pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $9.5 billion and a note of $2.25 billion at close (which will accrue 5 percent interest payable in kind by capitalizing interest), while retaining a 45 percent non-controlling common equity ownership interest in a new standalone joint venture between Emerson and Blackstone. The Climate Technologies business, which includes the Copeland compressor business and the entire portfolio of products and services across all residential and commercial HVAC and refrigeration end-markets, had fiscal 2022 net sales of approximately $5.0 billion and pretax earnings of $1.0 billion. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of calendar year 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.\n\nOn October 31, 2022, the Company completed the divestiture of its InSinkErator business, which manufactures food waste disposers, to Whirlpool Corporation for $3.0 billion. This business had net sales of $630 and pretax earnings of $152 for fiscal 2022 and is reported in the Tools &amp; Home Products segment. The agreement was announced in August 2022 and the assets and liabilities of InSinkErator were classified as held-for-sale as of September 30, 2022 and are included in other current assets, other assets, accrued expenses and other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet.",

      "question": "How did Boeing's long-term contract estimation risks in 2022, which contributed to operational losses, evolve into 2023 given the improvements in BCA's 787 deliveries and reduced program losses?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Boeing highlighted significant estimation risks in long-term contracts, particularly on the KC-46A Tanker, VC-25B, and Commercial Crew programs, which contributed to a $3,460 million reach-forward loss on the 787 program. These risks stemmed from the complex nature of long-term contracts with the U.S. government and the sensitivity of profit estimates to cost assumptions. In 2023, BCA saw a turnaround with a $7,875 million revenue increase driven by higher 787 deliveries, suggesting that the prior-year losses on the 787 program were mitigated. This indicates that either estimation accuracy improved, production efficiencies were realized, or contractual adjustments were made to reduce the impact of prior losses, showing a temporal evolution from risk exposure to operational recovery within the same business segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: BA(2022) \u2192 Loss from Operations: Boeing reported a $3,460 million reach-forward loss on the 787 program in 2022 due to long-term contract estimation risks on programs like KC-46A, VC-25B, and Commercial Crew.",
        "Hop 2: Loss from Operations \u2192 BCA: The BCA segment experienced reduced losses in 2021 compared to 2020 due to the absence of a $6,493 million reach-forward loss on the 777X program and lower period expenses, despite the 2021 $3,460 million 787 loss.",
        "Hop 3: BCA \u2190 BA(2023): In 2023, BCA revenues increased by $7,875 million, primarily driven by higher 787 deliveries, indicating a recovery from the prior-year losses on the same platform."

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Policies &amp; Estimates\n\n## Accounting for Long-term Contracts\n\nSubstantially  all  contracts  at  BDS  and  certain  contracts  at  BGS  are  long-term  contracts.  Our  long-term  contracts typically represent a single distinct performance obligation due to the highly interdependent and interrelated nature of the underlying goods and/or services and the significant service of integration that we provide.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales, costs, and profit for each performance obligation. Cost of sales is recognized as incurred, and revenue is determined by adding a proportionate amount of the estimated profit to the amount reported as cost of sales.\n\nDue to the size, duration and nature of many of our long-term contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. Total sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). The majority of these long-term contracts are with the U.S. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. Federal Acquisition Regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. Total cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence these  estimates  include  inflationary trends,  technical  and  schedule  risk,  internal  and  subcontractor performance  trends,  business  volume  assumptions,  COVID-19  disruptions,  asset  utilization  and  anticipated  labor agreements.\n\nRevenue and cost estimates for all significant long-term contract performance obligations are reviewed and reassessed quarterly.  Changes  in  these  estimates  could  result  in  recognition  of  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  to  the performance obligation's inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit in the period in which such changes are made. Changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reachforward loss which would be recorded immediately in earnings. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments across all long-term contracts increased loss from operations by  $880  million,  $942  million  and  $111  million,  respectively.  The  cumulative  catch-up  adjustments  in  2021  were primarily  due  to  losses  recognized  on  the  KC-46A  Tanker,  VC-25B  and  Commercial  Crew  programs.  These  are  all fixed-price development programs, and there is ongoing risk that similar losses may have to be recognized in future periods on these and/or other programs.\n\nDue  to  the  significance  of  judgment  in  the  estimation  process  described  above,  it  is  likely  that  materially  different earnings  could  be  recorded  if  we  used  different  assumptions  or  if  the  underlying  circumstances  were  to  change. Changes  in  underlying  assumptions/estimates,  supplier  performance,  or  circumstances  may  adversely  or  positively affect financial performance in future periods. If the combined gross margins for our profitable long-term contracts had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1% during 2021, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $300 million.\n\n## Program Accounting\n\nProgram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate revenues, costs and gross profit margin for the defined program accounting quantity. A program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a  product  to  be  produced  in  a  continuing,  long-term  production  effort  for  delivery  under  existing  and  anticipated contracts.  The  determination  of  the  accounting  quantity  is  limited  by  the  ability  to  make  reasonably  dependable estimates.",

      "question": "How did the $7,875 million revenue increase at Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) in 2023 correlate with the 11% decline in 787 deliveries from 73 in 2023 to 51 in 2024, and what does this suggest about the unit economics or pricing dynamics of the 787 program?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing Commercial Airplanes (BCA) reported a $7,875 million revenue increase, primarily attributed to higher 787 deliveries. However, in 2024, 787 deliveries dropped by 11% (from 73 to 51 units), even as total deliveries across all models declined to 348 from 528. This divergence suggests that the revenue growth in 2023 was strongly tied to the 787 program, yet the drop in 2024 deliveries did not proportionally impact overall revenue to the same degree. This could indicate either improved unit economics (e.g., higher margins per aircraft) or pricing adjustments that offset lower delivery volumes, implying potential strategic shifts in the 787 program's financial model.",

These costs were part of broader abnormal production expenses that strained BCA's performance. By 2024, Boeing's investment in BCA (as part of its equity method investments) had slightly decreased from $384 million in 2023 to $391 million in 2024, indicating a cautious reinvestment strategy following earlier financial pressures. The persistence of these investments, despite earlier losses tied to the 737NG and MAX programs, suggests a strategic decision to stabilize and rebuild the commercial aircraft segment.",

The 2021 loss includes a reach-forward loss on the 787 program of $3,460 million, abnormal production costs related to 737 MAX of $1,887 million, and abnormal production costs related to the 787 program of $468 million resulting from continued production issues, inspections and rework, partially offset by higher 737 MAX deliveries. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million and additional drivers as noted in the paragraph below.\n\nBCA loss from operations was $13,847 million in 2020 compared with $6,657 million in 2019. The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,  $2,567  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  related  to  737  MAX,  $623  million  of  severance  cost,  $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  in  the  first  half  of  2020  from  the  temporary  suspension  of  operations  in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction  in  the  accounting  quantity  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  also  contributed  to  lower  earnings.  The  2019  loss primarily reflects the absence of 737 MAX deliveries in the second, third and fourth quarters of 2019 and charges of $8,259 million for estimated 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nLower commercial airplane deliveries and the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a significant adverse impact on future earnings and margins until deliveries ramp up and return to historical levels.\n\n## Backlog\n\nOur  total  backlog  represents  the  estimated  transaction  prices  on  unsatisfied  and  partially  satisfied  performance obligations to our customers where we believe it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform.

      "question": "How did the funded status of GE's Other Pension Plans subject to regulatory funding requirements change from 2023 to 2024, and what does this shift indicate about the company's pension liability management?",
      "answer": "In 2023, GE's Other Pension Plans subject to regulatory funding had a deficit of $688 million, with benefit obligations totaling $3,225 million and assets valued at $3,913 million. By 2024, the benefit obligation decreased to $2,736 million, while asset values declined slightly to $3,592 million, resulting in a larger deficit of $856 million. This indicates that although the company reduced its pension liability, the funded status worsened year-over-year, suggesting either underperformance of pension assets or a strategic shift in managing these obligations.",

Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $16.76, $15.77 and $21.20, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESPP options of $12 million, $21 million, and $31 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## NOTE 22. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its continuing operations in three business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; and Consumer. 3M's three business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. On April 1, 2024, 3M completed the previously announced separation of its Health Care business as a separate public company, Solventum (see Note 2 for additional information). 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income (loss) as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income (loss) and income before taxes. Business segment operating income (loss) excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated and Other'). Business segment disclosures consider information used by/provided to 3M's chief operating decision maker (CODM). For 3M, the CODM is the chief executive officer. The CODM uses business segment operating income (loss) to allocate resources to segments in the planning and forecasting process along with periodic ongoing reviews of results and overall market activity.\n\n3M made certain changes to the composition of segment information reviewed by 3M's CODM effective in the second quarter of 2024 largely as a result of the separation of Solventum and changes within its business segments effective in the first quarter of 2024. Accordingly, information provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all applicable periods presented.\n\nEffective in the second quarter of 2024, this change included the following:\n\nElimination of former Health Care business segment\n\n- The former Health Care business segment was eliminated in the second quarter of 2024 in connection with the separation of Solventum and reflection of its historical net income and applicable assets and liabilities included in the Separation as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements.\n\nAddition of 'Other' and update to 'Corporate and Unallocated'\n\n- 3M added the 'Other' category of information as a result of the Separation. It principally reflects:\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Activity included in 3M's existing 'Corporate and Unallocated' was updated primarily to additionally reflect:\n- Removal of costs related to separating and divesting Solventum that were eligible to be part of discontinued operations.\n- Commercial activity with Solventum post-Separation and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations other than those beginning in the first quarter of 2024 included in 'Other' associated with transition arrangement activity for which 3M began to charge fees in April 2024.",

By 2024, this deficit had decreased to $5,548 million, indicating a notable improvement in the funding status of the company's pension plans. This change suggests that GE implemented strategies to either increase the fair value of plan assets or reduce benefit obligations over this period. Specifically, while the total benefit obligation decreased from $98,863 million in 2022 to $28,166 million in 2024, the fair value of assets increased from $83,522 million to $22,618 million, contributing to the reduced deficit.

      "answer": "From 2022 to 2024, Missiles and Fire Control's intersegment sales increased from $627 million to $804 million, a rise of $177 million. This significant growth in internal sales raises questions about how LMT evaluates the actual profitability of the segment, as intersegment sales and related profits are excluded from segment operating profit under consolidated financial reporting. In 2024, the company reiterated that intersegment sales are eliminated in consolidation and not included in management's evaluation of segment performance. Therefore, while the segment may appear to be growing in terms of total sales, the exclusion of internal transactions could mask the true margin contribution and operational efficiency of Missiles and Fire Control, requiring deeper internal analysis to ensure accurate performance tracking.",

        "Hop 2: Missiles and Fire Control \u2192 Intersegment Sales: Intersegment sales grew to $804M in 2024, showing increased internal collaboration and potential complexity in segment financials.",

There  were  no significant anti-dilutive equity awards for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\n## Note 4 - Information on Business Segments\n\n## Overview\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments:\n\n- Aeronautics - Engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.\n- Missiles  and  Fire  Control -  Provides  air  and  missile  defense  systems;  tactical  missiles  and  air-to-ground  precision  strike weapon systems;  logistics;  fire  control  systems;  mission  operations  support,  readiness,  engineering  support  and  integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions.\n- Rotary and Mission Systems -  Designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface  ships,  sea  and  land-based  missile  defense  systems,  radar  systems,  sea  and  air-based  mission  and  combat  systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, and simulation and training solutions.\n- Space -  Engaged  in  the  research  and  development,  design,  engineering  and  production  of  satellites,  space  transportation systems,  and  strategic,  advanced  strike,  and  defensive  systems.  Space  provides  network-enabled  situational  awareness  and integrates  complex  space  and  ground  global  systems  to  help  our  customers  gather,  analyze  and  securely  distribute  critical intelligence  data.  Space  is  also  responsible  for  various  classified  systems  and  services  in  support  of  vital  national  security systems. Operating profit for our Space business segment also includes our share of earnings for our 50% ownership interest in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government. Our investment in ULA totaled $585 million and $691 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Selected Financial Data by Business Segment\n\nNet  sales  of  our  business  segments  in  the  following  tables  exclude  intersegment  sales  as  these  activities  are  eliminated  in consolidation and thus are not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nChanges in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax  laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application (including those with retroactive effect), such as the amortization for research and development expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders' equity. In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans and the change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions.\n\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. In 2024, research and development capitalization resulted in a cash tax liability of approximately $370 million and our net deferred tax assets increased by a similar amount. While the largest impact of this provision was to the 2022 cash tax liability, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease over the period and be immaterial by 2027.\n\nWe are regularly  under  audit  or  ex amination  by  tax   authorities,  including  foreign  tax   authorities  (Australia,  Canada,  India,  Italy,  Japan,  Poland,  the  United Kingdom, and other countries). The final resolution of tax audits and any related administrative reviews or litigation could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and changes to the timing of required tax payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These increases or changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.\n\nThe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15% applied on a country-by-country basis for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar 2), with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. While the United States has not enacted legislation to adopt Pillar 2 and it is uncertain if it will do so in the future, certain countries in which we operate have enacted such legislation, and other countries are in the process of doing so. We do not expect Pillar 2 to have a material impact on our effective tax  rate or our financial condition and results of operation.\n\n## Net Earnings\n\nWe reported net earnings of $5.3 billion ($22.31 per share) in 2024 and $6.9 billion ($27.55 per share) in 2023. Net earnings and earnings per share in 2024 were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 12.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2024 compared to 2023. The reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.\n\n## Business Segment Results of Operations\n\nWe operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.\n\nNet sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and thus are not included in management's evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.\n\nBusiness segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. G overnment under the applicable U.S. G overnment Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) or portions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and other items not considered part of management's evaluation of segment operating performance.

      "answer": "In 2023, MMM's Health Care segment reported a total sales change of (2.8)%, with a significant (3.1)% impact attributed to divestitures. This indicates that the Health Care segment was already undergoing strategic reductions in that year. By 2024, the separation of Solventum in April marked the culmination of this divestiture strategy. The 2024 disclosures show that former Health Care operations, including transition arrangements with Solventum, were now categorized under 'Other' and no longer part of the ongoing business segments. This evolution suggests that the 2023 divestiture activity in Health Care was a precursor to the full strategic exit of the segment, completed in early 2024.",

Because Corporate and Unallocated and Other include a variety of miscellaneous items, they are subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. Corporate and Unallocated and Other are presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in Note 22.\n\n- Corporate and Unallocated operating income (loss) includes 'corporate special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'.\n- Corporate special items include net costs for significant litigation impacting operating income (loss) associated with PFAS-related other environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters. In addition, during the voluntary chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), costs associated with the Aearo portion of respirator mask/asbestos matters were also included in corporate special items. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were not included in the Corporate net costs for significant litigation special item, instead being reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Corporate special items for the periods presented also include divestiture costs, gain on business divestitures, divestiture-related restructuring actions and Russia ex it charges/benefits. Divestiture costs include costs that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations related to separating and divesting substantially an entire business segment of 3M following public announcement of its intended divestiture.\n- Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details on the impact of special items for additional information on the components of corporate special items. Corporate special item net costs decreased year-over-year in 2024, primarily due to lower net costs for significant litigation associated with Corporate and Unallocated. Corporate special item net costs increased year-over-year in 2023, primarily due to increased net costs for significant litigation as a result of pre-tax  charges of $10.3 billion and $4.2 billion in the second and third quarters of 2023 related to the PWS Settlement and the CAE Settlement, respectively (both discussed in Note 19), and lower gains on business divestitures.\n- Other corporate expense-net includes certain enterprise and governance activities resulting in unallocated corporate costs and other activity and net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs previously allocated to Solventum prior to the Separation that were not eligible to be part of discontinued operations, commercial activity with Solventum postSeparation, and certain operations of the former Health Care business segment retained by 3M.\n- Other corporate operating expenses, net, decreased year-over-year in 2024 primarily due to the extent of non-discontinued operationseligible former Solventum-allocated costs included in Corporate and Unallocated prior to Solventum's April 2024 Separation. Other corporate operating expenses, net, increased year-over-year in 2023 primarily due to higher restructuring charges (see Note 6).\n\n## \u00b7 Other:\n\n- This category principally reflects activity associated with:\n- Operations of businesses of the former Health Care segment divested prior to the Separation and therefore not reflected as discontinued operations within 3M's financial statements, along with limited-duration supply agreements with those previous divestitures.\n- Transition arrangement agreements (e.g. fees charged by 3M, net of underlying costs) related to divested businesses, including those related to the Separation, as well as other applicable divestitures.\n- Operating income categorized as \"Other\" decreased year-over-year in 2024 primarily due to the extent of transition arrangement income from divested businesses (and associated costs) largely related to Solventum, which separated in April 2024. Operating income categorized as \"Other\" decreased year-over-year in 2023 as a result of divestiture of the Food Safety Division and dental local anesthetic businesses (both formerly part of the \"Other\" category) and the extent of transition arrangement income from divested businesses other than Solventum.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Honeywell's Performance Materials and Technologies segment included Advanced Materials as a core component, with a focus on high-performance products such as materials for bullet-resistant armor, nylon, computer chips, and pharmaceutical packaging, as well as low global-warming-potential materials based on hydrofluoro-olefin technology. By 2024, the leadership structure reflected a deepened strategic emphasis on this division, as evidenced by Ken West's progression through multiple Advanced Materials roles\u2014from President and CEO of Advanced Materials (January 2022 to July 2023) to President and CEO of Honeywell UOP (July 2023 to December 2023), and ultimately to President and CEO of Energy and Sustainability Solutions in 2024. This leadership trajectory indicates a deliberate realignment to leverage Advanced Materials' capabilities in sustainability-focused product lines. Meanwhile, Vimal Kapur\u2014who served as President and CEO of Performance Materials and Technologies from July 2021 to October 2022\u2014was promoted to CEO of the entire company in June 2023, suggesting that the strategic success of the segment played a pivotal role in shaping Honeywell\u2019s broader corporate direction.

      "answer": "In 2022, the U.S. Domestic Package Segment experienced increased revenue per piece due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, while expenses rose primarily due to higher fuel prices and employee compensation. By 2023, UPS continued to rely on fuel surcharges as a primary mechanism to offset fuel price volatility, with surcharges applied to both domestic and international package services. However, the company noted that sudden fuel price changes could significantly affect results if not matched by surcharge adjustments. This indicates a growing dependency on fuel surcharge mechanisms to maintain margin stability amid fluctuating fuel costs.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(2022) \u2192 U.S. Domestic Package Segment: Segment revenue and expenses were significantly influenced by fuel surcharges and fuel prices, respectively.",

          "chunk_text": "## Employee health and safety\n\nWe are committed to industry-leading employee health, safety and wellness programs across our growing workforce. We develop a culture of health and safety by:\n\n- investing in safety training and audits;\n- promoting wellness practices which mitigate risk; and\n- offering benefits designed to keep employees safe in the workplace and beyond.\n\nOur local health and safety committees coach employees on UPS's safety processes and are able to share best practices across work groups. Our safety methods and procedures are increasingly focused on the variables associated with residential delivery environments, which have become more common with the growth in e-commerce. We monitor our performance in this area through various measurable targets including lost time injury frequency and the number of recorded auto accidents.\n\n## Customers\n\nBuilding and maintaining long-term customer relationships is a competitive strength of UPS. In 2021, we served 1.7 million shipping customers and more than 11.8 million delivery customers daily. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, represented approximately 11.7% of our consolidated revenues, substantially all of which was within our U.S. Domestic Package segment. For additional information on our customers, see 'Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us' and note 15 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Competition\n\nWe offer a broad array of transportation and logistics services and compete with many local, regional, national and international logistics providers as well as national postal services. We believe our strategy, network and competitive strengths position us well to compete in the marketplace. For additional information on our competitive environment, see \"Risk Factors Business and Operating Risks - Our industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us\".\n\n## Government Regulation\n\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Continued compliance with increasingly stringent laws, regulations and policies in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate may result in materially increased costs, or we could be subject to substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations.\n\n## Air Operations\n\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation ('DOT'), the Federal Aviation Administration ('FAA') and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration ('TSA'), have primary regulatory authority over our air transportation services.\n\nThe DOT's authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as operating authority, insurance requirements, pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates international routes, fares, rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation, health, customs and immigration regulations imposed by governments in other countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. We have international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is subject to DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.\n\nThe FAA's authority primarily relates to operational, technical and safety aspects of air transportation, including certification, aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation.",

Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n- a gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n- transformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n- a pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\n\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\n\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\n\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n\n## 2020 compared to 2019\n\nSee Item 7.

      "answer": "In 2023, RTX valued exclusivity assets between 5 to 25 years, indicating a focus on mid-to-long-term competitive advantages. These exclusivity assets directly depended on patents and trademarks, which had a broader 5 to 30 year valuation range in 2023, suggesting longer-term protection and brand value. By 2024, RTX maintained the same 5 to 30 year range for patents and trademarks, showing strategic continuity in protecting intellectual property despite the narrower 2023 exclusivity asset window. This implies RTX likely leveraged its foundational IP portfolio to sustain exclusivity even as specific asset lifecycles approached their lower-bound estimates.",

      "answer": "In 2023, MMM faced a $0.8 billion asset impairment charge from exiting PFAS manufacturing, along with higher raw material and logistics costs, which pressured operating income margins. However, aggressive spending discipline and restructuring actions helped partially offset these pressures. By 2024, this spending discipline continued to support margin improvement, even as the company faced new dis-synergies from the spin-off of Solventum and ongoing PFAS exit activities. The persistence of disciplined cost management helped drive an overall year-on-year increase in operating income margins, adjusted for non-GAAP measures, despite these challenges.",

Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Transportation and Electronics were down 1.4 percent in U.S. dollars. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufactured products (non-GAAP measure), sales were up 3.1 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in electronics, were flat in commercial branding and transportation, and decreased in advanced materials, and in automotive and aerospace.\n- Growth was negatively impacted by headwinds related to PFAS manufactured products and automotive OEM build rates, partially offset by new product launches and spec-wins that drove share gain.\n\n## Acquisitions/divestitures:\n\n- Divestiture and acquisition impacts relate to lost/gained Transportation and Electronics sales year-on-year from the Aearo Entities. In the third quarter of 2022, 3M deconsolidated the Aearo Entities and, in the second quarter of 2023, reconsolidated those entities. For each of the 12-months postdeconsolidation and post-reconsolidation, impacts are each reflected separately as divestiture and acquisition, respectively.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year driven by benefits from non-PFAS manufacturing growth and productivity, spending discipline, and restructuring partially offset by dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Margins were also impacted by decreasing PFAS manufacturing. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufactured products (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Transportation and Electronics were down 4.5 percent in U.S. dollars. Adjusting for special item PFAS manufactured products (non-GAAP measure), sales were down 4.5 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in automotive and aerospace, were flat in commercial branding and transportation and decreased in electronics and advanced materials.\n- Growth continued to be held back by consumer electronics end-market weakness.",

      "answer": "The decrease in GD's Corporate Operating Costs from $160 million in 2023 to an expected $125 million in 2024 suggests a more measured or recalibrated approach to equity-based compensation. Since corporate operating costs are primarily composed of equity-based compensation expense, this decline indicates that GD may have adjusted its incentive compensation strategy, potentially reducing the scale or value of equity awards granted in 2024. This is further supported by the fact that equity-based compensation is a key component of G&A expenses and is directly tied to the company's long-term incentive plans for employees and directors.",

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM's operating income margins were negatively impacted by rising raw materials and logistics costs, which were only partially offset by spending discipline and restructuring actions. Specifically, these cost pressures were a key factor in the year-on-year margin decline. By 2023, the company maintained strong spending discipline, which helped offset continued inflationary pressures and manufacturing headwinds.

      "answer": "In 2022, the ongoing impact of the pandemic on commercial aerospace caused a decline in demand for air travel, which negatively affected RTX\u2019s Pratt & Whitney segment, as noted in the 2022 10-K filing. By 2023, Net Products Cost of Sales increased by $1.5 billion compared to 2022, primarily due to higher external product costs at Pratt & Whitney, Collins, and Raytheon, driven by increased product sales. This rise in cost of sales, despite pandemic-related headwinds in the prior year, suggests a recovery in commercial aerospace demand as travel restrictions eased and airlines began to ramp up operations. The increase in cost of sales reflects higher production and delivery volumes, indicating that RTX was responding to stronger market demand in 2023 after a period of constrained activity in 2022.",

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses. Refer to 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' for further  details.  While  we  have  seen  indications  that  commercial  air  travel  is  recovering,  we  continue  to  closely  monitor  our commercial aerospace assets for recoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures.

      "answer": "In 2023, EMR reported $9,475 million in cash from investing activities related to Climate Technologies, which included a significant gain on sale of business of $10,610 million. By 2024, this cash flow declined to $3,436 million, and while EMR still maintained a stake in Climate Technologies, the absence of a comparable large divestiture and the drop in net earnings from $8,809 million to $350 million suggest a strategic pivot or reduced emphasis on this segment. The entity chain evolution indicates a transformation from active divestment and capital generation to a more stable but less profitable position in Climate Technologies.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Safety and Industrial segment reported an operating income of $2,692 million, but this was significantly impacted by a $1.2 billion pre-tax charge related to the Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, which weighed heavily on margins. By 2024, while business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year, they were negatively impacted by $0.8 billion in asset impairment charges related to PFAS manufacturing exit activities. The nature of margin pressures shifted from litigation-driven in 2022 to operationally driven in 2024, with the segment benefiting from productivity and spending discipline, but facing headwinds from restructuring costs, inflation, and supply chain issues. The evolution from litigation costs to operational restructuring shows a transition in the primary drivers of margin performance in the Safety and Industrial segment.",

For Safety and Industrial these adjustments include net costs related to respirator mask/asbestos (Aearo-related and non-Aearo related). During the voluntary Aearo chapter 11 bankruptcy period (which began in July 2022 and ended in June 2023), net costs related to Aearo-respirator mask/asbestos matters were reflected as corporate special items in Corporate and Unallocated while those associated with non-Aearo respirator mask/asbestos matters continued to be reflected as special items in the Safety and Industrial business segment. Prior to the bankruptcy, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs matters were reflected in the Safety and Industrial business segment (rather than reflected in Corporate and Unallocated-see Note 22 for additional information). Refer to the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section for additional details.\n\n## Year 2024 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were flat in U.S. dollars.\n\n## On an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules, industrial adhesives and tapes and in electrical markets, were flat in automotive aftermarket and personal safety, and decreased in industrial specialties and abrasives.\n- Industrial end market demand was mixed as end user and channel remain cautious, including weaker EMEA industrial and manufacturing environment. Growth primarily driven by strength in bonding solutions for electronic devices, cable accessories, auto body repair and roofing granules driven by replacement demand for residential roofs.\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily driven by benefits from growth, productivity and spending discipline partially offset by translation, growth investments and dis-synergies due to the spin of Solventum. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins increased year-on-year as displayed above.\n\n## Year 2023 results:\n\nSales in Safety and Industrial were down 5.6 percent in U.S. dollars.\n\nOn an organic sales basis:\n\n- Sales increased in roofing granules and automotive aftermarket; decreased in personal safety, industrial specialties, industrial adhesives and tapes, abrasives and electrical markets.\n- Growth was held back by the disposable respirator sales decline within personal safety along with the exit of Russia (which, together, negatively impacted year-on-year organic growth by 5.2 percentage points); declines within industrial adhesives and tapes due to consumer electronics softness, industrial specialties was down as consumers pulled back on discretionary spending impacting e-commerce shipments (slowing down in packaging and shipping activity).\n\nBusiness segment operating income margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special item costs for significant litigation. 2022 was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion related to steps toward resolving Combat Arms Earplugs litigation. Margins were also impacted by aggressive spending discipline, benefits from restructuring, pricing and productivity actions offset by the lower sales volume, higher restructuring costs, inflation impacts, investments in the business and China-related challenges. Adjusting for special item costs for significant litigation (non-GAAP measure), business segment operating income margins were consistent year-on-year.",

      "answer": "In 2022, BA's BCA segment recorded $1,753 million in abnormal production costs, with $1,240 million tied to the 787 program and $325 million to the 777X program. These costs were a key factor in BCA's $2,341 million loss from operations that year. By 2024, abnormal production costs had decreased to $443 million, with $4,079 million in reach-forward losses now attributed to both the 777X and 767 programs. This shift indicates a reduction in abnormal production cost burden, though it was offset by new challenges like the 737-9 grounding and IAM 751 work stoppage. The trajectory shows a significant decline in abnormal production costs from $1,753 million in 2022 to $443 million in 2024, suggesting operational improvements in the 787 and 777X programs, even as other cost pressures emerged.",

Where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.\n\nMultiple legal actions have been filed against us as a result of the October 29, 2018 accident of Lion Air Flight 610 and the  March  10,  2019  accident  of  Ethiopian Airlines  Flight  302.  During  the  fourth  quarter  of  2021,  we  entered  into  a proposed settlement with plaintiffs in a shareholder derivative lawsuit. Under the proposed settlement, which is subject to court approval, the Company would receive monetary payments of approximately $237, before attorneys' fees, and commit to making certain governance changes. Further, we are subject to, and cooperating with, ongoing governmental and regulatory  investigations  and  inquiries  relating  to  the  accidents  and  the  737  MAX. Among  these  is  an  ongoing investigation  by  the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  the  outcome  of  which  may  be  material.  Other  than  with respect to the agreement described below with the U.S. Department of Justice entered in 2021, we cannot reasonably estimate  a  range  of  loss,  if  any,  not  covered  by  available  insurance  that  may  result  given  the  current  status  of  the pending lawsuits, investigations and inquiries related to the 737 MAX.\n\nOn  January  6,  2021,  we  entered  into  a  Deferred  Prosecution Agreement  with  the  U.S.  Department  of  Justice  that resolves the Department of Justice's previously disclosed investigation into us regarding the evaluation of the 737 MAX airplane by the Federal Aviation Administration. Under the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, we agreed to the filing of a criminal information charging the Company with one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States, based on the conduct of two former 737 MAX program technical pilots; the criminal information will be dismissed after three years, provided that we comply with our obligations under the agreement. The Deferred Prosecution Agreement requires that we make payments totaling $2,510, which consist of (a) a $244 criminal monetary penalty; (b) $500 in additional compensation to the heirs and/or beneficiaries of those who died in the Lion Air Flight 610 and Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 accidents; and (c) $1,770 to the Company's airline customers for harm incurred as a result of the grounding of the 737 MAX, offset in part by payments already made and the remainder satisfied through payments to be made prior to the termination of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. The agreement also requires that we review our compliance program and undertake continuous improvement efforts with respect to it, and implement enhanced compliance reporting and internal controls mechanisms. We expensed $744 in the fourth quarter of 2020 related to this agreement. During the first quarter, consistent with the terms of the Deferred Prosecution Agreement, the monetary penalty was paid, and the $500 compensation amount was transferred to a fund established to benefit the heirs and/or beneficiaries of the victims of the 737 MAX accidents. In addition, the $1,770 amount related to the Company's airline customers was included in amounts reserved in prior quarters for 737 MAX customer considerations.\n\nDuring 2019, we entered into agreements with Embraer S.A. (Embraer) to establish joint ventures that included the commercial  aircraft  and  services  operations  of  Embraer,  of  which  we  were  expected  to  acquire  an  80  percent ownership stake for $4,200, as well as a joint venture to promote and develop new markets for the C-390 Millennium. In 2020, we exercised our contractual right to terminate these agreements based on Embraer's failure to meet certain required closing conditions. Embraer has disputed our right to terminate the agreements, and the dispute is currently in arbitration. We cannot reasonably estimate a range of loss, if any, that may result from the arbitration.\n\n## Note 22 - Segment and Revenue Information\n\nOur primary profitability measurements to review a segment's operating results are Earnings/(loss) from operations and operating margins.

However, by 2023, MMM faced a 4.7% decline in organic sales and a 0.2% negative translation effect, resulting in an overall sales decrease of 5.0%.

      "answer": "In 2022, MMM reported strong organic sales growth of 9.0%, reflecting overall positive momentum across its business segments. However, by 2023, the Safety and Industrial segment specifically experienced a -5.1% organic sales decline, marking a significant reversal. This downturn occurred alongside MMM's strategic shift in 2023, including the internal realignment of segment performance metrics and the spin-off of the Health Care business announced in mid-2022.

This indicates that FDX's pension liability became less sensitive to upward movements in discount rates over this period, suggesting a potential shift in the composition or duration of pension obligations.

      "question": "How did the increase in Cat Financial's long-term receivables from $33 million in 2022 to $23,299 million in 2023 reflect changes in the fair value of financial products and what does this imply about the company's financial services expansion strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2022, Cat Financial's long-term receivables under the Financial Products segment were reported at a fair value of $33 million. By 2023, the Financial Products segment's liabilities had a fair value of $23,299 million, indicating a significant increase in the scale of financial services activities. This dramatic growth suggests a strategic expansion in Cat Financial's role, likely involving increased financing offerings to dealers and customers. The change highlights how long-term receivables feed into the broader financial products segment and reflect an intensified focus on financial services as part of CAT's business model.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GE had indemnification obligations to GE HealthCare totaling $81 million related to the separation, which were fully reserved (Hop 1). These indemnifications contributed directly to GE HealthCare's portion of 'Other Income, Costs and Expenses,' which was $50 million in 2023 (Hop 2). By 2024, GE HealthCare's share of 'Other Income, Costs and Expenses' had increased to $4,842 million, indicating a significant shift in financial responsibility or ongoing costs tied to the separation (Hop 3). This shows that while initial indemnifications were relatively small, the longer-term financial impact on GE HealthCare through shared expenses grew substantially post-separation.",

        "Hop 1: GE(2023) \u2192 GE HealthCare: GE had indemnification obligations of $81 million to GE HealthCare post-separation, fully reserved.",

      "answer": "EMR's Climate Technologies segment saw a significant drop in Earnings Before Income Taxes (EBIT) from $1,002M in 2022 to $435M in 2024. This decline directly affected the segment's contribution to overall net earnings after tax. In 2022, the segment's Earnings, Net of Tax were $793M, while in 2024 they dropped to $350M, reflecting a steep decline in profitability. This reduction contributed to a broader downward trend in EMR's total Earnings, Net of Tax, which fell from $1,347M in 2022 to $350M in 2024. The segment's underperformance was further exacerbated by a drop in net sales from $4,976M in 2022 to no reported revenue in 2024, suggesting a strategic exit or restructuring that significantly altered the company's earnings profile.",

      "answer": "General Dynamics' Aerospace segment achieved a book-to-bill ratio of 1.6-to-1 in 2021, which directly contributed to a 40% increase in backlog from $11.6 billion in 2020 to $16.3 billion by the end of 2021. This strong order intake included significant commitments for new aircraft models like the G400 (scheduled for 2025 delivery) and G800 (scheduled for 2023 delivery), which created long lead times between order placement and revenue recognition. By 2024, this backlog translated into revenue recognition patterns where 24% of total revenue came from point-in-time recognition\u2014primarily from the delivery and acceptance of fully outfitted business jet aircraft in the Aerospace segment. The high book-to-bill ratio in 2021 thus set the foundation for sustained revenue generation in 2024, as the company fulfilled orders placed years earlier under long-term manufacturing contracts.",

These assum ptions i n cl u de  l abor  producti vi ty   an d  av ai l abi l i ty ;  th e  com pl ex i ty   of   th e  work  to  be  perf orm ed;  th e  cost  an d  av ai l abi l i ty   of   m ateri al s;  th e  perf orm an ce  of subcontractors; and the availability and tim ing of funding from  the custom er.\n\nThe nature of our contracts gives rise to several types of variable consideration, including claim s, award fees and incentive fees. W e include in our contract estim ates additional revenue for contract m odifications or claim s against the custom er when we believe we have an enforceable right to the modification or claim , the am ount can be estim ated reliably and its realization is probable. In evaluating these criteria, we consider the contractual/legal basis for the claim , the cause of any additional costs incurred, the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim . W e include award fees or incentive fees in the estim ated transaction price when there is a basis to reasonably estim ate the am ount of the fee. These estim ates are based on historical award experience, anticipated perform ance and our best inform ed judgm ent at the tim e.\n\nAs a significant change in one or m ore of these estim ates could affect the profitability of our contracts, we review and update our contract-related estim ates regularly . W e recognize adjustm ents in estim ated profit on contracts under the cum ulative catch-up m ethod. Under this m ethod, the im pact of the adjustm ent on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustm ent is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract perform ance are recognized using the adjusted estim ate. If at any tim e the estim ate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, we recognize the total loss in the period it is identified.\n\nThe impact of adjustm ents in contract estim ates on our operating earnings can be reflected in either operating costs and expenses or revenue. The aggregate im pact of adjustm ents in contract estim ates increased our revenue, operating earnings and diluted earnings per share as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's Financial Products segment exposure to Trade and Other Receivables increased significantly from $109 million in 2022 to $9,282 million in 2024. This indicates a substantial shift in the segment\u2019s role, moving from a minor contributor to receivables in 2022 to a central component of the company\u2019s financial position by 2024. The segment\u2019s fair value contribution to Trade and Other Receivables in 2022 was relatively small compared to the overall $9,282 million in Receivables - Trade and Other disclosed in 2024, suggesting that the segment became more integral to the company\u2019s credit and financing operations over time.",
