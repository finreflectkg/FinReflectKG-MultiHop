      "answer": "In 2022, Linde disclosed that pre-tax charges were shown as a separate line item within operating profit and were excluded from the management definition of segment operating profit, requiring reconciliation (Hop 1). By 2023, the APAC segment specifically reported a positive $136 million (8%) increase in operating profit driven by pricing and productivity, with no mention of similar charges affecting the segment (Hop 3). This indicates that Linde's APAC operations experienced a significant improvement in profitability that was not offset by the types of charges reported in 2022, suggesting a strategic shift toward stabilizing and growing regional profitability (Hop 2 connects operating profit to APAC Segment performance).",

      "answer": "In 2022, LIN disclosed that special charges were excluded from the management definition of segment operating profit for the APAC region, as shown in Note 18 of their financial statements. This exclusion meant that the APAC segment's operating profit appeared higher than the consolidated operating profit that included these charges. In 2024, the APAC segment reported a $112 million (6%) increase in operating profit driven by volume growth and productivity, with no mention of similar charge exclusions. This suggests that the 2024 performance reflects a more normalized operating environment without the distortions from special charges that were present in 2022.",

        "Hop 1: LIN(2022) \u2192 Operating Profit: LIN disclosed special charges affecting operating profit calculations and excluded them from segment operating profit in Note 18",

As  further  described  in  the  following paragraph,  Linde's  industrial  gases  operations  are  managed  on  a  geographic  basis,  which  represents  three  of  the  company's reportable segments - Americas, EMEA (Europe/Middle East/Africa), and APAC (Asia/South Pacific); a fourth reportable segment which  represents  the  company's  Engineering  business  which  designs  and  manufactures  equipment  for  air  separation  and  other industrial  gas  applications  specifically  for  end  customers  and  is  managed  on  a  worldwide  basis  operating  in  all  geographic segments. Other consists of corporate costs and a few smaller businesses which individually do not meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation.\n\nThe industrial gases product line centers on the manufacturing and distribution of atmospheric gases (oxygen, nitrogen, argon, rare gases) and process gases (carbon dioxide, helium, hydrogen, electronic gases, specialty gases, acetylene). Many of these products are co-products of the same manufacturing process. Linde manufactures and distributes nearly all of its products and manages its customer relationships on a regional basis. Linde's industrial gases are distributed to various end-markets within a regional segment through  one  of  three  basic  distribution  methods:  on-site  or  tonnage;  merchant  or  bulk;  and  packaged  or  cylinder  gases.  The distribution  methods  are  generally  integrated  in  order  to  best  meet  the  customer's  needs  and  very  few  of  its  products  can  be economically transported outside of a region. Therefore, the distribution economics are specific to the various geographies in which the company operates and are consistent with how management assesses performance.\n\nThe  company's  measure  of  profit/loss  for  segment  reporting  purposes  is  segment  operating  profit.  Segment  operating  profit  is defined as operating profit excluding purchase accounting impacts of the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and items not indicative  of  ongoing  business  trends. This  is  the  manner  in  which  the  company's  Chief  Operating  Decision  Maker  (\"CODM\") assesses performance and allocates resources.\n\nThe  table  below  presents  sales  and  operating  profit  information  about  reportable  segments  and  Other  for  the  years  ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n",

The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023.

Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.

The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "question": "How did the impact of lower volumes on Linde's operating profit evolve from 2023 to 2024, and what does this reveal about the company's ability to maintain profitability despite volume headwinds?",
      "answer": "In 2023, lower volumes were cited as a key adverse factor impacting operating profit, alongside cost inflation, despite higher pricing and productivity savings. By 2024, the EMEA segment specifically noted a 1% volume decline led by the manufacturing end market, which partially offset gains from pricing and productivity, yet operating profit still increased by 12% in that segment. Company-wide, Linde reported an 8% increase in operating profit for 2024, driven by pricing and productivity, despite continued volume pressures. This shows that Linde improved its ability to insulate operating profit from volume declines through stronger pricing power and cost control in 2024 compared to 2023.",

The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "In 2022, LIN's segment reporting excluded certain charges from its definition of segment operating profit, which were instead reconciled at the consolidated level, indicating a focus on underlying performance metrics. By 2024, despite a $190 million (2%) sales decline in the EMEA segment due to cost pass-through and volume reductions, operating profit for the region rose by $294 million (12%), primarily driven by pricing and productivity gains. This suggests that while top-line pressures persisted, the company's strategic actions\u2014such as pricing adjustments and cost control\u2014had a stronger positive effect on profitability in 2024 than the negative sales trend might suggest, reflecting an evolution in how operating profit responded to segment-level dynamics.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde explicitly excluded charges from its management definition of segment operating profit, as noted in the Segment Information (Note 18), indicating a focus on core operational performance by excluding one-time or non-recurring impacts. By 2024, the APAC segment reported an $112 million (6%) increase in operating profit, driven by volume growth and productivity initiatives. This improvement suggests that the company's strategic focus on core operations, established in 2022, translated into tangible profitability gains in the APAC region by 2024. The evolution from excluding charges to achieving strong segment-level growth highlights Linde's improved execution and regional performance management over the two-year period.",

In 2024, the APAC segment reported a $112 million (6%) increase in operating profit, driven by volume growth and productivity initiatives, despite facing currency headwinds from the weakening Korean won and Chinese yuan.

In 2024, the segment's operating profit increased by 6% ($112 million), with growth attributed to volume increases and project start-ups, particularly in the electronics end market. This indicates a slight decline in the segment\u2019s growth rate but still a strong and positive impact on overall profitability.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

By 2024, the APAC segment's operating profit grew by $112 million (6%), and this growth was again reported independently from any consolidated charges, indicating that the segment's contribution to consolidated operating profit increased in absolute dollar terms but at a slower growth rate compared to 2022.

      "answer": "In 2023, lower volumes negatively impacted Linde's operating profit, decreasing sales by 1% globally and 4% in the EMEA segment, primarily due to weakness in the chemicals and energy end markets. Despite this, operating profit increased by 49% year-over-year, driven by higher pricing, productivity initiatives, and lower depreciation. In 2024, operating profit grew by 8% year-over-year, with the company attributing this growth to higher pricing and productivity savings that more than offset cost inflation and currency pressures. This shows that while lower volumes remained a challenge in 2023, Linde was able to maintain margin resilience and continue improving profitability in 2024 through pricing discipline and cost control.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "In 2022, LIN's consolidated operating profit included pre-tax charges that were excluded from segment operating profit, indicating a complex relationship between corporate-level costs and segment-level performance. In the APAC segment, 2021 saw an 18% increase in operating profit ($225 million) driven by volume growth, pricing, and productivity, despite a $126 million reduction from the deconsolidation of a joint venture in Taiwan. By 2023, the APAC segment continued to grow, with operating profit increasing by $136 million (8%), primarily due to pricing and productivity, despite currency headwinds. This suggests that while the APAC segment remained a key growth engine, the impact of external factors like currency and corporate-level charges introduced complexity in translating operating profit improvements into consistent year-over-year gains.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LIN's APAC segment operating profit increased by $225 million (18%), driven by volume growth (11%), higher pricing (2%), and productivity gains, despite a $126 million reduction from the deconsolidation of a joint venture in Taiwan. By 2023, the APAC segment\u2019s operating profit grew by $136 million (8%), primarily due to pricing and productivity, which offset currency headwinds (a 4% decrease from the weakening of the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, and Chinese yuan) and cost inflation. The slower growth in 2023 compared to 2022 suggests that while pricing and cost control remained effective, external pressures\u2014especially currency fluctuations\u2014negatively impacted the segment\u2019s ability to maintain the prior year\u2019s momentum, indicating a shift in the operating environment that likely originated from the dynamics first seen in late 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.

      "answer": "In 2021 versus 2020, the APAC segment's operating profit increased by $225 million, driven by higher volumes, pricing, and productivity initiatives, despite a $126 million reduction from the deconsolidation of a joint venture (2022 filing). In 2023 versus 2022, the APAC segment's operating profit rose by $136 million, primarily due to higher pricing and continued productivity efforts, which offset currency headwinds and cost inflation (2023 filing). The chain shows that while both periods benefited from pricing and productivity, the growth in operating profit slowed from 18% in 2021 to 8% in 2023, likely due to the earlier segment disruption from divestitures and new pressures from currency movements.",

This strong performance was driven by higher volumes, pricing, and productivity initiatives. By 2024, the company's overall operating profit increased by $611 million (8%) on a reported basis, with productivity initiatives and pricing again cited as key drivers. However, the APAC segment also experienced a divestiture impact in 2024, which affected employee count and noncontrolling interests (increased by $30 million to $172 million).

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

This divestiture also contributed to a 12% decrease in APAC sales. By 2024, the APAC segment still played a role in the company's overall operating profit, but the segment's influence was evolving, as seen in the $30 million increase in noncontrolling interests primarily in APAC (mainly China), which included the impact of another divestiture. Despite the earlier reduction in APAC's operating profit, the company reported an overall 8% increase in operating profit in 2024, driven by pricing and productivity initiatives, suggesting that the company may have offset the earlier APAC-related losses through strategic adjustments in other areas or within the segment itself.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "question": "How did the divestiture of the joint venture in Taiwan in 2021 impact the APAC segment's operating profit growth from 2022 to 2024, and what was the resulting effect on Linde's overall operating profit performance in 2024?",
      "answer": "The divestiture of the joint venture in Taiwan in 2021 reduced the APAC segment's operating profit by $126 million in 2021 compared to 2020, as stated in the 2022 10-K filing. Despite this reduction, the APAC segment still achieved an 18% increase in operating profit in 2021 due to higher volumes, pricing, and productivity initiatives. By 2024, Linde's overall operating profit increased by $611 million (8%) year-over-year, driven by pricing and productivity gains that offset cost inflation and currency effects. However, the 2024 financial report also noted a divestiture in the APAC segment that impacted noncontrolling interests, which increased from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024. This suggests that while the earlier divestiture in Taiwan had a measurable negative impact on APAC's profitability in 2021, Linde was able to offset this through strategic pricing and cost management, contributing to a strong operating profit growth by 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023.

By 2024, this dynamic reversed, with cost pass-through positively contributing 1% to sales growth, despite a $73 million (1%) total sales increase. This shift indicates that LIN adjusted its pricing strategy in the APAC region, moving from absorbing cost pressures in 2023 to passing them on to customers in 2024, while maintaining volume growth (2% in both years), suggesting improved pricing power or cost management flexibility.",

      "answer": "In 2023, volume negatively impacted overall company sales by 1%, but within the APAC segment, volume increased by 2%, contributing to a $79 million (1%) sales increase and an $136 million (8%) operating profit increase. In 2024, volume continued to grow by 2% in the APAC segment, driving a $73 million (1%) sales increase and a $112 million (6%) operating profit increase, despite currency headwinds. This shows that while volume was a drag at the corporate level in 2023, it became a consistent growth driver in the APAC segment across both years, with stronger operating leverage in 2024 as evidenced by the 17.7% to 22.7% operating margin expansion.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde invested $994 million (32% of total capital expenditures) in the APAC segment, indicating a strategic focus on growth in the region. By 2023, this investment translated into a 2% volume increase in the APAC segment, fueled by project start-ups in electronics and chemicals. However, despite this regional volume growth, Linde's global sales volume decreased by 1% year-over-year in 2023, suggesting that volume declines in other segments outweighed the APAC segment's gains. This contrast highlights how strong regional performance in APAC was insufficient to offset volume weakness elsewhere in the business.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde allocated 32% of its $3,086 million capital expenditures to the APAC segment, indicating significant investment in new plant and production equipment. By 2024, the APAC segment reported a $112 million (6%) increase in operating profit, attributed to volume growth from project start-ups and productivity initiatives. This aligns with the typical multi-year implementation cycle of industrial gas projects, suggesting that earlier capital investments enabled the project start-ups that contributed to the 2024 profit growth.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "In 2021, the APAC segment's operating profit increased by $225 million, or 18%, but this would have been higher if not for a $126 million reduction caused by the deconsolidation of a joint venture in Taiwan. This deconsolidation significantly dampened the segment's profitability despite strong volume and pricing gains. By 2023, the company's operating profit growth was instead being driven upward by pricing actions and acquisitions, such as the acquisition of nexAir, LLC, which contributed to a $512 million, or 14%, increase in the Americas segment's operating profit. This contrast highlights a strategic shift from loss of control in APAC to growth through pricing and M&A in the Americas within two years.",

        "Hop 2: APAC Segment \u2192 Operating Profit: The APAC segment had a direct and measurable negative impact on operating profit due to the joint venture deconsolidation, despite overall positive performance in volumes and pricing.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LIN's operating profit was influenced by the APAC segment, which saw an 18% increase in operating profit in 2021 versus 2020, driven by higher volumes and pricing, despite a $126 million reduction from the deconsolidation of a joint venture in Taiwan. By 2023, the APAC segment's operating profit increased by 8% compared to 2022, primarily due to higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which offset the negative impact of currency fluctuations\u2014specifically, the weakening of the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, and Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar.

Despite these volume declines persisting into 2023, operating profit increased by 49% year-over-year, indicating that the negative impact of lower volumes was outweighed by other factors such as pricing and productivity improvements.

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde's pricing strategy contributed 3% to sales growth, driven by higher pricing across all geographic segments. This pricing momentum continued into 2023, where EMEA reported a 9% increase in sales from pricing and the Americas reported a 6% increase. Despite volume declines in EMEA (-4%) and flat volumes in the Americas, operating profit increased by 23% in EMEA and 14% in the Americas, largely due to the sustained pricing strategy and productivity initiatives. However, cost pass-through negatively impacted sales by 3% in EMEA and 6% in the Americas, though with minimal effect on operating profit. Thus, the pricing strategy initiated in 2022 had a cascading positive impact on operating profit in 2023, even amidst volume and cost challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2021 Compared With 2020\n\n## Sales\n\nLinde sales increased $3,550 million, or 13%, for the 2021 year versus 2020. Volume growth across all end markets and project start ups increased sales by 8%. Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 3% to sales. Currency translation increased sales by 2%, largely in EMEA and APAC, driven by the strengthening of the Euro, Australian dollar, Chinese yuan and British pound against the U.S. dollar. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers, increased sales by 3%, with minimal impact on operating profit. Divestitures decreased sales by 3% primarily driven by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n\nCost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, increased $2,160 million, or 14%, for the year primarily due to higher volumes, cost pass-through and currency impacts, partially offset by productivity initiatives. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 57.0% and 56.5% of sales, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase as a percentage of sales was due primarily to higher cost pass-through.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (\"SG&amp;A\") decreased $4 million, from $3,193 in 2020 to $3,189 million in 2021. SG&amp;A was 10.4% of sales in 2021 versus 11.7% in 2020, primarily due to continued productivity initiatives and the impact of higher cost pass-through on sales. Currency impacts increased SG&amp;A by approximately $62 million in 2021. Excluding currency impacts, underlying SG&amp;A decreased due to continued productivity initiatives.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nReported depreciation and amortization expense increased $9 million versus 2020. The increase is primarily due to currency translation impacts, partially offset by a decrease related primarily to intangible assets acquired in the merger becoming fully amortized.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased $66 million, or 2%, versus 2020. The increase is primarily due to currency translation impacts which increased depreciation and amortization by approximately $60 million in 2021. Excluding currency impacts, underlying depreciation was relatively flat as the impact of new project start ups was largely offset by the decrease related to the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Cost reduction programs and other charges\n\nLinde recorded cost reduction programs and other charges of $273 million and $506 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily associated with the company's cost reduction program, which represents charges for achieving synergies and cost efficiencies related to the merger (see Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\nOn an adjusted basis, these costs have been excluded in both periods.\n\n## Operating profit\n\nReported operating profit increased $1,662 million in 2021, or 50%. On an adjusted basis, operating profit increased $1,379 million, or 24%, for 2021 versus 2020.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LIN excluded pre-tax charges from its management definition of segment operating profit, which changed how performance was measured and could have shifted focus toward underlying operational improvements (Hop 1). This change coincided with the APAC segment reporting a strong $225 million (18%) operating profit increase in 2021 versus 2020, driven by volume, pricing, and productivity, despite a $126 million reduction from the deconsolidation of a joint venture in Taiwan (Hop 2). By 2024, APAC delivered a $112 million (6%) operating profit increase, attributed to volume growth and productivity gains outpacing currency and cost inflation, suggesting that the earlier operational focus may have contributed to sustained, albeit slower, growth (Hop 3).",

In 2021 (vs. 2020), the APAC segment contributed a $225 million or 18% increase in operating profit, driven by higher volumes (+11%) and price increases, despite a $126 million reduction from the deconsolidation of a Taiwan joint venture. By 2024 (vs. 2023), APAC operating profit increased by $112 million or 6%, primarily due to volume growth from project start-ups, especially in electronics, and productivity gains, which offset currency headwinds and cost inflation. This suggests that while the APAC segment continued to positively influence consolidated operating profit, the growth rate of that influence slowed from 18% to 6% year-over-year, reflecting changing market conditions and reduced pricing power.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LIN's operating profit increased by 9% ($38 million) in the Engineering segment, driven primarily by currency effects, favorable cost performance, and project timing. By 2024, the company reported an 8% increase in operating profit ($611 million), with growth attributed to higher pricing and productivity initiatives that offset cost inflation, currency impacts, and charges from cost reduction programs. The connector evidence shows that operating profit grew consistently across both years (from $2,816 million in 2022 to $4,135 million in 2024), indicating sustained profitability momentum. However, the nature of the drivers evolved: while currency played a positive role in both years, 2024 saw a more deliberate focus on pricing and productivity as counterweights to inflationary pressures, suggesting a strategic shift in managing profitability.",

The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "In 2023, LIN's APAC segment contributed significantly to the company's financial health, with its operating profit increasing by $136 million (8%) due to higher pricing and productivity gains, despite currency headwinds. This trend carried into 2024, where company-wide operating profit rose by $611 million (8%) on a reported basis, driven by similar factors\u2014pricing and productivity\u2014suggesting that the APAC segment's success was part of a broader, sustained strategy. However, 2024 introduced new challenges, including a 28% ($56 million) increase in interest expense due to higher borrowings and interest rates, and a $1,632 million negative impact from currency translation adjustments, which likely included continued pressure from the weakening of the Chinese Yuan and Indian rupee. Despite these headwinds, the company maintained strong operating profit growth, indicating that the gains from the APAC segment in 2023 had a lasting positive impact on the company's financial trajectory.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "The divestiture of the Taiwan joint venture in 2021 reduced the APAC segment's operating profit by $126 million in that year, as reported in Linde plc's 2022 10-K filing. Despite this reduction, the APAC segment rebounded with strong performance driven by higher volumes, pricing, and productivity initiatives. By 2024, operating profit increased by $611 million (8%) on a reported basis, with the APAC segment continuing to play a significant role, despite facing cost inflation and the impact of cost reduction programs.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

(see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde disclosed that pre-tax charges were shown as a separate line item within operating profit and excluded from the management definition of segment operating profit, requiring a reconciliation (Hop 1). By 2023, the APAC segment reported a $136 million (8%) increase in operating profit, driven by pricing and productivity despite currency and cost pressures (Hop 3). The $79 million sales increase in APAC in 2023 (Hop 2) contributed to this improved operating profit, suggesting that Linde's strategy to manage segment-level profitability\u2014by excluding certain charges and focusing on pricing and productivity\u2014was effective in the APAC region. This indicates a consistent and strategic approach to regional profitability management across the two years.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "question": "How did the change in operating profit dynamics from 2023 to 2024 reflect the evolving contribution of the APAC segment to Linde's overall profitability, particularly in light of differing volume and pricing trends between the Americas and APAC regions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Americas segment saw a $512 million (14%) increase in operating profit driven by pricing and acquisitions, while the APAC segment in 2024 reported a $112 million (6%) operating profit increase fueled by volume growth and project start-ups. This shift indicates a move from pricing-led profitability in the Americas to volume-driven gains in APAC, showing a strategic realignment where the APAC segment became more impactful to overall operating profit in 2024 despite flat pricing, compared to the strong pricing tailwinds seen in the Americas in 2023.",

        "Hop 1: LIN(2023) \u2192 Operating Profit: The Americas segment contributed a $512 million (14%) operating profit increase driven by pricing and acquisitions.",

By 2023, the Americas segment reported a 14% increase in operating profit, partly driven by a 5-percentage-point favorable impact from prior-year impairments, including those on intangible assets. This favorable year-over-year comparison contributed to the strong growth in operating profit, as the prior-year base was reduced by the impairment charges.

A disruption in supply of such raw materials could impact Linde's ability to meet contractual supply commitments.\n\n## Linde's international operations are subject to the risks of doing business abroad and international events and circumstances may adversely impact its business, financial condition or results of operations.\n\nLinde has substantial international operations which are subject to risks including devaluations in currency exchange rates, transportation delays and interruptions, political and economic instability and disruptions, restrictions on the transfer of funds, trade conflicts and the imposition of duties and tariffs, import and export controls, changes in governmental policies, labor unrest, possible nationalization and/or expropriation of assets, changes in U.S. and non-U.S. tax policies and compliance with governmental regulations. These events could have an adverse effect on the international operations of Linde in the future by reducing the demand for its products, decreasing the prices at which it can sell its products, reducing the revenue from international operations or otherwise having an adverse effect on its business.\n\n## Currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect Linde's results.\n\nBecause a significant portion of Linde's revenue is denominated in currencies other than its reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, changes in exchange rates will produce fluctuations in revenue, costs and earnings and may also affect the book value of assets and liabilities and related equity. Although the company from time to time utilizes foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge these exposures, its efforts to minimize currency exposure through such hedging transactions may not be successful depending on market and business conditions. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect Linde's financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n\n## Macroeconomic factors may impact Linde's ability to obtain financing or increase the cost of obtaining financing which may adversely impact Linde's financial results and/or cash flows.\n\nVolatility and disruption in the U.S., European and global credit and equity markets, from time to time, could make it more difficult for Linde to obtain financing for its operations and/or could increase the cost of obtaining financing. In addition, Linde's borrowing costs can be affected by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies which are based, in significant part, on its performance as measured by certain criteria such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. A decrease in these debt ratings could increase the cost of borrowing or make it more difficult to obtain financing.\n\n## An impairment of goodwill or intangible assets could negatively impact the company's financial results.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the net carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $27 billion and $2 billion, respectively, primarily as a result of the business combination and the related acquisition method of accounting applied to Linde AG. In accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, the company periodically assesses these assets to determine if they are impaired. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to business, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets, divestitures and sustained market capitalization declines may result in recognition of impairments to goodwill or other indefinite-lived assets. Any charges relating to such impairments could have a material adverse impact on Linde's results of operations in the periods recognized.\n\n## Catastrophic events could disrupt the operations of Linde and/or its customers and suppliers and may have a significant adverse impact on the results of operations.\n\nThe occurrence of catastrophic events or natural disasters such as extreme weather, including hurricanes and floods; health epidemics; and acts of war or terrorism, could disrupt or delay Linde's ability to produce and distribute its products to customers and could potentially expose Linde to third-party liability claims. In addition, such events could impact Linde's customers and suppliers resulting in temporary or long-term outages and/or the limitation of supply of energy and other raw materials used in normal business operations. Linde evaluates the direct and indirect business risks, consults with vendors, insurance providers and industry experts, makes investments in suitably resilient design and technology, and conducts regular reviews of the business risks with management. Despite these steps, however, these situations are outside Linde's control and may have a significant adverse impact on its financial results.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LIN disclosed that it excluded certain charges from its management definition of segment operating profit for the APAC region, reconciling these figures to consolidated operating profit (Hop 1). This means that the APAC segment's operating profit figures, including the 2021 increase of $225 million or 18%, were reported on a basis that excluded these charges (Hop 2). By 2024, the APAC segment reported a 6% increase in operating profit, or $112 million, which was also managed under the same reporting methodology (Hop 3). Therefore, the 2024 growth figure should be interpreted in light of the consistent exclusion of charges, allowing for a comparable view of operational performance across years.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

In contrast, 2024 pricing was flat, with the $112 million (6%) operating profit increase instead driven by volume growth from project start-ups.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Americas segment saw a $512 million (14%) increase in operating profit driven by higher pricing, acquisitions (notably nexAir, LLC), and productivity initiatives, which offset cost inflation. In contrast, the EMEA segment in 2024 reported a $294 million (12%) operating profit increase, primarily from pricing and productivity, but partially offset by cost inflation and lower volumes\u2014especially in manufacturing. While both regions benefited from pricing and productivity, the EMEA growth was smaller in dollar terms and percentage, and was weighed down by volume declines not seen in the Americas. This reveals a divergence in regional performance, with the Americas leveraging acquisitions and stable volumes for stronger profit growth, whereas EMEA faced headwinds despite similar strategic levers.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Linde disclosed pre-tax charges within operating profit in its consolidated financial statements, which were explicitly excluded from the management definition of segment operating profit (as noted in Note 18 Segment Information). These charges were not part of the APAC segment's performance evaluation. In 2023, the APAC segment reported a significant $136 million (8%) increase in operating profit, primarily driven by higher pricing and continued productivity initiatives that offset currency headwinds and cost inflation. The exclusion of pre-tax charges in 2022 allowed for a clearer view of the segment's operational performance, which improved meaningfully in 2023 due to strategic pricing and efficiency gains.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2021 (reported in the 2022 10-K), Linde allocated 42% of its capital expenditures to the Americas and 32% to APAC, signaling a regional investment bias. This strategic tilt intensified in 2023 when the Americas segment saw a $512 million (14%) increase in operating profit, driven by pricing, the nexAir acquisition, and productivity gains. Meanwhile, the APAC segment's 2021 operating profit growth of $225 million (18%) was partially offset by the deconsolidation of a Taiwan joint venture. The shift reflects a strategic refocusing on the Americas, supported by both capital allocation patterns and targeted acquisitions like nexAir, which translated into stronger operating profit growth in 2023 compared to prior performance in APAC.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "answer": "In 2022, LIN excluded special charges from its segment-level operating profit, which allowed the APAC segment to reflect a cleaner view of operational performance. In 2021 (vs. 2020), the APAC segment faced a $126 million reduction in operating profit due to the deconsolidation of a joint venture in Taiwan, yet still achieved an 18% increase overall. This sets a strong baseline despite one-time losses. By 2023, the APAC segment reported an 8% increase in operating profit, primarily driven by higher pricing and productivity, despite currency headwinds and cost inflation.

At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",
