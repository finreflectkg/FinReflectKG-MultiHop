      "question": "How does the decline in aircraft manufacturing revenue in 2023, driven by supply chain constraints and fewer large-cabin aircraft deliveries, reconcile with its relatively stable contribution to total aerospace revenue and its proportionate impact compared to aircraft services and G&A expenses?",
      "answer": "In 2023, aircraft manufacturing revenue declined due to supply chain constraints and fewer large-cabin aircraft deliveries, as noted on page 36. Despite this, aircraft manufacturing still contributed $5,710 million to the total aerospace revenue of $8,621 million in 2023 (page 7), indicating it remains a substantial component of the Aerospace segment. When compared to aircraft services and G&A expenses, aircraft manufacturing expenses were only $7 million out of a total increase of $52 million in expenses (page 37), suggesting its cost base is relatively small compared to the broader operational cost structure. This combination of sustained revenue contribution and lower expense growth highlights a potential resilience or strategic importance of the aircraft manufacturing business despite near-term delivery challenges.",

      "answer": "GD reports $9,564 million in customer advances and deposits on its 2023 balance sheet, which includes contract liabilities from long-term contracts. A specific example is the Spanish defense programs, where the Ministry of Industry provided advance payments of $271 million as of December 31, 2023, to fund work before GD incurred related costs. These advances are tied to long-term contracts where GD recognizes revenue over time using incurred costs relative to total estimated costs at completion, meaning the advance payments are gradually recognized as revenue as work progresses and control transfers to the customer.",

This growth aligns with the broader defense segments' total estimated potential contract value of $37.9 billion, up from $35.9 billion in 2022, indicating strong forward-looking revenue visibility across the company. Additionally, the Technologies segment highlighted its own estimated potential contract value of $28 billion as a key indicator of future revenue, suggesting that Gulfstream Dynamics is strategically positioned across multiple defense domains with significant option-driven and IDIQ-based opportunities.

      "question": "How does the decline in intermodal shipments in 2023, driven by high inventories and inflationary pressures, reconcile with the improvements in intermodal car trip plan compliance and the broader impact on freight revenues and network performance?",
      "answer": "Intermodal shipments declined by 3% in 2023 due to high inventories and inflationary pressures affecting consumer demand, despite a domestic contract win (page_28). This decline contributed to a 3% year-over-year decrease in freight revenues, alongside lower fuel surcharge revenues and negative traffic mix, although core pricing gains provided some offset (page_26). Despite this volume decline, intermodal car trip plan compliance improved in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by better network fluidity and faster freight car velocity, indicating that service reliability for intermodal shipments actually improved during the year (page_31). This synthesis shows that while demand for intermodal services weakened, operational execution improved, suggesting potential for future performance gains if demand rebounds.",

This methodology aligns with their accounting policy for performance obligations, where $149 million of outstanding obligations were expected to be recognized in the following quarter in 2023. Despite this structured recognition, freight revenues declined by 3% year-over-year to $22.6 billion, driven by lower fuel surcharge revenues, a negative traffic mix, and a 1% volume decrease. Notably, Mexico-related freight revenues remained relatively stable, contributing $2.8 billion in 2023, compared to $2.7 billion in 2022, indicating that the decline was not attributable to the Mexico segment but rather to broader market dynamics such as weaker intermodal and coal demand.",

      "answer": "Union Pacific repurchased $705 million worth of shares in 2023, a significant decrease from $6,282 million in 2022 and $7,291 million in 2021, aligning with the reduced cash outflows from financing activities in 2023. This reduction supports the company's broader capital allocation strategy, which emphasizes infrastructure hardening, asset replacement, and operational efficiency, as outlined in the 2024 capital plan of $3.4 billion. The decline in share repurchases also correlates with a strategic shift toward maintaining liquidity and investing in long-term growth initiatives.",

        "Hop 2: [UNP](page_35) \u2192 [Share Repurchase Programs]: Notes that the decrease in cash used in financing activities in 2023 was primarily due to reduced share repurchases, indicating a strategic shift in capital deployment.",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's reduced capital expenditure plan for 2024 align with the year-over-year decline in cash used in financing activities, particularly in light of the significant drop in share repurchases and debt issuance compared to previous years?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific's capital plan for 2024 is projected at $3.4 billion, down 8% from 2023, indicating a strategic reduction in investment spending. This aligns with the observed decline in cash used in financing activities, which dropped to $4.625 billion in 2023 from $5.887 billion in 2022. The decrease in financing outflows was primarily driven by a significant drop in share repurchases, which fell to $705 million in 2023 from $6.282 billion in 2022. Additionally, debt issuance was notably lower at $1.599 billion in 2023 compared to $6.080 billion in the prior year. These reductions in financing outflows support the company's strategy to moderate capital spending while maintaining financial flexibility.",

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's allocation of credit facility availability to ME&T compare with its role in derivative transactions and its structural definition as a business segment?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar defines ME&T as the core industrial business excluding Financial Products, responsible for designing, manufacturing, and marketing equipment. As of December 31, 2024, ME&T had access to $2.75 billion of the total $10.50 billion global credit facility, with specific allocations across 364-day, three-year, and five-year facilities. However, ME&T is also party to ISDA master netting agreements, where it engages in derivative transactions with counterparty exposure limited to recorded but unpaid gains. This reveals a dual perspective: ME&T is structurally distinct and conservatively funded relative to Financial Products, yet it remains exposed to derivative-related credit risk, albeit with limited collateral obligations. The combination of structural definition, liquidity allocation, and risk exposure paints a picture of ME&T as a capital-efficient but risk-managed industrial engine within Caterpillar.",

The master netting agreements may also provide for net settlement of all outstanding contracts with a counterparty in the case of an event of default or a termination event. Our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties is limited to only those gains that we have recorded, but for which we have not yet received cash payment.\n\nCollateral is typically not required of the counterparties or of our company under the master netting agreements.

We recognized a net provision for interest and penalties of $35 million, $36 million and $49 million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The total amount of interest and penalties accrued was $190 million and $135 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nOn September 8, 2022, the company reached a settlement with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) that resolves all issues for tax years 2007 through 2016, without any penalties. The company's settlement includes, among other issues, the resolution of disputed tax treatment of profits earned by Caterpillar SARL (CSARL)  from  certain  parts  transactions. We  vigorously  contested  the  IRS's  application  of  the  \"substance-over-form\"  or  \"assignment-of-income\"  judicial doctrines and its proposed increases to tax and imposition of accuracy related penalties. The settlement does not include any increases to tax in the United States based on those judicial doctrines and does not include any penalties. The final tax assessed by the IRS for all issues under the settlement was $490 million for the ten-year period. This amount was primarily paid in 2022 along with associated interest of $250 million. The settlement was within the total amount of gross unrecognized  tax  benefits  for  uncertain  tax   positions  and  enables  us  to  avoid  the  costs  and  burdens  of  further  disputes  with  the  IRS. As  a  result  of  the settlement, we recorded a tax benefit of $41 million in 2022 to reflect changes in estimates of prior years' tax es and related interest, net of tax .\n\nWe are subject to the continuous examination of our U.S. federal income tax returns by the IRS, and tax years 2017 to 2019 are currently under examination. In our major non-U.S. jurisdictions including Australia, Brazil, China, G ermany, India, Japan, Mex ico, Switzerland, Singapore and the U.K., tax  years are typically subject to examination for three to ten years. Due to the uncertainty related to the timing and potential outcome of audits, we cannot estimate the range of reasonably possible change in unrecognized tax benefits in the next 12 months.\n\n## 7.

      "answer": "Caterpillar's deferred tax valuation allowance adjustments impacted their financial reporting differently across sections: In the GAAP-to-adjusted profit reconciliation (page_50), a $106 million tax benefit was shown for 2023, reducing GAAP profit by that amount. In the effective tax rate analysis (page_51), the adjustments were split into $88 million in discrete items and $18 million in annual effective tax rate adjustments for 2023. In the per-share earnings disclosures (page_30), this adjustment was reflected as a $0.21 reduction in profit per share for 2023. The differences reflect how the same underlying tax adjustments are treated in different reporting formats\u2014directly impacting GAAP profit, influencing effective tax rate calculations, and ultimately affecting per-share metrics.",

      "answer": "Caterpillar's Pension/OPEB mark-to-market losses are disclosed as a $154 million pre-tax loss in the profit breakdown (page_50), which flows into a $43 million tax benefit in the effective tax rate section (page_51), ultimately reducing profit by $111 million or $0.23 per share in the adjusted profit reconciliation (page_30). This shows that while the losses directly reduce pre-tax profit, they generate a tax benefit that partially offsets the net impact. The consistent tracking of this item across sections highlights its materiality in both financial performance and tax planning considerations.",

      "answer": "In 2024, Caterpillar's Profit Before Taxes was split between U.S. ($6,219 million) and Non-U.S. ($7,154 million) operations, indicating a growing contribution from international markets. This geographic distribution directly influenced the tax adjustments, as seen in the $224 million impact from tax law changes related to currency translation and a $47 million adjustment from prior year estimates. These tax dynamics contributed to a lower effective tax rate of 19.7% in 2024 compared to 21.3% in 2023. Despite these adjustments, Caterpillar's overall Profit Before Taxes increased slightly to $13,373 million in 2024 from $13,050 million in 2023, aligning with stable profitability metrics despite shifting regional earnings and discrete tax items.",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's revenue recognition policy for freight shipments in progress align with the reported $159 million in outstanding performance obligations and the geographic breakdown of freight revenues, particularly with respect to cross-border shipments to and from Mexico?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific recognizes freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination, with revenue allocated across reporting periods based on relative transit time. This aligns with the $159 million in outstanding performance obligations at the end of 2024, which represents freight moves in progress that will be recognized in the following quarter. Additionally, the company generates a significant portion of its freight revenues from cross-border shipments, with $3.0 billion in 2024 attributed to transportation to and from Mexico. This geographic exposure influences the timing and volume of recognized freight revenues, as international interline services are reported on a net basis and may involve more complex routing and coordination, further tying into the company's revenue recognition methodology for in-progress shipments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nexpected to be collected in one year and the associated allowances are classified as other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n\nInvestments - Inv estments represent our inv estments in affiliated companies (20% to 50% owned) that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and inv estments in companies (less than 20% owned) accounted for at fair v alue when there is a readily determined fair v alue or at cost minus impairment when there are not readily determinable fair v alues. Our portion of income/loss on equity method inv estments that are integral to our operations are recorded in operating expenses. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on inv estments that are not integral to our operations are recorded in other income.\n\nMaterials and Supplies - Materials and supplies are carried at the lower of av erage cost or net realizable v alue.\n\nProperty and Depreciation -  Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis ov er their estimated serv ice liv es, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those lines subject to abandonment, yard tracks, and switching tracks), where liv es are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track. We use the group method of depreciation where all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected liv es are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates. T he group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources, not as singular items. We determine the estimated serv ice liv es of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies. Under the group method of depreciation, no gain or loss is recognized when depreciable property is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business.\n\nImpairment  of  Long-Lived  Assets -  We  rev iew  long-liv ed  assets,  including  identifiable  intangibles,  for  impairment  when  ev ents  or  changes  in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recov erable.  If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying v alue of the long-liv ed assets, the carrying v alue is reduced to the estimated fair v alue.\n\nRevenue Recognition - Freight rev enues are deriv ed from contracts with customers. We account for a contract when it has approv al and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable. Our contracts include priv ate agreements, priv ate rate/letter quotes, public circulars/tariffs, and interline/foreign agreements. The  performance  obligation  in  our  contracts  is  typically  deliv ering  a  specific  commodity  from  a  place  of  origin  to  a  place  of  destination  and  our commitment begins with the tendering and acceptance of a freight bill of lading and is satisfied upon deliv ery at destination. We consider each freight shipment to be a distinct performance obligation.\n\nWe recognize freight rev enues ov er time as freight mov es from origin to destination. T he allocation of rev enues between reporting periods is based on the relativ e  transit  time  in  each  reporting  period  with  expenses  recognized  as  incurred.  Outstanding  performance  obligations  related  to  freight  mov es  in transit totaled $159 million at December 31, 2024, and $149 million at December 31, 2023, and are expected to be recognized in the following quarter as we satisfy our remaining performance obligations and deliv er freight to destination. T he transaction price is generally specified in a contract and may be dependent on the commodity, origin/destination, and route. Customer incentiv es, which are primarily prov ided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes, are recorded as a reduction to operating rev enues.  Customer incentiv es  that  include  v ariable  consideration  based  on cumulativ e  v olumes  are  estimated  using  the  expected  v alue  method,  which  is  based  on  av ailable  historical,  current,  and  forecasted  v olumes,  and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied.\n\nUnder typical payment terms, our customers pay us after each performance obligation is satisfied and there are no material contract assets or liabilities associated with our freight rev enues. Outstanding freight receiv ables are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as accounts receiv able, net.\n\nFreight rev enues related to interline transportation serv ices that inv olv e other railroads are reported on a net basis. T he portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to another party is not reflected as freight rev enues.\n\nOther  rev enues  consist  primarily  of  rev enues  earned  by  our  other  subsidiaries  (primarily  logistics  and  commuter  rail  operations)  and  accessorial rev enues.  Other  subsidiary  rev enues  are  generally  recognized  ov er  time  as  shipments  mov e  from  origin  to  destination.  T he  allocation  of  rev enues between reporting periods is based on the relativ e transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Accessorial rev enues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nTranslation  of  Foreign  Currency -  Our  portion  of  the  assets  and  liabilities  related  to  foreign  inv estments  are  translated  into  U.S.  dollars  at  the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Rev enues and expenses are translated at the av erage",

Nature of Operations\n\nOperations and Segmentation - We are a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. Our network includes 32,880 route miles, connecting Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and Eastern U.S. gateways and prov iding sev eral corridors to key Mexican and Canadian gateways. We own 26,291  miles  and  operate  on  the  remainder  pursuant  to  trackage  rights  or  leases.  We  serv e  the  western  two-thirds  of  the  country  and  maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is mov ed through Gulf Coast, Pacific Coast, and East Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders.\n\nThe  Railroad,  along  with  its  subsidiaries  and  rail  affiliates,  is  our one  reportable  operating  segment. Although  we  prov ide  and  analyze  rev enues  by commodity group, we treat the financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. The accounting policies of the Railroad segment are the same as those described in Note 2 Significant Accounting Policies.\n\nThe  Company's  Chief  Operating  Decision  Maker  (CODM)  is  our  Chief  Executiv e  Officer.  T he  CODM  assesses  performance  for  our  rail  network  and decides how to allocate resources based on net income as reported on our Consolidated Statements of Income. The measure of segment assets is reported on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as total assets.\n\nOur operating rev enues are primarily deriv ed from contracts with customers for the transportation of freight from origin to destination.\n\nAlthough our rev enues are principally deriv ed from customers domiciled in the U.S., the ultimate points of origination or destination for some products we transport are outside the U.S. Freight rev enues from each of our commodity groups, as described in the table below , includes rev enues from shipments to and from Mexico, which amounted to $3.0 billion in 2024, $2.8 billion in 2023, and $2.7 billion in 2022.",

Freight rev enues from bulk shipments decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to lower v olumes and lower fuel surcharge rev enues, partially offset by positiv e mix, from decreased coal shipments, and core pricing gains.  Volumes declined 4% compared to 2023 driv en by reduced use of coal in electricity generationbecause of low natural gas prices, coal fired plant capacity, and mild winter weather, partially offset by strength in export grain to Mexico and several other grain products. Additionally, the v olume declines were partially offset by increased fertilizer shipments due to strong demand and a 2023 customer outage. Volumes for  coal  and  renewables  and  food  and  refrigerated  shipments  were  negativ ely  impacted  by outages  and  serv ice  challenges  due  to  repeated  snow  ev ents  in  Wyoming  and  flooding  in California in the first quarter of 2023 positiv ely impacting the year-ov er-year comparisons.\n\nIndustrial -  Industrial  includes  shipments  of  industrial  chemicals  and  plastics,  metals  and minerals, forest products, and energy and specialized markets. Freight rev enues from industrial shipments increased in 2024v ersus2023due to core pricing gains and positiv e mix of traffic from decreased short haul rock shipments and increased petroleum shipments, partially offset by  lower  fuel  surcharge  rev enues  and  lower  v olumes.Volumes  decreased  1%  compared  to 2023  driv en  by  lower  demand  for  rock,  due  to  weather,  high  inv entories,  and  softness  in Southern markets, and decreased sand shipments due to the use of local sources, partially offset by strength in petroleum, industrial chemicals, and plastics.\n\n## 2024 Bulk Carloads\n\n## 2024 Industrial Carloads\n\nPremium -  Premium  includes  shipments  of  finished  automobiles,  automotiv e  parts,  and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. Freight rev enues from premium shipments increased driv en by higher v olumes and core pricing gains, partially offset by  lower  fuel  surcharge  rev enues  and  negativ e  mix.  Starting  in  the  third  quarter  of  2024, international  intermodal  experienced  heav y  demand  due  to  increased  U.S.  West  Coast imports, a result of freight shifting from the East Coast and Canadian ports due to uncertainty related  to  labor  negotiations,  driv ing  v olumes  up  ov er  30%  in  the  second  half  of  the  year compared to the second half of 2023.  In addition,  business  dev elopment  efforts  in  domestic intermodal  drov e  v olume  growth  in  2024  compared  to  2023. Automotiv e  shipments  were  flat year-ov er-year as business dev elopment wins were offset by market weakness and unplanned production decreases.\n\n## 2024 Premium Carloads\n\nMexico Business - Freight rev enues from each of our commodity groups includes rev enues from shipments to and from Mexico, which amounted to $3.0 billion in 2024, up 8% compared to 2023, driv en by a 3% v olumes increase and a 4% increase in ARC. The v olume increases were driv en by higher grain and grain product shipments and finished v ehicle shipments, partially offset by lower automotiv e parts shipments.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\n",

Freight rev enues v ary with v olumes (carloads) and av erage rev enue  per  car  (ARC).  Changes  in  price,  traffic  mix,  and  fuel  surcharges  driv e ARC.  Customer  incentiv es,  which  are  primarily  prov ided  for  shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulativ e v olumes, are recorded as a reduction to operating rev enues. Customer incentiv es that include v ariable consideration  based  on  cumulativ e  v olumes  are  estimated  using  the  expected  v alue  method,  which  is  based  on  av ailable  historical,  current,  and forecasted v olumes, and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize freight rev enues ov er time as shipments mov e from origin to destination. T he allocation of rev enues between reporting periods is based on the relativ e transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.\n\nOther  subsidiary  rev enues  (primarily  logistics  and  commuter  rail  operations)  are  generally  recognized  ov er  time  as  shipments  mov e  from  origin  to destination. T he allocation of rev enues between reporting periods is based on the relativ e transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Accessorial rev enues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\n\nFreight rev enues increased 1% year-ov er-year to $22.8 billion driv en by a 3% increase in v olumes and core pricing gains, partially offset by lower fuel surcharge rev enues and negativ e mix of traffic (for example, a relativ e increase in international intermodal shipments, which hav e a lower ARC). Volume increaseswere primarily driv en by international intermodal and grain and grain product shipments, partially offset by weaker demand for coal and rock shipments.\n\nOur  fuel  surcharge  programs  generated  freight  rev enues  of  $2.6  billion  and  $3.0billion  in  2024and  2023,  respectiv ely.  Fuel  surcharge  rev enues  in 2024decreased $0.4billion due toa 15% decrease in fuel prices and the lag impact of fluctuating fuel prices (it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharge recov eries), partially offset by higher v olumes.\n\nIn 2024, other subsidiary rev enues decreased compared to 2023primarily driv en by a weaker demand for intermodal shipments at our subsidiary that brokers intermodal and transload logistics serv ices and the partial transfer of our commuter operations to  Metra. Accessorial rev enues decreased in 2024compared to 2023driven by lower intermodal accessorial rev enues because of our intermodal equipment sale, partially offset by a one-time contract settlement.",

      "answer": "UNP's share repurchase programs have significantly decreased in scale from $6,282 million in 2022 to $712 million in 2023 and $1,515 million in 2024, reflecting a more conservative approach to returning capital to shareholders. This trend aligns with the company's emphasis on maintaining a consistent $3.4 billion capital plan focused on infrastructure resilience, locomotive modernization, and growth projects, suggesting a strategic shift toward reinvesting in the business rather than aggressive stock buybacks.",

      "answer": "In 2024, Boeing's Global Services segment generated $19.954 billion in revenue, contributing significantly to the company's total revenue of $66.517 billion. The segment also reported an operating income of $3.618 billion, making it the only segment with positive operating income amid losses in Commercial Airplanes and Defense, Space & Security. However, despite this profitability, the segment's operating income did not offset the company's overall loss from operations, which stood at $10.707 billion, highlighting the segment's strong performance in isolation but limited ability to counterbalance broader company-wide losses.",

      "answer": "The Defense, Space & Security segment shows a decline in operating earnings to $296 million in one view, while its revenue remains high at $23,918 million, indicating a lower operating margin of approximately 3.8% ($296M / $23,918M). This aligns with the segment's operating income of $917 million in another financial presentation, which suggests that differences in accounting treatments or segment classifications\u2014such as unallocated items or eliminations\u2014significantly affect the reported profitability of the segment across different sections of the filing.",

      "answer": "The FAS/CAS service cost adjustment is a key element in Boeing's financial reporting, with distinct treatments across three sections. In segment cost allocation (page 120), it reflects the difference between GAAP pension/postretirement costs and those allocated to government-contracting segments under CAS, emphasizing its role in cost recovery under contractual frameworks. In non-GAAP performance metrics (page 29), the adjustment is excluded from 'Core operating loss,' indicating its non-operational nature and the company\u2019s intent to isolate its impact when assessing operational performance. In the consolidated financial results (page 61), the adjustment appears as a reconciling item in operating loss calculations, with values of $1,104 million in 2024, $1,056 million in 2023, and $1,143 million in 2022, showing its consistent materiality. Together, these perspectives reveal the adjustment as a significant accounting element that bridges GAAP and CAS standards, is strategically excluded from operational KPIs, and directly affects reported profitability.",

      "answer": "Boeing's accounting quantity integrates production delays, cost overruns, and future order expectations into its long-term revenue and margin projections. The 777X certification delays have contributed to a $3,499 million reach-forward loss, as noted in the inventory and cost accounting section, indicating that estimated costs now exceed expected revenues for the program. This loss is directly tied to the accounting quantity, which includes delivered, undelivered, and anticipated future units, and must be reassessed quarterly. The determination of accounting quantity is also constrained by the ability to make dependable estimates, which is complicated by factors such as production disruptions, labor instability, and supply chain issues, as outlined in the management discussion of cost estimation. Additionally, the 777X program's profitability is further influenced by potential adjustments to production rates and contraction of the accounting quantity, which could lead to additional losses. Therefore, the accounting quantity serves as a critical but dynamic metric that reflects both current program challenges and forward-looking demand signals such as firm orders and market studies.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Backlog\n\nOur total backlog represents the estimated transaction prices on unsatisfied and partially satisfied performance obligations to our customers where we believ e it is probable that we will collect the consideration due and where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. Backlog does not include prospectiv e orders where customer-controlled contingencies remain, such as the customer receiv ing approv al from its board of directors, shareholders or gov ernment or completing financing arrangements. All such contingencies must be satisfied or hav e expired prior to recording a new firm order ev en if satisfying such conditions is highly probable. Backlog excludes options and customer financing orders as well as orders where customers have the unilateral right to terminate. A number of our customers may hav e contractual remedies, including rights to reject indiv idual airplane deliv eries  if  the  actual  deliv ery  date  is  significantly  later  than  the  contractual  deliv ery  date.  We  address  customer  claims  and  requests  for  other contractual  relief  as  they  arise.  T he  v alue  of  orders  in  backlog  is  adjusted  as  changes  to  price  and  schedule  are  agreed  to  with  customers  and  is reported in accordance with the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606.\n\nBCA total backlog of $435,175 million at December 31, 2024 decreased from $440,507 million at December 31, 2023, reflecting an increase in the v alue of existing orders that in our assessment do not meet the accounting requirements of ASC 606 for inclusion in backlog, cancellations and decreases in estimated contractual prices, partially offset by new orders in excess of deliv eries. Aircraft order cancellations during the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $11,311 million and primarily related to 737 aircraft. Net ASC 606 adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $16,553 million and primarily related to 777X  aircraft. ASC 606 adjustments include consideration of aircraft orders where a customer-controlled contingency may exist, as well as an assessment of whether the customer is committed to perform, impacts of geopolitical ev ents or related sanctions, or whether it is probable that  the  customer  will  pay  the  full  amount  of  consideration  when  it  is  due.  We  may  experience  reductions  to  backlog  and/or  significant  order cancellations due to v arious factors including deliv ery delays, production disruptions and delays to entry into serv ice of the 777X , 737-7 and/or 737-10.\n\nAccounting  Quantity T he  accounting  quantity  is  our  estimate  of  the  quantity  of  airplanes  that  will  be  produced  for  deliv ery  under  existing  and anticipated contracts. T he determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the rev enue and cost  of  existing  and  anticipated  contracts.  It  is  a  key  determinant  of  the  gross  margins  we  recognize  on  sales  of  indiv idual  airplanes  throughout  a program's life. Estimation of each program's accounting quantity takes into account sev eral factors that are indicativ e of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospectiv e customers and market studies. We rev iew our program accounting quantities quarterly.\n\nThe accounting quantity for each program may include units that hav e been deliv ered, undeliv ered units under contract and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). In dev eloping total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.",

The determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates.\n\nFactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, production rates, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, ov erhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs.  Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account sev eral factors that are indicativ e of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospectiv e customers and market studies. T otal estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undeliv ered units under contract. T he sales prices for all  undeliv ered  units  within  the  accounting  quantity  include  an  escalation  adjustment  for  inflation  that  is  updated  quarterly,  as  well  as  customer consideration driv en by deliv ery delays. Cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends,  and  business  base  and  other  economic  projections.  Factors  that  influence  these  estimates  include  the  timing  of  production  rate  increases, internal  and  supplier  performance  trends,  production  quality,  labor  instability,  supply  chain  delays  and  quality  issues,  learning  curv e,  change incorporation, rework or safety enhancements, regulatory requirements, flight test and certification requirements and schedules, performance or reliability issues inv olv ing  completed aircraft, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends. Certain production rate increases require regulatory approv al. For example, during 2024, the FAA communicated it will not approv e production rate increases for the 737 program beyond 38 per month or additional production lines until Boeing has complied with required quality and safety standards. If we are unable to increase production rates consistent with our assumptions, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted.\n\nThe introduction of new aircraft and deriv ativ es, such as the 777X , 737-7 and 737-10, inv olv es increased risks associated with meeting dev elopment, certification, and production schedules. T hese challenges include significant global regulatory scrutiny of all dev elopment aircraft. We hav e experienced significant  certification  delays  with  the  777X ,  737-7  and  737-10  aircraft. As  a  result,  our  ability  to  deliv er  aircraft  on  time,  satisfy  performance  and reliability standards and achiev e or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. We are following the lead of the FAA as we work through the certification processes for the 777X , 737-7 and 737-10 models and the ultimate timing will be determined by the regulators.\n\nT o  ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  rev iewed  and  updated  on  a  quarterly  basis.  T his  includes reassessing the accounting quantity. Changes in estimates of program gross profit margins are normally recognized on a prospectiv e basis; howev er, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs already included in inv entory exceed estimated rev enues from the program, a loss is recorded in the current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undeliv ered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nThe 777X  and 767 programs recognized earnings charges totaling $3,499 million and $580 million during the year ended December 31, 2024. Adv erse changes to the rev enue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in further earnings charges in future periods. Lower production rates and the IAM 751 work stoppage and new agreement as well as pay enhancements for certain other non-union employees hav e also pressured margins on other commercial airplane programs.\n\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described abov e, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins.

During the year ended December 31, 2024, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 777X  program plus the costs already included in 777X  inv entory exceed estimated rev enues from the program. The resulting reach-forward loss of $3,499 was recorded as a reduction of deferred production costs and other non-recurring costs. The lev el of profitability on the  777X   program  will  be  subject  to  sev eral  factors.  T hese  factors  include  aircraft  certification  requirements  and  timing,  change  incorporation  on completed aircraft, production disruption due to labor instability and supply chain disruption, customer considerations, deliv ery timing and negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X  or other commercial aircraft programs, and contraction of the accounting quantity. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses in future periods.\n\nAt December 31, 2024 and 2023, commercial aircraft programs inv entory included the following amounts related to the 787 program: deferred production costs of $13,178 and $12,384, supplier adv ances of $1,379 and $1,764, and unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs of $1,370 and $1,480. At December 31, 2024, $11,224 of 787 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be recov ered from units included in the program accounting quantity that hav e firm orders, and $3,324 are expected to be recov ered from units included in the program accounting quantity that represent expected future orders. We expensed abnormal production costs of $256, $1,014, and $1,240 during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nCommercial aircraft programs inv entory included amounts credited in cash or other consideration (early issue sales consideration) to airline customers totaling $5,837 and $4,126 at December 31, 2024 and 2023.\n\n## Note 9 - Contracts with Customers\n\nUnbilled receiv ables increased from $8,317 at December 31, 2023, to $8,363 at December 31, 2024, primarily driv en by rev enue recognized in excess of billings at BDS, partially offset by an increase in billings at BGS.\n\nThe following table summarizes our contract assets under long-term contracts that were unbillable or related to outstanding claims as of December 31:\n\n",

      "question": "How do Lockheed Martin's disclosures about profit booking rate adjustments in 2023 reconcile with their accounting policies for contract cost estimation and the financial risks associated with fixed-price development contracts?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's 2023 consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased segment operating profit by $1.6 billion, as disclosed in the financial statements. These adjustments are a result of changes in estimates of total costs to fulfill performance obligations, which are central to their accounting policy for long-term contracts under the cost-to-cost percentage-of-completion method. However, the company also faces significant financial risk from fixed-price development contracts, such as the classified program at Aeronautics with cumulative reach-forward losses of $270 million as of December 31, 2023. These contracts are inherently uncertain due to complex technical challenges and may lead to future losses if estimated completion costs exceed contract values. Thus, while favorable profit adjustments boost current earnings, the exposure from fixed-price contracts introduces volatility and potential future charges that could offset current gains.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of Severance and Other Charges across LMT's income statement, operating cash flow, and segment profit reconciliation reflect its relative financial impact and categorization in different financial reporting contexts?",
      "answer": "Severance and Other Charges appear in three distinct financial contexts: as a direct expense line item in the income statement with amounts of $92M in 2023, $100M in 2022, and $36M in 2021; as a reconciling item in operating cash flow with identical figures added back across the years; and as a negative adjustment in the reconciliation of business segment operating profit to consolidated profit, again showing $92M in 2023, $100M in 2022, and $36M in 2021. This consistent numerical treatment across all three sections indicates that the charges are non-cash, recurring adjustments that are excluded from segment-level profitability metrics but recognized at the consolidated level, suggesting they are strategic or restructuring-related costs that management does not consider part of ongoing segment operations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LMT(page_34) \u2192 Severance and Other Charges: Discloses the charges as a standalone expense line item within total cost of sales, showing $92M in 2023, $100M in 2022, and $36M in 2021.",
        "Hop 2: LMT(page_59) \u2192 Severance and Other Charges: Reports the same charges as a positive reconciling item in operating cash flow, indicating that these are non-cash expenses added back to net earnings.",
        "Hop 3: LMT(page_71) \u2192 Severance and Other Charges: Reflects the charges as a negative adjustment in the reconciliation of segment operating profit to consolidated profit, again with identical amounts of $92M, $100M, and $36M for 2023, 2022, and 2021 respectively."

      "question": "How does Lockheed Martin's treatment of pre-contract costs in inventory, as seen in both their accounting policy and year-end balances, relate to the risk of reach-forward losses on classified and complex development programs, particularly in the Aeronautics segment?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin capitalizes pre-contract costs in inventory when they are directly tied to a probable contract and expected to be recoverable, as noted in their accounting policy. By the end of 2023, $989 million in pre-contract costs were included in inventories, primarily driven by the Aeronautics segment. These costs are often incurred to meet schedule and milestone requirements on programs such as a classified fixed-price incentive fee contract, which has already resulted in cumulative reach-forward losses of $270 million. The company monitors the recoverability of these pre-contract costs, which could be negatively impacted by customer decisions on future program phases. Thus, the capitalization of pre-contract costs is closely tied to the ongoing risk of losses on complex, fixed-price contracts, especially in the Aeronautics business, where both cost overruns and schedule changes can threaten recoverability and financial performance.",

      "answer": "The FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment contributed $1.66 billion to Lockheed Martin\u2019s consolidated earnings in 2023, as shown in the reconciliation of unallocated items. This adjustment arises from the difference between CAS pension costs (used in segment reporting) and the service cost component of FAS pension income (used in consolidated GAAP reporting). In segment results, pension expense is based on CAS, which is recoverable through U.S. Government contracts and included in net sales and cost of sales. The adjustment ensures alignment with GAAP by recognizing the difference between these two measures in consolidated results. Additionally, the broader 'Other Unallocated, Net' category reduced cost of sales by $1.2 billion in 2023, which includes the FAS/CAS pension adjustment along with other corporate-level adjustments like stock-based compensation and deferred compensation plan fair value changes. This shows that the FAS/CAS pension adjustment is a significant component of the company\u2019s consolidated earnings structure, reflecting its unique treatment in both segment and consolidated financial reporting.",

      "question": "How do Lockheed Martin's disclosures on profit booking rate adjustments reconcile the impact of specific contract losses, such as the $225 million loss on a classified Aeronautics program, with the overall methodology for recognizing revenue over time and the audit complexities tied to estimating profit booking rates?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's disclosures indicate that profit booking rate adjustments are a key mechanism for recognizing changes in contract profitability, particularly under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. The $225 million loss on a classified Aeronautics program (page_79) exemplifies how deteriorating contract conditions can lead to downward adjustments in profit booking rates, directly impacting segment operating profit. This aligns with the methodology described on page_59, where profit booking rates are revised based on updated estimates of total costs to complete a contract, with increases or decreases recognized in the period they are determined. The audit complexities outlined on page_69 further underscore the judgment required in estimating profit booking rates, especially given the sensitivity of assumptions around technical, schedule, and cost risks. Together, these sections show that while the company has a structured approach to recognizing revenue and adjusting profit rates, the process is inherently uncertain and subject to material revisions, particularly when contracts face performance issues.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\nOur  consolidated  net  adjustments  not  related  to  volume,  including  net  profit  booking  rate  adjustments  and  other  items, increased segment operating profit by approximately $2.0 billion in 2021, $1.8 billion in 2020 and $1.9 billion in 2019. These adjustments increased net earnings by approximately $1.6 billion ($5.81 per share) in 2021 and $1.5 billion ($5.33 and $5.29 per share)  in  2020  and  2019.  We  recognized  net  sales  from  performance  obligations  satisfied  in  prior  periods  of  approximately $2.2 billion, $2.0 billion and $2.2 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, which primarily relate to changes in profit booking rates that impacted revenue.\n\nWe have  experienced  performance  issues  on  a  classified  fixed-price  incentive  fee  contract  that  involves  highly  complex design  and  systems  integration  at  our  Aeronautics  business  segment.  During  the  second  quarter  of  2021,  we  completed  a comprehensive  review  and  negotiation  of  scope  of  the  program  with  our  customer,  including  the  technical  requirements, performance to date, remaining work, schedule, and estimated costs to complete the program. At the conclusion of the review, we determined that the total costs to complete the current phase of the program would exceed the contract price. Accordingly, during the second quarter of 2021, we recognized a loss of $225 million ($169 million, or $0.61 per share, after tax) on the program at our Aeronautics business segment, which represented our estimated total losses on the current phase of the program. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we amended the contract with our customer to modify the contract scope and price. The terms of the amendment are  consistent  with  the  assumptions  used  to  estimate  the  loss  recognized  in  the  second  quarter  of  2021.  Therefore,  our  current estimated loss remains at $225 million. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth, which could be material to our operating results. In addition, we and our industry team will incur advanced procurement costs (also referred to as precontract costs) in order to enhance our ability to achieve the revised schedule  and  certain  milestones.  We  will  monitor  the  recoverability  of  precontract  costs,  which  could  be  impacted  by  the customer's decision regarding future phases of the program.\n\nWe are responsible for a program to design, develop and construct a ground-based radar at our RMS business segment. The program has experienced performance issues for which we have periodically accrued reserves. Cumulative losses on this program were approximately $280 million as of December 31, 2021. We will continue to monitor our performance, any future changes in scope, and estimated costs to complete the program and may have to record additional losses in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth. However, based on the losses previously recorded and our current estimate of the sales and costs to complete the program, at this time we do not anticipate that additional losses, if any, would be material to our operating results or financial condition.\n\nWe have a program, EADGE-T, to design, integrate and install an air missile defense command, control, communications, computers - intelligence (C4I) system for an international customer that has experienced performance issues and for which we have periodically accrued reserves at our RMS business segment. We last recorded a charge and accrued reserves for this program in 2017. As  of  December  31,  2021,  cumulative  losses  remained  at  approximately  $260  million.  We  continue  to  monitor  program requirements and our performance. At this time, we do not anticipate additional charges that would be material to our operating results or financial condition.",

Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporation's revenue is recognized  over  time  using  the  percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress.  Under  the percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress,  the  Corporation  measures  progress  towards completion  based  on  the  ratio  of  costs  incurred  to  date  to  the  estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the performance  obligation(s)  (referred  to  as  the  estimate-at-completion  analysis).  The  Corporation  estimates profit  on  these  contracts  as  the  difference  between  total  estimated  revenues  and  total  estimated  cost  at completion.\n\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of  those  risks  on  its  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract.  Profit  booking  rates  may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical,  schedule  and  cost  aspects  of  the  contract,  which  would  decrease  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  Conversely,  the  profit  booking  rates  may  decrease  if  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporation's results of operations.\n\nAuditing  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses  used  in  its  revenue  recognition  process  was complex  due  to  the  judgment  involved  in  evaluating  the  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by management in the creation and subsequent updates to the Corporation's estimate-at-completion analyses. The estimate-at-completion analyses of each contract consider risks surrounding the Corporation's ability to achieve the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  relevant internal  controls  over  the  Corporation's  revenue  recognition  process.  For  example,  we  tested  internal controls over management's review of the estimate-at-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying  the  estimated  contract  value  and  estimated  total  costs  to  complete.  We  also  tested  internal controls  that  management  executes  to  validate  the  data  used  in  the  estimate-at-completion  analyses  was complete and accurate.\n\nTo test  the  accuracy  of  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses,  our  audit  procedures  included, among others, comparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the key terms to contract documentation and management's estimates. We also  performed  sensitivity  analyses  over  the  significant  assumptions  to  evaluate  the  change  in  the  profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plan Obligation\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Corporation's aggregate obligation for its qualified defined benefit pension plans was $43.5 billion and exceeded the gross fair value of the related plan assets of $35.2 billion, resulting in a net  unfunded qualified defined benefit pension obligation of $8.3 billion. As explained in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension assets and  obligations  at  the  end  of  each  year  or  more  frequently  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate and participant longevity.\n\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as discount rate and participant longevity, used  in  the  measurement  process.  These  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  projected  benefit obligation, with the discount rate being the most sensitive of those assumptions.",

      "answer": "The $1.3 billion noncash pension settlement charge, which was part of the $1.8 billion total pension expense recognized in 2021, contributed to the overall FAS pension expense of $1,398 million reported in the financial tables. This negative FAS pension income contrasts with the CAS pension cost of $2,066 million, resulting in a net FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $668 million. The adjustment reflects the difference between FAS accounting rules, which recognize actuarial gains and losses over time, and CAS requirements, which allow for more immediate cost recovery in government contracts.

We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate  the  approximate  average  yields  on  corporate  bonds  rated AA  or  better  selected  to  match  our  projected  postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $2.3 billion at December 31, 2021.\n\nWe  utilized  an  expected  long-term  rate  of  return  on  plan  assets  of  6.50%  at  December  31,  2021  compared  to  7.00%  at December 31, 2020. We lowered our expected long-term rate of return on plan assets due to changes in our asset allocation targets. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption we select and the actual return on plan assets in any given year affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance each year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2021 of $3.9 billion, based on an actual rate of approximately  10.5%,  improved  plan  assets  more  than  the  $2.1  billion  expected  return  based  on  our  long-term  rate  of  return assumption.\n\nIn October 2021, the Society of Actuaries published revised longevity assumptions that refined its prior studies. We used the revised  assumptions  in  our  December  31,  2021  re-measurement  of  benefit  obligation  resulting  in  an  approximate  $109  million increase in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans.\n\nOur stockholders' equity has been reduced cumulatively by $11.0 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative noncash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from declines in discount rates, investment losses and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three-year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized  to  the  extent  they  exceed  10%  of  the  greater  of  plan  assets  or  benefit  obligations,  over  an  average  period  of approximately twenty years as of December 31, 2021. During 2021, $1.8 billion of these amounts were recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plans expense inclusive of the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.3 billion.\n\nThe discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 2.875% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2021, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2021 by approximately $1.5 billion, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders' equity at the end of the year of approximately $1.2 billion. If the 2.875% discount rate at December 31, 2021 that was used to compute the expected 2022 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2022 would be lower or higher by approximately $10 million. If the 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2021 that was used to compute the expected 2022 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis  points  higher  or  lower,  with  all  other  assumptions  held  constant,  the  amount  of  FAS  pension  expense  projected  for  2022 would be lower or higher by approximately $75 million. Each year, differences between the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year's FAS expense. Every 100 basis points increase (decrease) in return during 2021 between our actual rate of return of approximately 10.5% and our expected long-term rate of return decreased (increased) 2022 expected FAS pension expense by approximately $15 million.\n\n## Funding Considerations\n\nWe made no contributions in 2021, compared to $1.0 billion in 2020, to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in a manner consistent with CAS and in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, along with consideration of CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. Our goal has been to fund the pension plans to a level of at least 80%, as determined in accordance with ERISA. The ERISA funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans was approximately 92% and 82% as of",

      "question": "How does Lockheed Martin's treatment of profit booking rate adjustments on long-term contracts, as seen in its revenue recognition methodology, audit considerations, and segment performance impacts, reflect the interplay between accounting estimates, risk management, and financial reporting volatility?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin adjusts profit booking rates on long-term contracts based on evolving estimates of contract sales and costs, which are initially set considering risks around technical, schedule, and cost performance. These estimates are reviewed throughout the contract lifecycle and can lead to increases or decreases in the profit booking rate depending on whether risks are retired or escalate. The audit process confirms the complexity of validating these estimates, including labor, subcontractor, and material costs, and how changes in assumptions can materially affect results. Segment operating profit and margin are directly impacted by these adjustments, with risk retirements increasing profitability and cost overruns reducing it, often with inception-to-date effects recognized in the current period. This dynamic shows how accounting estimates, risk management, and financial reporting volatility are tightly interwoven in Lockheed Martin\u2019s financial statements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nFor performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.\n\nFor performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.\n\nBacklog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and  services  for  which  control  has  not  yet  transferred  to  the  customer.  It  is  converted  into  sales  in  future  periods  as  work  is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-reimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts  are  successfully  retired,  the  estimated  consideration  from  customers  may  be  reduced,  resulting  in  a  reduction  of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales. As of December 31, 2021, our ending backlog was $135.4 billion. We expect to  recognize  approximately  38%  of  our  backlog  over  the  next  12  months  and  approximately  60%  over  the  next  24  months  as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\n\nFor arrangements with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the  contract  type. Typical  payment  terms  under  fixed-price  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government  provide  that  the  customer  pays either  performance-based  payments  (PBPs)  based  on  the  achievement  of  contract  milestones  or  progress  payments  based  on  a percentage of costs we incur. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented  as  a  contract  liability  on  the  balance  sheet.  The  portion  of  payments  retained  by  the  customer  until  final  contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligations under the contract. Payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.\n\nFor fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales and costs, including the profit booking rate. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the  contract,  as  well  as  variable  consideration,  and  assess  the  effects  of  those  risks  on  our  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  The  estimates  consider  the  technical  requirements  (e.g.,  a  newly-developed  product  versus  a  mature product),  the  schedule  and  associated  tasks  (e.g.,  the  number  and  type  of  milestone  events)  and  costs  (e.g.,  material,  labor, subcontractor,  overhead,  general  and  administrative  and  the  estimated  costs  to  fulfill  our  industrial  cooperation  agreements, sometimes  referred  to  as  offset  or  localization  agreements,  required  under  certain  contracts  with  international  customers).  The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks surrounding the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract  or  may  increase  the  variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  on  the  contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable  consideration  we  expect  to  receive  decrease. All  of  the  estimates  are  subject  to  change  during  the  performance  of  the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.",

As more fully described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation generates the majority of its net sales from long-term contracts with its customers whereby substantially all of the Corporation's revenue is recognized  over  time  using  the  percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress.  Under  the percentage-of-completion  cost-to-cost  measure  of  progress,  the  Corporation  measures  progress  towards completion  based  on  the  ratio  of  costs  incurred  to  date  to  the  estimated  total  costs  to  complete  the performance  obligation(s)  (referred  to  as  the  estimate-at-completion  analysis).  The  Corporation  estimates profit  on  these  contracts  as  the  difference  between  total  estimated  revenues  and  total  estimated  cost  at completion.\n\nThe percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions to estimate contract sales and costs associated with its contracts with customers. At the outset of a long-term contract, the Corporation identifies risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract. Throughout the contract life cycle, the Corporation monitors and assesses the effects of  those  risks  on  its  estimates  of  sales  and  total  costs  to  complete  the  contract.  Profit  booking  rates  may increase during the performance of the contract if the Corporation successfully retires risks surrounding the technical,  schedule  and  cost  aspects  of  the  contract,  which  would  decrease  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete  the  contract.  Conversely,  the  profit  booking  rates  may  decrease  if  the  estimated  total  costs  to complete the contract increase. Changes to the profit booking rates resulting from changes in estimates could have a material effect on the Corporation's results of operations.\n\nAuditing  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses  used  in  its  revenue  recognition  process  was complex  due  to  the  judgment  involved  in  evaluating  the  significant  estimates  and  assumptions  made  by management in the creation and subsequent updates to the Corporation's estimate-at-completion analyses. The estimate-at-completion analyses of each contract consider risks surrounding the Corporation's ability to achieve the technical, schedule, and cost aspects of the contract.\n\nWe  obtained  an  understanding,  evaluated  the  design  and  tested  the  operating  effectiveness  of  relevant internal  controls  over  the  Corporation's  revenue  recognition  process.  For  example,  we  tested  internal controls over management's review of the estimate-at-completion analyses and the significant assumptions underlying  the  estimated  contract  value  and  estimated  total  costs  to  complete.  We  also  tested  internal controls  that  management  executes  to  validate  the  data  used  in  the  estimate-at-completion  analyses  was complete and accurate.\n\nTo test  the  accuracy  of  the  Corporation's  estimate-at-completion  analyses,  our  audit  procedures  included, among others, comparing estimates of labor costs, subcontractor costs, and materials to historical results of similar contracts, and agreeing the key terms to contract documentation and management's estimates. We also  performed  sensitivity  analyses  over  the  significant  assumptions  to  evaluate  the  change  in  the  profit booking rates resulting from changes in the assumptions.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension Plan Obligation\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the Corporation's aggregate obligation for its qualified defined benefit pension plans was $43.5 billion and exceeded the gross fair value of the related plan assets of $35.2 billion, resulting in a net  unfunded qualified defined benefit pension obligation of $8.3 billion. As explained in Note 12 of the consolidated financial statements, the Corporation remeasures the qualified defined benefit pension assets and  obligations  at  the  end  of  each  year  or  more  frequently  upon  the  occurrence  of  certain  events.  The amounts are measured using actuarial valuations, which depend on key assumptions such as the discount rate and participant longevity.\n\nAuditing the defined benefit pension obligation was complex and required the involvement of specialists as a result of the judgmental nature of the actuarial assumptions such as discount rate and participant longevity, used  in  the  measurement  process.  These  assumptions  have  a  significant  effect  on  the  projected  benefit obligation, with the discount rate being the most sensitive of those assumptions.",

When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nComparability of our segment sales, operating  profit  and  operating  margin  may  be  impacted  favorably  or  unfavorably  by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts for which we recognize revenue over time using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost  method  to  measure  progress  towards  completion.  Increases  in  the  profit  booking  rates,  typically  referred  to  as  risk retirements,  usually  relate  to  revisions  in  the  estimated  total  costs  to  fulfill  the  performance  obligations  that  reflect  improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring charges, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters; restructuring  charges,  except  for  significant  severance  actions,  which  are  excluded  from  segment  operating  results;  reserves  for disputes; certain asset impairments; and losses on sales of certain assets.\n\n## Other Contract Accounting Considerations\n\nThe majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are  allowable  in  establishing  prices  for  goods  and  services  under  U.S.  Government  contracts.  For  example,  costs  such  as  those related  to  charitable  contributions,  interest  expense  and  certain  advertising  and  public  relations  activities  are  unallowable  and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.\n\nWe  closely  monitor  compliance  with  and  the  consistent  application  of  our  critical  accounting  policies  related  to  contract accounting.  Costs  incurred  and  allocated  to  contracts  are  reviewed  for  compliance  with  U.S.  Government  regulations  by  our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.",

      "answer": "Lockheed Martin recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion in 2021 due to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses after transferring $4.9 billion in pension obligations via group annuity contracts (GACs), which aligns with its ongoing pension risk transfer strategy aimed at reducing volatility in pension obligations. While this charge affected GAAP earnings by accelerating the recognition of previously deferred actuarial losses included in accumulated other comprehensive loss (AOCL), it did not significantly impact CAS pension cost or the net FAS/CAS pension adjustment for U.S. Government contracts.

The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan's assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in an enhanced defined contribution retirement savings plan.\n\nSimilar to recent years, we continue to take actions to mitigate the effect of our defined benefit pension plans on our financial results by reducing the volatility of our pension obligations, including entering into pension risk transfer transactions involving the purchase of group annuity contracts (GACs) for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. On August 3, 2021, we purchased GACs to transfer $4.9 billion of gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company for approximately 18,000 U.S. retirees and beneficiaries. The GACs were purchased using  assets  from  Lockheed  Martin's  master  retirement  trust  and  no  additional  funding  contribution  was  required  by  us.  This transaction had no impact on the amount, timing, or form of the monthly retirement benefit payments to the affected retirees and beneficiaries. In connection with this transaction, we recognized a noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion ($1.3 billion, or $4.72 per share, after tax) for the affected defined benefit pension plans during the third quarter of 2021, which represents the accelerated  recognition  of  actuarial  losses  that  were  included  in  the  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss  account  within stockholders' equity. As a result of this transaction, we were required to remeasure the benefit obligations and plan assets for the affected  defined  benefit  pension  plans  as  of  the  August  3,  2021  close  date.  The  purchase  of  the  GACs  and  the  pension remeasurement did not have an impact on our CAS pension cost and did not significantly impact our total FAS pension expense or net FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2021, except for the noncash pension settlement charge.\n\nInclusive of the transaction described above, since December 2018, Lockheed Martin, through its master retirement trust, has purchased total contracts for approximately $11.6 billion related to our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations eliminating pension  plan  volatility  for  approximately  95,000  retirees  and  beneficiaries  and  annually  required  Pension  Benefit  Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums of approximately $69 million per year.\n\nWe expect  to  continue  to  look  for  opportunities  to  manage  our  pension  liabilities  through  additional  pension  risk  transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.\n\nNotwithstanding  these  actions,  the  impact  of  our  postretirement  benefit  plans  on  our  earnings  may  be  volatile  in  that  the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to funding levels as well as changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity and employee turnover, as well as the timing of cash funding.\n\n## Actuarial Assumptions\n\nThe benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, participant longevity, and employee turnover.  The  assumptions  we  make  affect  both  the  calculation  of  the  benefit  obligations  as  of  the  measurement  date  and  the calculation  of  FAS  expense  in  subsequent  periods.  When  reassessing  these  assumptions,  we  consider  past  and  current  market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.\n\nWe continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 2.875% at December 31, 2021, compared to 2.50% at December 31, 2020. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 2.75% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our",

CAS govern the extent to which our  pension  costs  are  allocable  to  and  recoverable  under  contracts  with  the  U.S.  Government,  including  FMS.  Pension  cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with ERISA.\n\nWe recovered $2.1 billion in 2021 and $2.0 billion in 2020 as CAS pension costs. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension  costs  recovered  under  U.S.  Government  contracts  are  considered  to  be  prepayment  credits  under  the  CAS  rules.  Our prepayment credits were approximately $7.0 billion and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.\n\nOn March 11, 2021, the President signed the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 into law, which eased funding requirements for  single-employer  defined  benefit  pension  plans  under  ERISA,  as  amended,  by  restarting  and  extending  the  amortization  of funding shortfalls and extending and enhancing interest rate stabilization percentages, among many other stimulus measures. These changes have the effect of lowering our minimum funding requirements and CAS pension costs from what they otherwise would have been had the measures not been enacted.\n\n## Trends\n\nWe  do  not  plan  to  make  contributions  to  our  qualified  defined  benefit  pension  plans  in  2022.  We  anticipate  recovering approximately $1.8 billion of CAS pension cost in 2022 allowing us to recoup a portion of our CAS prepayment credits.\n\nWe project FAS pension income of $460 million in 2022 compared to FAS pension income of $265 million in 2021 and a net 2022 FAS/CAS pension benefit of $2.3 billion, which is comparable to the $2.3 billion in 2021. This excludes the noncash pension settlement charge of $1.7 billion (pretax) recognized in the third quarter of 2021 described above for comparison year over year.\n\n## Environmental Matters\n\nWe are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the total amount of liabilities recorded on our consolidated balance sheet for environmental matters was $742 million and $789 million. We have recorded assets totaling $645 million and $685 million at December 31, 2021 and 2020 for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery in pricing of our products and services for agencies of the U.S. Government, as discussed below.  The  amount  that  is  expected  to  be  allocated  to  our  non-U.S.  Government  contracts  or  that  is  determined  to  not  be recoverable  under  U.S.  Government  contracts  is  expensed  through  cost  of  sales.  We  project  costs  and  recovery  of  costs  over approximately 20 years.\n\nWe enter into agreements (e.g. , administrative consent orders, consent decrees) that document the extent and timing of some of our  environmental  remediation  obligations.  We  also  are  involved  in  environmental  remediation  activities  at  sites  where  formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually  span  many  years,  which  makes  estimating  the  costs  more  judgmental  due  to,  for  example,  changing  remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation, and evolving environmental standards.\n\nWe perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable  that  the  liabilities  have  been  incurred  and  the  amounts  can  be  reasonably  estimated  (see  the  discussion  under 'Environmental  Matters'  in  'Note  1  -  Organization  and  Significant Accounting  Policies'  and  'Note  15  -  Legal  Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies' included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g. , a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).",

Despite the drop in C5ISR revenue, the Technologies segment maintained revenue near $12.5B in 2021 and projected $12.8\u201313B for 2022, supported by IT services growth. Meanwhile, consolidated revenue growth came primarily from the Marine Systems segment\u2019s Navy ship construction, with lower C5ISR revenue being partially offset by increased IT services and international vehicle revenue in other segments.

Increased public  awareness  and  concern  regarding  global  climate  change  may  result  in  state,  federal  or  international requirements to reduce or mitigate global warming, such as the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms or stricter limits on greenhouse gas emissions. If environmental or climate-change laws or regulations are adopted or  changed  that  impose  significant  new  costs,  operational  restrictions  or  compliance  requirements  upon  our business or our products, they could increase our capital expenditures, reduce our margins and adversely affect our financial position.\n\n## FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n\nThis  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  contains  forward-looking  statements  that  are  based  on  management's expectations, estimates, projections and  assumptions.

      "question": "How does the treatment of long-term contract cost estimation risks in the defense segments reconcile with the segment's contract billing practices and the reported backlog value as of December 31, 2021?",
      "answer": "The defense segments face significant estimation risks in determining the costs at completion for long-term contracts, which directly affect revenue recognition timing and amounts. These risks are managed through detailed internal controls and auditor scrutiny due to the high degree of subjectivity involved, especially around assumptions like labor hours and material costs. Simultaneously, the defense segments bill customers periodically or upon milestone achievement, often after revenue has been recognized, leading to contract assets. This billing pattern introduces timing differences between revenue recognition and cash flow, which must be carefully managed alongside cost estimation uncertainties. As of December 31, 2021, the defense segments reported a total backlog value that includes both funded and unfunded portions of firm contracts, with the unfunded portion relying on future appropriations. This underscores the dual challenge of managing long-term cost estimation risks while maintaining visibility into future revenue through evolving contract balances and uncertain funding commitments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Estimation of costs at completion for select long-term contracts\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  B  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements,  accounting  for  long-term  contracts involves estimation of the costs to complete a contract in order to accurately recognize the associated revenue.  The  estimated  costs  at  completion  for  each  contract  are  used  to  assess  the  proportion  of revenues to recognize based upon the costs incurred-to-date in comparison to the total estimate of costs to complete the contract.\n\nWe identified the assessment of the estimation of costs at completion for a select group of long-term contracts in the defense segments as a critical audit matter. The estimated costs at completion for the select  group  of  long-term  contracts  incorporates  assumptions,  such  as  labor  hours  and  the  cost  of materials for the work to be performed. The evaluation of one or more of the assumptions used in the estimation of the costs to complete for the select group of contracts required a high level of subjective auditor judgment due to the nature of the individual contracts and related contract performance risks. Specifically,  changes  to  certain  assumptions  may  have  a  significant  impact  on  the  estimated  revenue recorded during the period.\n\nThe following are primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls related to the estimation of costs at completion for the select group of long-term contracts. This included contract level controls over the estimated cost assumptions. For certain contracts, we compared the Company's historical estimates of  costs  to  actual  costs  incurred  to  assess  the  Company's  ability  to  estimate  accurately.  Based  on  the nature  of  the  individual  contract,  we  evaluated  certain  assumptions  within  the  Company's  estimated costs at completion by:\n\n- -reading the underlying contract and any related amendments to obtain an understanding of the contractual requirements and related performance obligations\n- -assessing  costs  incurred  to-date  and  the  relative  progress  toward  satisfying  the  performance obligation(s) of the contract\n- -assessing, if relevant, the estimated costs at completion on similar or predecessor contracts and programs\n- -inquiring of financial and operational personnel of the Company to identify factors that should be considered within the estimated costs at completion or indications of potential management bias\n- -inspecting correspondence, if any, between the Company and the customer regarding actual todate and expected performance\n- -analyzing the sufficiency of the Company's assessment of contract performance risks included within the estimated costs at completion.\n\n## Discount rates used in pension benefit obligation\n\nAs  discussed  in  Note  S  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements, t he  Company's  pension  benefit obligation and the associated plan assets were $17.8 billion and $15.2 billion, respectively, on December 31, 2021. These balances resulted in a net liability of $2.6 billion. The pension benefit obligation is the estimated  present  value  of  future  pension  benefits  attributed  to  employee  services  rendered  to  date, including assumptions about future compensation levels.

      "question": "How does GE's Aerospace segment's capital investment and tangible asset base compare to its current receivables and intangible assets, and what does this indicate about its financial positioning and operational focus?",
      "answer": "GE's Aerospace segment reported tangible assets (property, plant, and equipment net book value) of $39,985 million as of December 31, 2023, with $734 million in additions and $1,089 million in depreciation during 2023. This indicates a substantial capital-intensive asset base. In contrast, the segment's current receivables stood at $8,010 million, reflecting a significant amount of short-term credit exposure or sales activity. Meanwhile, the segment's intangible assets, net of impairments, were $4,518 million as of year-end 2023. The relatively smaller base of intangible assets compared to tangible assets suggests that the Aerospace segment is more execution- and asset-driven rather than relying heavily on brand, IP, or acquired goodwill. The high tangible asset base relative to receivables and intangibles implies a continued emphasis on physical infrastructure and long-term capital deployment, aligning with the nature of aerospace manufacturing and services.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GE(page_80) \u2192 Aerospace Revenue: The segment's tangible asset base is substantial at $39,985 million, with significant additions and depreciation figures indicating capital intensity.",
        "Hop 2: GE(page_56) \u2192 Aerospace Revenue: The segment holds $4,518 million in intangible assets, which is modest compared to its tangible asset base, suggesting less reliance on brand or intellectual property.",
        "Hop 3: GE(page_54) \u2192 Aerospace Revenue: Aerospace current receivables totaled $8,010 million, indicating a meaningful but proportionally smaller portion of the segment's financial exposure compared to its long-term asset base."

      "answer": "The Principal Pension Plans are reported as a deferred tax asset of $1,359 million in the 2023 financial statements, indicating their current tax-effected value. This aligns with the restructuring described in the postretirement benefit plans note, where a portion of the Principal Pension Plans was transferred to GE Healthcare as part of the $4.2 billion in net postretirement liabilities reallocated during the separation. Meanwhile, the pension plan governance section reveals that the plans have a de-risking investment strategy involving long-dated corporate bonds, treasuries, and derivatives, with GE securities making up only 0.5% of assets in 2023, suggesting a deliberate move to reduce company-specific exposure following the restructuring.",

      "question": "How does the increase in GE's progress collections from 2022 to 2023 across business segments align with the company's revenue recognition policies and the tax implications of these collections as deferred tax assets?",
      "answer": "GE's progress collections increased from $15,655 million in 2022 to $19,106 million in 2023 across its Aerospace, Renewable Energy, and Power segments, reflecting stronger advance payments from customers for large equipment purchases. This aligns with GE's revenue recognition policy where progress collections are not considered a significant financing component but are used to reserve production slots, and revenue is recognized over time as performance obligations are satisfied. These collections contributed to the increase in deferred tax assets related to progress collections, contract assets, and deferred items, which rose from $2,365 million in 2022 to $2,753 million in 2023, indicating the tax impact of these upfront collections and the associated timing differences in revenue recognition.",

      "answer": "The GE Aerospace Pension Plan shows a 10-year annualized return of 4.6%, a funding deficit of $2,184 million as of December 31, 2023, and covers approximately 115,400 retirees and beneficiaries, 47,500 vested former employees, and 15,700 active employees. The plan is closed to new participants since 2012, and benefits for employees with salaried benefits were frozen in 2021, with increased contributions to a defined contribution plan instead. Despite generating positive returns over multiple time horizons, the plan remains significantly underfunded, highlighting a strategic shift away from defined benefit plans toward defined contribution structures for newer employees.",

      "answer": "FedEx faces significant exposure from vehicle accidents, which are explicitly mentioned as part of its legal contingencies (page_73), where management must assess whether a liability is probable and reasonably estimable. These liabilities are also a core component of the company's self-insurance accruals, which totaled $5.6 billion at May 31, 2024 (page_78), and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims. The company uses actuarial methods and management judgment to determine these accruals (page_70), which are then independently validated during the audit process through testing and comparison to actuarial ranges (page_78). This multi-layered approach reflects a structured but inherently uncertain estimation process for vehicle accident-related liabilities across legal, financial, and audit domains.",

          "chunk_text": "| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit   | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's process for estimating the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans, including management's review of the significant assumptions and assessment of the data inputs provided to the actuary. To test the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the methodologies used, the significant actuarial assumptions described above, and the underlying data used by the Company. We compared the actuarial assumptions used by management to historical trends and evaluated the change in the projected benefit obligation of the U.S. pension plans from the prior year due to the change in service cost, interest cost, actuarial gains, and benefit payments. In addition, we involved our actuarial specialists to assist in evaluating management's methodology for determining the discount rate. As part of this assessment, we compared management's selected discount rate to an independently developed range of reasonable discount rates. Additionally, we compared the projected future cash flows of the U.S. pension plans to the prior year projections and compared the current year benefits paid to the prior year projected cash flows. We also tested the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data, including the participant data provided to management's actuarial specialists.   |\n|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n|                                            | Valuation of Self-Insurance Accruals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| Description of the Matter                  | At May 31, 2024, the Company's self-insurance accruals reflected in the balance sheet were $5.6 billion. As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, self- insurance accruals include costs associated with workers' compensation claims, vehicle accidents, property and cargo loss, general business liabilities, and benefits paid under employee disability programs. These accrued liabilities are primarily based on the actuarially estimated cost of claims, including incurred-but-not-reported (IBNR) claims. Auditing the Company's self-insurance accruals is complex due to the significant measurement uncertainty inherent to the estimate, the application of management judgment, and the use of various actuarial methods. In addition, the accruals are sensitive due to                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit   | We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over management's process for estimating self-insurance accruals, including management's review of the significant assumptions used, results of calculations and assessment of data underlying the accruals. To evaluate the self-insurance accruals, our audit procedures included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying claims data used by the Company. We involved our actuarial specialists to assist in our evaluation of the methodologies applied by management in establishing the actuarially determined accrual and in reviewing the Company's reinsurance contracts by policy year to assess the Company's self-insured retentions, deductibles, and coverage limits. We compared the Company's accrued amounts to a range developed by our actuarial specialists. Furthermore, we compared the Company's historical estimates of expected incurred losses to actual losses experienced during the current year.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n",

      "question": "Analyze FedEx's long-term funding outlook for postretirement healthcare obligations, considering the HRA-based benefit structure, the 2018 eligibility restrictions, and the projected annual payments through 2034.",
      "answer": "FedEx's long-term funding outlook for postretirement healthcare obligations reflects a strategic shift toward cost containment through both structural and eligibility-based changes. The company transitioned to a lump-sum HRA-based benefit model for eligible U.S. retirees, which limits liability to the notional account balance and caps future exposure (page 105). In 2018, FedEx restricted eligibility for most new employees, significantly reducing the inflow of future beneficiaries. This aligns with the projected payments, which show a gradual increase in annual obligations\u2014$81 million in 2025 rising to $121 million in 2029, with a cumulative $652 million from 2030\u20132034 (page 111). These figures suggest that the company's obligations are growing but remain manageable due to the capped liability per retiree and reduced future participation. The structured funding approach, combined with eligibility restrictions, indicates a deliberate effort to control long-term costs while maintaining retiree healthcare benefits for existing eligible employees.",

      "answer": "FedEx spent $1,627 million on Aircraft and Related Equipment in 2024, while the net book value of this asset class was $30,525 million as of May 31, 2024. Over the next five years, the company is committed to $725 million in lease payments for Aircraft and Related Equipment. This indicates a strategy of continued reliance on leased assets rather than significant new purchases, as capital expenditures for aircraft declined year-over-year and lease obligations remain substantial.",

      "question": "How does the increase in FedEx's business optimization and realignment costs in FY24, as reported in both the income statement and the cash flow statement, reflect the company's strategic focus and financial discipline in managing restructuring initiatives?",
      "answer": "FedEx reported a significant increase in business optimization and realignment costs in FY24, rising from $309 million in FY23 to $582 million in FY24 on the income statement (page_81), indicating a deliberate strategic push toward operational restructuring. However, the cash flow statement shows only $26 million in such costs for FY24 (page_83), suggesting that much of the expense was non-cash or deferred, aligning with a disciplined financial approach to restructuring. This divergence between the income statement and cash flow statement implies that while FedEx is investing heavily in strategic realignment on paper, the immediate cash impact remains limited, supporting liquidity preservation. The cost as a percentage of revenue also increased from 0.4% in FY23 to 0.7% in FY24 (page_56), reinforcing the strategic emphasis on optimization despite its relatively modest impact on overall financials.",

      "answer": "FedEx disclosed $278 million in business realignment costs in 2022 related to the European workforce reduction plan in both the MD&A (page 59) and the financial statements (page 111). The risk factors section (page 32) highlights that the execution of this plan is subject to local consultation processes and negotiated social plans, making the actual cost and timing uncertain. These costs are part of broader strategic investments that carry execution risk, and if the expected cost savings are not realized, FedEx's financial results could suffer. The combination of disclosed costs and execution risk paints a picture where strategic transformation in Europe is both costly and uncertain, with potential long-term financial implications.",

          "chunk_text": "Given the current claims environment, the amount of coverage available from excess insurance carriers is decreasing, the premiums for this excess coverage are increasing significantly, and excess insurance carriers are challenging insurance claims more frequently. Accordingly, our excess insurance and claims expenses may continue to increase, or we could further increase our selfinsured retention as policies are renewed or replaced. In 2015, a jury awarded compensatory damages of approximately $160 million to plaintiffs in connection with a personal injury and wrongful death lawsuit filed against FedEx Ground in New Mexico state court. The award was subsequently affirmed by the New Mexico Court of Appeals and ultimately by the New Mexico Supreme Court in May 2022. While our insurance carriers have funded the approximately $160 million base judgment in excess of FedEx Ground's $7.5 million self-insured retention and insurance deductible, we are currently pursuing insurance coverage for reimbursement of approximately $210 million of pre- and post-judgment interest. See Note 19 of the consolidated financial statements included in 'Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data' of this Annual Report for more information. Our results of operations and financial condition could continue to be adversely affected if our costs or losses significantly exceed our aggregate coverage limits, we are unable to obtain excess insurance coverage in amounts we deem sufficient, our insurance carriers fail to pay on our insurance claims, or we experience a claim for which coverage is not provided.\n\nThe transportation infrastructure continues to be a target of terrorist activities. Because transportation assets continue to be a target of terrorist activities, governments around the world are adopting or are considering adopting stricter security requirements that will increase operating costs and potentially slow service for businesses, including those in the transportation industry. These security requirements are not static, but change periodically as the result of regulatory and legislative requirements, imposing additional security costs and creating a level of uncertainty for our operations. For example, the TSA requires FedEx Express to comply with a Full All-Cargo Aircraft Operator Standard Security Plan, which contains evolving and strict security requirements. Additionally, the ICAO's standard that previously allowed a member state to permit carriers and other entities to determine, without government oversight, which shippers and shipments are secure for purposes of putting those shipments on all-cargo aircraft was modified effective July 1, 2021. As a result, we are now required to undertake additional security measures for international outbound shipments. It is reasonably possible that these rules or other future security requirements could impose material costs on us or slow our service to our customers. The impact on our operations of avoiding areas of the world, including airspace, in which there are geopolitical conflicts and the targeting of aircraft by parties to those conflicts can also be significant. Moreover, a terrorist attack directed at FedEx or other aspects of the transportation infrastructure could disrupt our operations and adversely impact demand for our services.\n\n## Strategic Risks\n\nFailure to successfully implement our business strategy and effectively respond to changes in market dynamics and customer preferences will cause our future financial results to suffer. We are making significant investments and other decisions in connection with our long-term business strategy, such as investments in fleet and facility modernization and strategic investments to increase collaboration and automation and improve productivity, network efficiencies, and safety. Additionally, we are executing initiatives to use data to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members, as well as to transform and optimize the FedEx Express international business, particularly in Europe. See 'Item 1. Business' and 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition' of this Annual Report for additional information.\n\nSuch initiatives and enhancements may require us to make significant capital expenditures or incur significant expenses. We have also incurred, and may continue to incur, increased operating expenses in connection with certain changes to our business strategy. We may not be able to derive the expected operational efficiencies, cost savings, and other benefits from our strategic investments and other decisions. For example, in 2021 we announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe. The execution of the plan is subject to a works council consultation process that will occur through 2023 in accordance with local country processes and regulations. The actual amount and timing of business realignment costs and related cost savings resulting from the workforce reduction plan are dependent on local country consultation processes and regulations and negotiated social plans and may differ from our current expectations and estimates. If we are not able to successfully implement this plan, our future financial results may suffer.\n\nChanges in our business strategy may also expose us to new and heightened risks. For example, ShopRunner, which we acquired in 2020, collects and stores certain personal data of its merchants and their buyers, its partners, consumers with whom it has a direct relationship, and users of its applications. Additionally, it uses third-party service providers and subprocessors to help deliver services to merchants and their buyers. These service providers and subprocessors may store or access personal data, including payment information and/or other confidential information.

          "chunk_text": "\n## FedEx Express Segment Operating Income\n\nFedEx Express segment operating income increased 4% in 2022 primarily due to yield management actions, including the favorable net impact of fuel, lower variable incentive compensation expense, and less severe weather experienced in 2022, partially offset by higher operating expenses related to labor market challenges and inflationary pressures. The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical uncertainty negatively impacted our operations in 2022 as we experienced reduced shipping demand and network disruptions, particularly in the second half of the year. In addition, we experienced lower U.S. average daily freight pounds due to decreased demand and a reduction in charter flights in 2022.\n\nFedEx Express prior year operating results included a pre-tax benefit of approximately $165 million from a reduction in aviation excise taxes provided by the CARES Act, which expired on December 31, 2020 and negatively affected year-over-year comparisons in 2022.\n\nFedEx Express segment results include business realignment costs of $278 million in 2022 associated with our workforce reduction plan in Europe. See the 'Business Realignment Costs' section of this MD&amp;A for more information. FedEx Express segments results also include approximately $115 million of TNT Express integration expenses in 2022, a decrease of $61 million from 2021.\n\nPurchased transportation expense increased 10% in 2022 primarily due to higher utilization of third-party transportation providers and increased rates. Other operating expense increased 8% in 2022 primarily due to higher outside service contract expense, which includes variable costs driven by the constrained labor market, as well as additional volume-related expenses. Rentals and landing fees expense increased 12% in 2022 primarily due to increased vehicle and aircraft leases. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 1% in 2022 primarily due to higher labor costs related to the constrained labor market and wage pressures, partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation expense.\n\nFuel expense increased 80% in 2022 due to increased fuel prices. The net impact of fuel had a significant benefit to operating income in 2022 as higher fuel surcharges outpaced increased fuel prices. See the 'Results of Operations and Outlook Consolidated Results - Fuel' section of this MD&amp;A for a description and additional discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results.\n\n## FedEx Express Segment Outlook\n\nIn 2023, we will focus on actions to improve global network efficiencies and lower our cost to serve as we expect rising uncertainty from the slowing economic environment, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical conditions, to impact our business. In addition, we will execute our disciplined revenue management strategy and implement cost control actions to drive improved revenue and operating income. We will focus on returning to industry-leading service to support yield improvement.\n\nCapital expenditures at FedEx Express are expected to be relatively flat in 2023, with an increase in capital spend primarily related to vehicle purchases including our vehicle electrification initiative, investments in information technology, and package handling equipment, offset by a decrease in aircraft spend. We continue to make multi-year investments in our facilities to expand and modernize the Indianapolis hub and the Memphis World Hub.",

      "answer": "In 2022, FedEx spent $2,273 million on aircraft and related equipment as part of its capital expenditures. Looking ahead, the company has significant lease obligations for aircraft and related equipment, with a present value of lease liability totaling $668 million as of the reporting period. For 2023, FedEx plans to maintain capital expenditures at approximately $6.8 billion, which includes $1.7 billion specifically for aircraft and related equipment, indicating continued investment in this area.

          "chunk_text": "\n## LIQUIDITY OUTLOOK\n\nIn response to current business and economic conditions as referenced above in the 'Outlook' section of this MD&amp;A, we are continuing to actively manage and optimize our capital allocation in a challenging macroeconomic environment due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, labor availability and supply chain constraints, inflationary pressures, rising fuel prices, and geopolitical conflicts. We had $6.9 billion in cash at May 31, 2022 and have $3.5 billion in available liquidity under our $2.0 billion five-year credit agreement (the 'Five-Year Credit Agreement) and $1.5 billion three-year credit agreement (the 'Three-Year Credit Agreement' and together with the Five-Year Credit Agreement, the 'Credit Agreements'), and we believe that our cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, and available financing sources will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs, which include operational requirements, expected capital expenditures, voluntary pension contributions, dividend payments, and stock repurchases.\n\nWe expect to repurchase $1.5 billion of our common stock in 2023.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance at May 31, 2022 includes $2.9 billion of cash in foreign jurisdictions associated with our permanent reinvestment strategy. We are able to access the majority of this cash without a material tax cost and do not believe that the indefinite reinvestment of these funds impairs our ability to meet our U.S. domestic debt or working capital obligations.\n\nOur 2023 capital expenditures are expected to be consistent with 2022 at approximately $6.8 billion. We expect increased investment in replacement vehicles including our vehicle electrification initiative, information technology, and strategic investments aimed to optimize operations across our networks to be offset with lower aircraft fleet modernization spend. Included within our expected 2023 capital expenditures are our continued investments in the FedEx Express Indianapolis hub and FedEx Express Memphis World Hub, which are expected to total $1.5 billion each over the life of each project. Our expected capital expenditures for 2023 also include $1.7 billion for delivery of aircraft and related equipment and progress payments toward future aircraft deliveries at FedEx Express. While we continue to invest in our business, the capital intensity relative to revenue is expected to remain below historical levels.\n\nWe have additional obligations as part of our ordinary course of business, beyond those committed for capital expenditures, which consist of debt obligations, lease obligations, and obligations and commitments for purchases of goods and services. Refer to Note 7, Note 8, and Note 18 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information. In addition, we have certain tax positions that are further discussed in Note 13 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements. We do not have any guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\n\nWe have several aircraft modernization programs underway that are supported by the purchase of Boeing 777 Freighter and Boeing 767-300 Freighter aircraft. These aircraft are significantly more fuel-efficient per unit than the aircraft types previously utilized, and these expenditures are necessary to achieve significant long-term operating savings and to replace older aircraft. Our ability to delay the timing of these aircraft-related expenditures is limited without incurring significant costs to modify existing purchase agreements.\n\nWe have a shelf registration statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission ('SEC') that allows us to sell, in one or more future offerings, any combination of our unsecured debt securities and common stock and allows pass-through trusts formed by FedEx Express to sell, in one or more future offerings, pass-through certificates.\n\nThe Five-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2026 and includes a $250 million letter of credit sublimit. The Three-Year Credit Agreement expires in March 2025. The Credit Agreements are available to finance our operations and other cash flow needs. See Note 7 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a description of the terms and significant covenants of the Credit Agreements.",

The COVID-19 pandemic and geopolitical uncertainty negatively impacted our operations in 2022 as we experienced reduced shipping demand and network disruptions, particularly in the second half of the year. In addition, we experienced lower U.S. average daily freight pounds due to decreased demand and a reduction in charter flights in 2022.\n\nFedEx Express prior year operating results included a pre-tax benefit of approximately $165 million from a reduction in aviation excise taxes provided by the CARES Act, which expired on December 31, 2020 and negatively affected year-over-year comparisons in 2022.\n\nFedEx Express segment results include business realignment costs of $278 million in 2022 associated with our workforce reduction plan in Europe. See the 'Business Realignment Costs' section of this MD&amp;A for more information. FedEx Express segments results also include approximately $115 million of TNT Express integration expenses in 2022, a decrease of $61 million from 2021.\n\nPurchased transportation expense increased 10% in 2022 primarily due to higher utilization of third-party transportation providers and increased rates. Other operating expense increased 8% in 2022 primarily due to higher outside service contract expense, which includes variable costs driven by the constrained labor market, as well as additional volume-related expenses. Rentals and landing fees expense increased 12% in 2022 primarily due to increased vehicle and aircraft leases. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased 1% in 2022 primarily due to higher labor costs related to the constrained labor market and wage pressures, partially offset by lower variable incentive compensation expense.\n\nFuel expense increased 80% in 2022 due to increased fuel prices. The net impact of fuel had a significant benefit to operating income in 2022 as higher fuel surcharges outpaced increased fuel prices. See the 'Results of Operations and Outlook Consolidated Results - Fuel' section of this MD&amp;A for a description and additional discussion of the net impact of fuel on our operating results.\n\n## FedEx Express Segment Outlook\n\nIn 2023, we will focus on actions to improve global network efficiencies and lower our cost to serve as we expect rising uncertainty from the slowing economic environment, including inflationary pressures and geopolitical conditions, to impact our business. In addition, we will execute our disciplined revenue management strategy and implement cost control actions to drive improved revenue and operating income. We will focus on returning to industry-leading service to support yield improvement.\n\nCapital expenditures at FedEx Express are expected to be relatively flat in 2023, with an increase in capital spend primarily related to vehicle purchases including our vehicle electrification initiative, investments in information technology, and package handling equipment, offset by a decrease in aircraft spend. We continue to make multi-year investments in our facilities to expand and modernize the Indianapolis hub and the Memphis World Hub.",

      "answer": "The integration of FedEx Cross Border into FedEx Express in Q3 2022 reflects a strategic decision to streamline operations and align internal reporting structures, which supports more cohesive performance evaluation based on operating income inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations. These allocations are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided, suggesting that the integration could yield cost synergies and more efficient resource utilization across the FedEx Express network. At the same time, with $4.1 billion remaining in the $5 billion stock repurchase program as of July 14, 2022, the integration likely supports capital allocation priorities by enhancing operational efficiency and potentially improving earnings per share through cost reductions. This strategic move aligns with FedEx's broader financial goals of optimizing segment profitability while maintaining flexibility for shareholder returns and long-term investments.",

          "chunk_text": "\nDuring the third quarter of 2022, FedEx Cross Border Holdings, Inc. was merged into FedEx Express.\n\n## FEDEX SERVICES SEGMENT\n\nThe FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on the impact of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments.\n\nOperating expense for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the respective transportation segments. These allocations include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.\n\n## CORPORATE, OTHER, AND ELIMINATIONS\n\nCorporate and other includes corporate headquarters costs for executive officers and certain legal and finance functions, including certain other costs and credits not attributed to our core business, as well as certain costs associated with developing our innovate digitally strategic pillar through our FedEx Dataworks, Inc. (including ShopRunner, Inc.) ('FedEx Dataworks') operating segment. FedEx Dataworks is focused on creating solutions to transform the digital and physical experiences of our customers and team members.\n\nAlso included in Corporate and other are the FedEx Office and Print Services, Inc. operating segment, which provides an array of document and business services and retail access to our customers for our package transportation businesses, and the FedEx Logistics operating segment, which provides integrated supply chain management solutions, specialty transportation, customs brokerage, and global ocean and air freight forwarding.\n\nThe results of Corporate, other, and eliminations are not allocated to the other business segments.\n\nIn 2022, the increase in operating results in Corporate, other, and eliminations was primarily due to improved operating income at FedEx Logistics. Market capacity constraints related to the COVID-19 pandemic drove higher revenue due to increased yields, partially offset by higher purchased transportation costs. In addition, 2022 operating results in Corporate, other, and eliminations include a $210 million charge recognized in the fourth quarter of 2022 related to pre- and post-judgment interest in connection with a FedEx Ground legal matter. See Note 19 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for more information.\n\nCertain FedEx operating companies provide transportation and related services for other FedEx companies outside their reportable segment in order to optimize our resources. For example, during 2022 FedEx Ground provided delivery support for certain FedEx Express packages as part of our last-mile optimization efforts, and FedEx Freight provided road and intermodal support for both FedEx Ground and FedEx Express. In addition, FedEx Express is working with FedEx Logistics to secure air charters for U.S. customers. Billings for such services are based on negotiated rates, which we believe approximate fair value, and are reflected as revenue of the billing segment. These rates are adjusted from time to time based on market conditions. Such intersegment revenue and expenses are eliminated in our consolidated results and are not separately identified in the following segment information because the amounts are not material.",

For the international regions of FedEx Express, some of these functions are performed on a regional basis and reported by FedEx Express in their natural expense line items.\n\nThe FedEx Services segment provides direct and indirect support to our operating segments, and we allocate all of the net operating costs of the FedEx Services segment to reflect the full cost of operating our businesses in the results of those segments. We review and evaluate the performance of our transportation segments based on operating income (inclusive of FedEx Services segment allocations). For the FedEx Services segment, performance is evaluated based on the effect of its total allocated net operating costs on our operating segments.\n\nOperating expenses for each of our transportation segments include the allocations from the FedEx Services segment to the respective transportation segments. These allocations also include charges and credits for administrative services provided between operating companies. The allocations of net operating costs are based on metrics such as relative revenue or estimated services provided. We believe these allocations approximate the net cost of providing these functions. Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.",

      "answer": "Honeywell's NARCO asbestos-related liability is accounted for using estimates based on historical and projected claims data, disease classifications, and average payment values, with a high degree of subjectivity in the assumptions used (page 119). The company projects liability through 2059, factoring in epidemiological disease trends and claims filing rates, and updates its estimates annually (page 48). Historical data from 2020 to 2021 shows a decline in recorded asbestos-related liabilities from $300 million to $261 million (page 90), suggesting evolving liability estimates that must be reconciled with forward-looking assumptions and audit complexities described in the financial statements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Audit Matters\n\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to  the  financial  statements  and  (2)  involved  our  especially  challenging,  subjective,  or  complex  judgments. The  communication  of critical  audit  matters  does  not  alter  in  any  way  our  opinion  on  the  financial  statements,  taken  as  a  whole,  and  we  are  not,  by communicating  the  critical  audit  matters  below,  providing  separate  opinions  on  the  critical  audit  matters  or  on  the  accounts  or disclosures to which they relate.\n\n## Asbestos Related Liabilities - North American Refractories Company (NARCO) Asbestos Liability - Refer to Note 19 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company records an estimated liability for asbestos related personal injury claims related to a predecessor company, NARCO. Such claims arise primarily from alleged occupational exposure to asbestos-containing refractory brick and mortar.\n\nThe  Company's  NARCO  asbestos-related  liability  reflects  an  estimated  liability  for  the  resolution  of  asserted  and  unasserted NARCO-related asbestos claims that are probable of occurrence and reasonably estimable. The Company records an estimated liability  for  the  resolution  of  asserted Annual  Contribution  Claims  and  Pre-Established  Unliquidated  Claims  filed  with  the  NARCO Trust  using  average  payment  values  for  the  relevant  historical  period.  The  Company  also  records  an  estimated  liability  for unasserted Annual  Contribution  Claims  and  Pre-Established  Unliquidated  Claims  based  on  historic  and  anticipated  claims  filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the NARCO Trust for the relevant historical period. Beginning in 2020, with three years of sufficiently reliable claims data, the Company updated its estimate of the NARCO asbestos-related liability.\n\nAccounting  for  the  NARCO  asbestos-related  liability  is  an  inherently  subjective  exercise  as  it  requires  management  to  make significant  assumptions and judgments. Given the subjectivity related to estimating the NARCO asbestos-related liability and the assessment of the sufficiency and reliability of the claims data, auditing the NARCO asbestos-related liability involved especially subjective judgment.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the NARCO asbestos-related liability included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of internal controls over the estimate of the NARCO asbestos-related liability including management's controls over the estimate for asserted and unasserted Annual Contribution Claims and Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims.\n- We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the NARCO asbestos-related liability by:\n- Reading the Company's analysis and third-party assessment to evaluate the Company's methodology used in the analysis.\n- Confirming the claims data with the NARCO Trust to evaluate the appropriateness of the underlying data used in the analysis.\n- Making inquiries of the Company's third-party specialist to identify the significant assumptions used to develop the analysis.\n- Making  inquiries  of  internal  and  external  legal  counsel  regarding  the  regulatory  and  litigation  environments  related  to  the NARCO asbestos-related liability.\n- With the assistance of our internal actuarial specialists, we developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the Company's recorded NARCO asbestos-related liability.\n\n## Revenue Recognition and Contracts with Customers - Long-Term Contracts - Refer to Note 1 and Note 3 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company has several businesses which enter into long-term contracts whereby revenue is recognized over the contract term ('over time') as the work progresses and control of the goods and services are continuously transferred to the customer. Revenue for these contracts is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion, generally measured by using a cost-to-cost input method.\n\nAccounting for long-term contracts requires management's judgment in estimating total contract costs. Contract costs, which can be incurred over several years, are largely determined based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms and consider factors such  as  historical  performance  trends,  inflationary  trends,  technical  and  schedule  risk,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization and anticipated labor agreements.\n\nGiven the significance of the judgments necessary to estimate costs associated with these long-term contracts (which varies upon the length of the contract), auditing long-term contracts requires a high degree of auditor judgment.\n\n114\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

          "chunk_text": "\nPension ongoing income for our world-wide pension plans is expected to be approximately $1,008 million in 2022 compared with Pension ongoing income of $1,083 million in 2021. The expected decrease in pension income is primarily due to lower expected return on plan assets caused by a change in allocation of UK plan assets and higher interest costs caused by increased discount rates in our U.S. and UK plans. Also, if required, a MTM Adjustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably forecast or predict whether there will be a MTM Adjustment in 2022, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. MTM Adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.\n\nAsbestos  Related  Liabilities  and  Insurance  Recoveries -In  connection  with  the  recognition  of  liabilities  for  asbestos  related matters,  we  record  asbestos  related  insurance  recoveries  that  are  deemed  probable.  In  assessing  the  probability  of  insurance recovery,  we  make  judgments  concerning  insurance  coverage  that  we  believe  are  reasonable  and  consistent  with  our  historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual carriers are insolvent, which has been considered in our analysis of probable recoveries. Projecting future events is subject to various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability, our recovery experience or other relevant factors that may impact future insurance recoveries.\n\nOur  involvement  in  asbestos  related  personal  injury  actions  relates  to  two  predecessor  companies.  Regarding  North  American Refractories Company (NARCO) asbestos related claims, we estimate our NARCO asbestos liability for the resolution of asserted NARCO-related asbestos claims which qualify for payment under the NARCO Trust Distribution Procedures (Annual Contribution Claims)  and  for  amounts  owed  pursuant  to  settlement  agreements  reached  during  the  pendency  of  the  NARCO  bankruptcy proceedings that provide for the right to submit claims to the NARCO Trust subject to qualification under the terms of the settlement agreements and Trust Distribution Procedures (Pre-Established Unliquidated Claims) using average payment values for the relevant historical  period.  We  estimate our NARCO asbestos liability for unasserted claims based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and payment rates, disease classifications and type of claim, and average payment values by the NARCO Trust for the relevant historical period. Our estimate also includes all years of epidemiological disease projection through 2059. Regarding Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix) asbestos related claims, we accrued for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values for the previous five years. We also accrued for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological  disease  projection  through  2059  based  on  historic  and  anticipated  claims  filing  experience  and  dismissal  rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system for the previous five years. We update our assumptions on average payment values and average resolution values in the fourth quarter of each year.\n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management's judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.",

      "question": "How do Honeywell's financial statements reconcile the negative impact of changes in fair value of available for sale investments in 2021 with their overall comprehensive income trends and equity adjustments over the same period?",
      "answer": "Honeywell's financial statements show that the negative impact of changes in fair value of available for sale investments in 2021 was minimal at $3 million (after-tax), as seen in the Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (AOCI) section. This small loss contrasts with the broader trend of positive comprehensive income of $6,092 million in 2021, driven by strong net income of $5,610 million. Additionally, the equity section shows that this $3 million reduction in AOCI was part of a larger context where foreign exchange translation adjustments added $302 million and pension adjustments added $186 million to equity, indicating that the fair value change had a negligible effect on overall equity in 2021.",

      "answer": "Honeywell reported $569 million in repositioning and other charges in 2021 within the consolidated cash flow statement, while the segment-level disclosures indicated that these charges were distributed across different business units but excluded from segment profit. The corporate-level explanation noted that the cash spending related to repositioning actions in 2021 was $382 million, which was funded through operating cash flows. This indicates that while the total charges recognized were $569 million, the actual cash outlay was lower at $382 million, suggesting a portion of the charges may have been non-cash or accrued for future payments.",

      "question": "How do Boeing's production rate adjustments for the 777X and 787 programs, as influenced by certification delays, market demand, and abnormal production costs, collectively impact the profitability outlook for these programs and the company's broader commercial aircraft strategy?",
      "answer": "Boeing's production rate adjustments for the 777X and 787 programs are significantly influenced by certification delays, market uncertainty, and abnormal production costs, all of which have a direct bearing on profitability and strategic positioning. For the 777X, production rate adjustments were made in response to updated certification timelines (now expected in late 2023), supply chain disruptions, and customer delivery negotiations, leading to a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss and near break-even margins as of December 31, 2021. Meanwhile, the 787 program has faced prolonged delivery pauses due to production quality issues and FAA engagement, resulting in production rates below 5 per month\u2014classified as abnormally low\u2014triggering $2 billion in cumulative abnormal production costs, with $3.5 billion in losses recorded in Q4 2021 alone. These adjustments also reflect broader market sensitivity, particularly in China, where the lack of new 787 orders could necessitate further production rate reductions. Collectively, these factors constrain Boeing\u2019s ability to return these programs to profitability and influence strategic decisions around resource allocation, production efficiency, and customer negotiations across its commercial aircraft segment.",

Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  the  particular  program,  such  as  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under  contract.  The  sales  prices  for  all  undelivered  units  within  the  accounting  quantity  include  an  escalation adjustment  for  inflation  that  is  updated  quarterly.  Cost  estimates  are  based  largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflationary or deflationary trends.\n\nTo  ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a quarterly  basis.  This  includes  reassessing  the  accounting  quantity.  Changes  in  estimates  of  program  gross  profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs  already  included  in  inventory  exceed  estimated  revenues  from  the  program,  a  loss  is  recorded  in  the  current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nThe 747, 767 and 777X programs have near break-even margins, and the 787 program has zero margin at December 31, 2021. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in additional earnings charges in future periods.\n\n777X Program During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X to late 2023 and recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program. The revised schedule and reach-forward loss reflected  a  number  of  factors,  including  an  updated  assessment  of  global  certification  requirements  informed  by continued discussions with regulators and a management decision in the fourth quarter of 2020 to make modifications to  the  aircraft's  design,  an  updated  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand  and  discussions  with  our customers with respect to aircraft delivery timing. These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the program  accounting  quantity,  increased  change  incorporation  costs,  and  associated  customer  and  supply  chain impacts. The  initial  accounting  quantity  of  350  airplanes  established  in  the  fourth  quarter  of  2020  consists  of  777X passenger airplanes and remained unchanged during 2021.\n\nWe are working towards reaching TIA which will enable us to begin FAA certification flight testing. The timing of TIA and certification  will  ultimately  be  determined  by  the  regulators,  and  further  determinations  with  respect  to  anticipated certification requirements could result in additional delays in entry into service and/or additional cost increases.\n\nWe continue to anticipate that the first 777X delivery will occur in late 2023. The 777X program has near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reachforward losses on the 777X program in future periods, which may be material.",

These  impacts have resulted in longer than expected delivery delays and associated  customer considerations.\n\nThe timing of the resumption of deliveries and future production rates will depend upon rework, ongoing customer and supplier  engagement,  production  stability  and  our  activities  with  the  FAA.  China  is  a  significant  market  for  the  787 program, and if the program is unable to obtain additional orders from China in future quarters, we may be required to further  adjust  production  rate  assumptions.  If  we  are  required  to  further  reduce  the  accounting  quantity  and/or production  rates,  experience  further  delivery  delays  or  experience  other  factors  that  result  in  lower  margins,  the program could record additional losses and higher abnormal production costs in future periods.\n\nFleet Support We provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. Collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane  delivery  and  continue  throughout  the  operational  life  of  the  airplane.  They  include  flight  and  maintenance training,  field  service  support,  engineering  services,  information  services  and  systems  and  technical  data  and documents. The costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1% of total consolidated costs of products and services.\n\nProgram  Development The  following  chart  summarizes  the  time  horizon  between  go-ahead  and  planned  initial delivery for major Commercial Airplanes derivatives and programs.\n\nReflects models in development during 2021\n\nThe development schedules shown above are subject to a number of uncertainties, including changes in certification requirements. The timing of certifications will ultimately be determined by the regulators.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\nThe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from employees and other partners. Meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging, such as the 787 production issues and associated rework. In addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 777X and 737 MAX derivatives, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules.  These  challenges include increased global regulatory scrutiny of all development aircraft in the wake of the 737 MAX accidents. As a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance  and  reliability  standards  and  achieve  or  maintain,  as  applicable,  program  profitability  is  subject  to significant  risks.  Factors  that  could  result  in  lower  margins  (or  a  material  charge  if  an  airplane  program  has  or  is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, the addition of regulatory requirements in connection with certification in one or more jurisdictions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier claims or assertions and other contractual negotiations.

These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reachforward losses on the 777X program in future periods.\n\n787 Program During 2020, we experienced significant reductions in deliveries due to the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers as well as production issues and associated rework. During 2021 we delivered 14 aircraft between March 2021 and May 2021 prior to deliveries being paused in May 2021. Deliveries remain paused.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had approximately 110 and 80 aircraft in inventory. We have identified production quality  issues,  including  in  our  supply  chain,  which  have  contributed  to  the  pause  in  deliveries.  In  July  2021,  we announced that we were reprioritizing production resources to support inspections and rework. We continue to conduct inspections  and  rework  on  undelivered  aircraft  and  engage  in  detailed  discussions  with  the  FAA  regarding  required actions for resuming delivery of the 787. We are currently producing at very low rates and expect that to continue until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 per month over time. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that in the current  environment  production  rates  below  5  per  month  represent  abnormally  low  production  rates  and  result  in abnormal production costs, and that inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that are required to be expensed as incurred. In the fourth quarter of 2021,  we  determined  that  the  ongoing  rework,  as  well  as  our  ongoing  discussions  with  the  FAA  in  anticipation  of resumption  of  deliveries,  will  result  in  lower  production  rates  longer  than  previously  expected. As  a  result  of  these impacts,  we  expect  to  incur  approximately  $2  billion  of  abnormal  production  costs  on  a  cumulative  basis  with  most being  incurred  by  the  end  of  2023.  We  continue  to  work  with  customers  and  suppliers  regarding  timing  of  future deliveries  and  production  rate  changes.  We  are  also  continuing  to  implement  changes  in  the  production  process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. During  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  we  consolidated  787  production  in  South  Carolina,  in  line  with  our  previous assumptions, which did not have a significant financial impact on the program.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework, as well as other actions required to resume 787 deliveries, taking longer than",

The 2020 loss reflects the reach-forward loss on 777X of $6,493 million, lower deliveries and lower program margins resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic,  $2,567  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  related  to  737  MAX,  $623  million  of  severance  cost,  $498 million of 737 MAX customer considerations, $336 million related to 737NG frame fitting component repair costs and $270  million  of  abnormal  production  costs  in  the  first  half  of  2020  from  the  temporary  suspension  of  operations  in response to COVID-19, partially offset by lower research and development spending. Lower 787 margins reflecting a reduction  in  the  accounting  quantity  in  the  first  quarter  of  2020  also  contributed  to  lower  earnings.

These  decreases  were  partially  offset  by  a continued buildup of 787 aircraft, as well as growth in 777X inventory. Commercial aircraft programs inventory includes approximately  335  737  MAX  aircraft  and  110  787  aircraft  at  December  31,  2021  as  compared  with  425  737  MAX aircraft and 80 787 aircraft at December 31, 2020.\n\nA number of customers have requested to defer deliveries or to cancel orders.

At December 31, 2021, $1,906 of 737 deferred production costs, unamortized tooling and other nonrecurring costs are expected to be recovered from units included in the program accounting quantity that have firm orders,  and  $7  is  expected  to  be  recovered  from  units  included  in  the  program  accounting  quantity  that  represent expected future orders.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, commercial aircraft programs inventory included the following amounts related to the 777X program: $3,363 and $1,727 of work in process and $3,521 and $3,295 of unamortized tooling and other nonrecurring costs.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 777X program plus costs already included in 777X inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program.

As a result, 777X deferred production costs were immaterial at December 31, 2020 and remain immaterial at December 31, 2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, any contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reach-forward losses on the 777X program in future periods.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we determined that estimated costs to complete the 787 program plus costs already included in 787 inventory exceed estimated revenues from the program.

The Company uses program accounting in order to compute cost of sales and margin for each  commercial  airplane  sold.  The  use  of  program  accounting  requires  estimating  and  demonstrating  customer demand for the number of units included in the program (program accounting quantity) and estimating the sales and costs  over  the  expected  life  of  each  program.  In  particular,  estimating  the  initial  program  accounting  quantity  and revenue for unsold units within the program accounting quantity involves measurement uncertainty resulting in a range of reasonable outcomes. Additionally, the level of effort to meet regulatory requirements and achieve certification may be challenging to predict, resulting in delays in the timing of entry into service and corresponding increases in estimated costs.  Changes  to  the  program  accounting  quantity  or  revenue  and  cost  estimates  could  occur,  resulting  in  lower margins or material reach-forward losses. Auditing the estimated revenues and costs for the 777X program involved extensive audit effort and required audit professionals with specialized industry experience given the high degree of complexity and subjectivity related to management's estimates.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures over the estimated revenues and costs for the anticipated 777X program accounting quantity included the following, among others:\n\n- We inquired of the Company's management, including individuals responsible for sales and pricing, to evaluate the  status  of  current  sales  campaigns,  short  and  long-term  market  demand,  and  status  of  negotiations  with individual customers.\n- We compared management's estimate of market demand to external industry sources of expected demand.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  and  significant  assumptions used in developing its estimates related to the initial program accounting quantity and revenue for unsold units.\n- We evaluated management's ability to estimate program revenue by comparison to historical estimates and actual results on similar programs.\n- We evaluated  the  appropriateness  and  consistency  of  management's  methods  used  in  developing  its  cost estimates.\n- We performed inquiries of those directly involved with the certification of the aircraft to evaluate project status and challenges which may affect total estimated costs to achieve certification of the aircraft.\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls including those over the key data used in developing the estimates, the mathematical  extrapolation  of  such  data,  and  management's  judgment  regarding  the  range  of  reasonable outcomes relating to the specific estimates.",

These factors resulted in adjustments to production rates and the  program  accounting  quantity,  increased  change  incorporation  costs,  and  associated  customer  and  supply  chain impacts.

The 777X program has near break-even gross margins at December 31, 2021. The level of profitability on the 777X program will be subject to a number of factors. These factors include continued market uncertainty, the impacts of COVID-19 on our production system as well as impacts on our supply chain and customers, customer negotiations, further production rate adjustments for the 777X or other commercial aircraft programs, contraction of the accounting quantity and potential risks associated with the testing program and the timing of aircraft certification. One or more of these factors could result in additional reachforward losses on the 777X program in future periods.\n\n787 Program During 2020, we experienced significant reductions in deliveries due to the impacts of COVID-19 on our customers as well as production issues and associated rework. During 2021 we delivered 14 aircraft between March 2021 and May 2021 prior to deliveries being paused in May 2021. Deliveries remain paused.\n\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020 we had approximately 110 and 80 aircraft in inventory. We have identified production quality  issues,  including  in  our  supply  chain,  which  have  contributed  to  the  pause  in  deliveries.  In  July  2021,  we announced that we were reprioritizing production resources to support inspections and rework. We continue to conduct inspections  and  rework  on  undelivered  aircraft  and  engage  in  detailed  discussions  with  the  FAA  regarding  required actions for resuming delivery of the 787. We are currently producing at very low rates and expect that to continue until deliveries resume, gradually returning to 5 per month over time. In the third quarter of 2021, we determined that in the current  environment  production  rates  below  5  per  month  represent  abnormally  low  production  rates  and  result  in abnormal production costs, and that inspections and rework costs on inventoried aircraft are excessive and should also be accounted for as abnormal production costs that are required to be expensed as incurred. In the fourth quarter of 2021,  we  determined  that  the  ongoing  rework,  as  well  as  our  ongoing  discussions  with  the  FAA  in  anticipation  of resumption  of  deliveries,  will  result  in  lower  production  rates  longer  than  previously  expected. As  a  result  of  these impacts,  we  expect  to  incur  approximately  $2  billion  of  abnormal  production  costs  on  a  cumulative  basis  with  most being  incurred  by  the  end  of  2023.  We  continue  to  work  with  customers  and  suppliers  regarding  timing  of  future deliveries  and  production  rate  changes.  We  are  also  continuing  to  implement  changes  in  the  production  process designed to ensure that newly-built airplanes meet our specifications and do not require further inspections and rework. During  the  first  quarter  of  2021,  we  consolidated  787  production  in  South  Carolina,  in  line  with  our  previous assumptions, which did not have a significant financial impact on the program.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded a loss of $3.5 billion on the program primarily due to the additional rework, as well as other actions required to resume 787 deliveries, taking longer than",

Estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that  are  indicative  of  the  demand  for  the  particular  program,  such  as  firm  orders,  letters  of  intent  from  prospective customers and market studies. Total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under  contract.  The  sales  prices  for  all  undelivered  units  within  the  accounting  quantity  include  an  escalation adjustment  for  inflation  that  is  updated  quarterly.  Cost  estimates  are  based  largely  on  negotiated  and  anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. Factors that influence  these  estimates  include  production  rates,  internal  and  subcontractor  performance  trends,  customer  and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, COVID-19 disruptions, and inflationary or deflationary trends.\n\nTo  ensure  reliability  in  our  estimates,  we  employ  a  rigorous  estimating  process  that  is  reviewed  and  updated  on  a quarterly  basis.  This  includes  reassessing  the  accounting  quantity.  Changes  in  estimates  of  program  gross  profit margins are normally recognized on a prospective basis; however, when estimated costs to complete a program plus costs  already  included  in  inventory  exceed  estimated  revenues  from  the  program,  a  loss  is  recorded  in  the  current period. Reductions to the estimated loss are included in the gross profit margin for undelivered units in the accounting quantity whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded as an earnings charge in the period in which the loss is determined.\n\nThe 747, 767 and 777X programs have near break-even margins, and the 787 program has zero margin at December 31, 2021. Adverse changes to the revenue and/or cost estimates for these programs could result in additional earnings charges in future periods.\n\n777X Program During the fourth quarter of 2020, we revised the estimated first delivery date of the 777X to late 2023 and recorded a $6.5 billion reach-forward loss on the 777X program. The revised schedule and reach-forward loss reflected  a  number  of  factors,  including  an  updated  assessment  of  global  certification  requirements  informed  by continued discussions with regulators and a management decision in the fourth quarter of 2020 to make modifications to  the  aircraft's  design,  an  updated  assessment  of  COVID-19  impacts  on  market  demand  and  discussions  with  our customers with respect to aircraft delivery timing.

Net proceeds of $1.98 billion were received from the offering after deducting pricing discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the Recent Notes. We pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year with the first payment made on August 15, 2024. We may, at our option, redeem the Recent Notes of any series in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Recent Notes to be redeemed or an applicable make-whole amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.

Net proceeds of $1,975 million were received from the offering after deducting pricing discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized and recorded as interest ex pense over the term of the Earlier Notes. We paid interest on the 2028 Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 with the first payment made on November 15, 2023. Additionally, we pay interest on the 2034 Notes and the initial 2055 Notes on February 15 and August 15 of each year with the first payment made on August 15, 2023. We may, at our option, redeem the Earlier Notes of any series in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of 100% of the principal amount of the Earlier Notes to be redeemed or an applicable make-whole amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption.

Substantially all of our postretirement benefit obligations relate to U.S. based defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. The majority of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits within limits imposed by federal tax law (referred to as qualified plans).  However, certain of our  U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law (referred to as nonqualified plans).",

      "question": "How does the treatment of CAS pension cost in segment operations, the reconciliation of FAS pension income to CAS pension cost, and the presentation of the FAS/CAS pension adjustment in the consolidated statements of earnings collectively impact Lockheed Martin's financial performance and cost recovery on U.S. government contracts?",
      "answer": "Lockheed Martin's CAS pension cost is embedded in segment results and directly recovered through pricing on U.S. government contracts, as noted in the operational treatment on page 37. The reconciliation on page 38 shows that in 2024, CAS pension cost was $1,684 million, while FAS pension income was only $2 million, resulting in a total FAS/CAS pension adjustment of $1,686 million. This adjustment is split into a $1,624 million favorable operating adjustment (from the difference between FAS service cost of -$60 million and CAS cost) and $62 million of non-service FAS pension income. As described on page 73, the favorable operating adjustment flows into consolidated earnings, directly enhancing reported profitability. Thus, the alignment between CAS cost recognition in segments, the FAS/CAS adjustment mechanics, and the consolidated earnings presentation ensures that pension costs are effectively recovered from government contracts and favorably influence earnings.",

However, this charge continues a downward trend in unallocated impairment and severance costs, which declined from $100 million in 2022 to $92 million in 2023 and then $87 million in 2024. Despite this reduction, the Aeronautics segment\u2014where Sikorsky is categorized\u2014saw a modest increase in operating profit from $2,825 million in 2023 to $2,523 million in 2024, indicating that the strategic review and associated charges did not significantly improve segment-level profitability.

The fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency forward contracts, including embedded derivatives, and interest rate swap contracts, are primarily determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign currency ex change rates.\n\nWe use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to minimize fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian kroner and the Polish zloty. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate  changes  primarily  through  our  borrowing  activities.  For  fix ed  rate  borrowings,  we  may  use  variable  interest  rate  swaps,  effectively  converting  fix ed  rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to minimize certain economic exposures.\n\nThe aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.5 billion and $6.5 billion. The fair values of our outstanding interest rate swaps and foreign  currency  hedges  at  December  31,  2024  and  2023  were  not  significant.  Derivative  instruments  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on  net  earnings  and comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The impact of derivative instruments on our consolidated statements of cash flows is included in net cash provided by operating activities. Substantially all of our derivatives are designated for hedge accounting. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies - Derivative financial instruments.'\n\nWe also make investments in early-stage companies that we believe are advancing or developing new technologies applicable to our business. Investments that have quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) are recorded at fair value and reflected in other securities while certain investments are categorized as Level 3 when valuations using observable inputs are unavailable. See 'Note 1 - Organization and Significant Accounting Policies - Investments.'\n\nIn addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and debt. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated their fair values. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $20.2 billion and $18.5 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The outstanding principal amount of debt, including short-term and long-term debt, was $21.6 billion and $18.7 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, excluding $1.3 billion of unamortized discounts and issuance costs at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The estimated fair values of our outstanding debt were determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates and credit spreads (Level 2).\n\n## Note 16 - Impairment and Severance Charges\n\nDuring 2024, we recorded charges totaling $87 million ($69 million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax) for trademark and fixed asset impairments as well as severance costs resulting from the strategic review of our Sikorsky business during the second quarter of 2024 due, in part, to the impacts of the U.S. Army announcement to cancel the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program at the conclusion of fiscal year 2024, for which our Sikorsky business was competing.",

      "question": "How does the funded status of LMT's retiree life insurance plans reconcile with the assets' fair value categorization and the amounts recognized on the consolidated balance sheet?",
      "answer": "The funded status of LMT's retiree life insurance plans, which shows a net unfunded status of $1,234 million, must be understood in conjunction with the fair value categorization of plan assets and the balance sheet recognition. The assets of the plans, valued at $567 million, are categorized by asset class and include certain investments measured at NAV due to the lack of readily determinable fair values. These NAV-measured assets are excluded from the fair value hierarchy but are necessary for reconciling the funded status. On the consolidated balance sheet, the unfunded liability of $1,234 million is recorded as a liability, reflecting the difference between the projected benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. This interconnected view highlights how the funded status is derived from the fair value disclosures and directly impacts the balance sheet recognition.",

      "answer": "UPS's Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Expenses increased by $51 million year-over-year (0.4%) globally, as seen in the consolidated operating expense table (page_38), while the International Package segment reported a $98 million decrease (-0.8%) in Non-GAAP Adjusted Operating Expenses (page_41). This divergence is explained by the MD&A section (page_40), which highlights that increases in pickup and delivery costs ($187 million) and sortation costs ($54 million) were partially offset by reductions in air network costs ($126 million). The segment-level data shows that despite these cost pressures, the International Package segment managed to reduce expenses, likely due to strategic actions like the Fit to Serve program and lower volumes in the first half of the year.",

Pickup and delivery costs increased $187 million driven by increased total delivery stops and costs of purchased transportation. Package sortation costs increased $54 million, as a result of higher year-over-year export volumes, and expanded weekend operations, included in this activity are compensation and benefit costs. Additionally, we incurred an $88 million expense during 2024 related to the settlement of a previously disclosed one-time international regulatory matter. These increases were partially offset by reductions in air network costs of $126 million, driven by lower average fuel prices and reductions in air charters and aircraft block hours in response to lower volumes in the first half of the year. We expect overall operating expenses to increase in 2025 primarily as a result of ex pected volume increases.\n\nNon-GAAP adjusted operating expenses in 2024 exclude the impact of the $88 million regulatory expense noted above, $2 million in asset impairment charges and $79 million in transformation strategy expenses. Transformation strategy activities within our International Package segment during 2024 primarily consisted of compensation and benefits expenses related to workforce reductions under our Fit to Serve program. For additional information on these programs and the related costs, see 'Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability.'\n\n## Operating Profit and Margin\n\nAs a result of the factors described above, operating profit decreased $40 million, with operating margin decreasing 30 basis points to 17.8%. Non-GAAP adjusted operating profit increased $78 million and non-GAAP adjusted operating margin increased 30 basis points to 18.7%.\n\nDuring 2024, we completed the previously disclosed liquidation of our Small Package subsidiaries in Russia and Belarus. The process of liquidating our Forwarding and Logistics subsidiaries in Russia are on-going and we expect to finalize the liquidation in 2025.

      "question": "How would the $126 million reduction in air network costs in 2024 likely affect UPS's reportable segments, given their use of activity-based costing for allocating these expenses, and what does this imply about cost efficiency in relation to expected volume increases in 2025?",
      "answer": "The $126 million reduction in air network costs in 2024, driven by lower fuel prices and reduced air charter usage, would be allocated across UPS's reportable segments using activity-based costing methods. Pages 127 and 128 indicate that air network costs are distributed between segments based on usage patterns through these costing models. Therefore, segments with lower air utilization\u2014such as those handling more ground-based or regional deliveries\u2014would likely see proportionally smaller cost allocations. This cost efficiency, combined with the expectation of volume increases in 2025, suggests that UPS may see improved segment-level profitability if the cost savings are retained or further optimized.",

        "Hop 1: [UPS](page_128) \u2192 [Air Network Costs]: Discloses that air network costs are allocated across segments using activity-based costing methods, which means cost reductions are distributed based on usage patterns.",

However, UPS expects Forwarding revenue to grow in 2025 due to improvements in international airfreight, which increased $52 million in 2024 on higher market rates and e-commerce-driven volume growth, particularly on Asia export lanes. Additionally, ocean freight forwarding revenue rose due to improved market rates that offset lower volumes.

These reductions were partially offset by growth in Logistics and certain of our other businesses.\n\nWithin our Logistics businesses revenue increased $510 million. The acquisition of MNX Global Logistics in the fourth quarter of 2023 contributed $303 million of the increase, including revenue related to healthcare customers. Revenue in mail services increased $206 million driven by new customer volume and rate increases in the second half of the year. We expect continued growth within our Logistics businesses in 2025, driven by expected growth from our healthcare customers.\n\nWithin our Forwarding businesses, revenue decreased $806 million. Revenue from Coyote decreased $976 million due to lower volumes, continued softness in market rates, and the completion of the divestiture. International airfreight revenue increased $52 million, primarily due to increases in market rates. V olume also grew during the year, particularly on the Asia ex port lanes, driven by growth from e-commerce customers. We expect revenue growth to continue during 2025, driven by improving customer mix. Ocean freight forwarding revenue also increased, driven by an increase in market rates resulting from improved market dynamics as the year progressed, which more than offset lower volumes during the year. We expect revenue growth to continue into 2025 driven by these higher rates.\n\nRevenue from our other businesses within Supply Chain Solutions increased. In our digital businesses, revenue increased $163 million, driven by volume growth at Roadie and the full-year impact of Happy Returns, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023.",

      "answer": "UPS's Logistics revenue grew by $510 million in 2024, contributing to the broader Supply Chain Solutions segment, which saw total revenue decline slightly to $12.734 billion from $12.922 billion in the prior year. This growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of MNX Global Logistics, which added $303 million, and increased mail services revenue of $206 million due to new customer volume and rate increases. Despite the Coyote divestiture reducing Forwarding revenue by $976 million, UPS expects continued growth in Logistics in 2025, particularly from healthcare customers, indicating a strategic focus on high-growth verticals within the Logistics business.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Revenue\n\nTotal revenue within Supply Chain Solutions decreased, primarily driven by the September 2024 divestiture of Coyote. These reductions were partially offset by growth in Logistics and certain of our other businesses.\n\nWithin our Logistics businesses revenue increased $510 million. The acquisition of MNX Global Logistics in the fourth quarter of 2023 contributed $303 million of the increase, including revenue related to healthcare customers. Revenue in mail services increased $206 million driven by new customer volume and rate increases in the second half of the year. We expect continued growth within our Logistics businesses in 2025, driven by expected growth from our healthcare customers.\n\nWithin our Forwarding businesses, revenue decreased $806 million. Revenue from Coyote decreased $976 million due to lower volumes, continued softness in market rates, and the completion of the divestiture. International airfreight revenue increased $52 million, primarily due to increases in market rates. V olume also grew during the year, particularly on the Asia ex port lanes, driven by growth from e-commerce customers. We expect revenue growth to continue during 2025, driven by improving customer mix. Ocean freight forwarding revenue also increased, driven by an increase in market rates resulting from improved market dynamics as the year progressed, which more than offset lower volumes during the year. We expect revenue growth to continue into 2025 driven by these higher rates.\n\nRevenue from our other businesses within Supply Chain Solutions increased. In our digital businesses, revenue increased $163 million, driven by volume growth at Roadie and the full-year impact of Happy Returns, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of 2023.",

      "question": "How does UPS's treatment of the one-time compensation payment in both its non-GAAP adjustments and tax expense reconciliation reflect its strategic positioning of the payment as a non-recurring item, especially when compared to its broader transformation and pension-related costs?",
      "answer": "UPS treated the one-time compensation payment as a non-recurring item in both its non-GAAP adjustments and tax expense reconciliation, aligning with its strategic framing of the payment as an isolated expense tied to the 2023 labor agreement ratification with the Teamsters. On page 32, the payment is explicitly excluded from operating performance evaluation and incentive compensation decisions, reinforcing its one-time nature. In the tax reconciliation (page 49), the $15 million associated with the payment in 2023 is shown to have fully dropped off in 2024, consistent with the company\u2019s statement that it does not expect such payments to recur. When compared to other transformation strategy costs (which decreased from $102 million in 2023 to $77 million in 2024) and the significant increase in defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan losses ($85 million to $159 million), the removal of the one-time compensation payment supports UPS's narrative that certain expenses are transitional or strategic rather than operational. This allows UPS to present a cleaner view of underlying performance.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [UPS](page_32) \u2192 [One-Time Compensation Payment]: Discloses the payment as a non-recurring, excluded item from operating performance evaluation and incentive compensation decisions, emphasizing its isolated nature tied to the 2023 Teamsters labor agreement.",
        "Hop 2: [UPS](page_49) \u2192 [One-Time Compensation Payment]: Reflects the payment as a $15 million expense in 2023 with $0 in 2024 in the income tax impact table, confirming the non-recurring nature and aligning with the qualitative statement from page 32.",
        "Hop 3: [UPS](page_29) \u2192 [One-Time Compensation Payment]: Appears in the non-GAAP income tax expense adjustments with $15 million in 2023 and $0 in 2024, further validating its exclusion from ongoing financial performance and placing it in the same category as other strategic and transformational costs."

AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\n\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\n## Goodwill and Asset Impairment Charges\n\nWe exclude the impact of goodwill and asset impairment charges which we do not consider when evaluating the operating performance of our business units, making decisions to allocate resources or in determining incentive compensation awards. For more information regarding goodwill and current year asset impairment charges, see note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## One-Time Compensation Payment\n\nWe exclude the impact of a one-time payment made to certain U.S.-based, non-union part-time supervisors following the ratification of our labor agreement with the Teamsters in 2023. We do not expect this or similar payments to recur.\n\n## Expense for Regulatory Matter\n\nWe exclude the impact of a charge to settle a regulatory matter that we consider to be unrelated to our ongoing operations and that we do not expect to recur. For more information regarding this regulatory matter, see note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Multiemployer Pension Plan Withdrawal Expense\n\nWe exclude the impact of a charge related to the withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan within the United States. We do not consider this expense to be related to our ongoing operations. For more information regarding our multiemployer pension plans, see note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Defined Benefit Pension and Postretirement Medical Plan Gains and Losses\n\nWe incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pension and postretirement medical benefits. These pension and postretirement medical benefits costs for company-sponsored defined benefit plans are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies, including discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increase rates, mortality rates and coordination of benefits with plans not sponsored by UPS. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, unless circumstances require an interim remeasurement of any of our plans.\n\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation), as well as gains and losses resulting from plan curtailments and settlements, for our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plans immediately as part of Investment income (expense) and other in the statements of consolidated income. We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with adjusted measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects. We believe excluding these defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan gains and losses provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with plan amendments and short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values and similar factors.",

      "question": "How does UPS's fluctuation in foreign currency exchange contract losses reported in Investment Income and Other reconcile with their overall derivative hedging results and the accounting treatment of unrealized gains and losses on trading securities?",
      "answer": "UPS reported a loss of $7 million in 2023 from foreign currency exchange contracts under Investment Income and Other (page 132), which aligns with the $1 million loss reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income related to foreign currency exchange contracts in the hedging relationships (page 131). This reflects the impact of currency fluctuations on UPS's derivative positions. Meanwhile, the accounting policy on page 69 clarifies that unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are also reported in Investment Income and Other, indicating that both realized derivative losses and unrealized market value changes of trading securities directly affect this income line item. Therefore, the volatility in Investment Income and Other is influenced by both derivative hedging outcomes and the fair value adjustments of trading securities.",

      "question": "How do the financial impacts of UPS's Transformation Strategy Costs in 2023 compare to prior years, and how are these costs reflected in both the income statement and the broader financial reporting structure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, UPS incurred $435 million in pre-tax Transformation Strategy Costs, which led to an income tax benefit of $102 million. This contrasts with 2022, where the company recorded $178 million in such costs with a corresponding tax benefit of $36 million. The increase in costs from $178 million to $435 million indicates a significant escalation in transformation-related activities year-over-year. These costs are explicitly itemized in the income tax disclosures and are also reflected in the operating expenses section of the income statement, where Transformation Strategy Costs rose from $121 million in 2022 to $266 million in 2023\u2014a 119.8% increase. Furthermore, the company dedicates a full note (Note 18) to Transformation Strategy Costs in the financial statements, signaling the materiality and ongoing relevance of these expenditures in the company's financial reporting framework.",

      "answer": "The one-time compensation payment of $61 million made in 2023 resulted in an additional income tax benefit of $15 million due to U.S. state and local taxes, as disclosed in the tax discrete items section. In the MD&A section, UPS explains that this payment was excluded from non-GAAP measures to better reflect underlying business performance, aligning with management's perspective. In the operating expense table, this payment is explicitly listed as a separate line item, showing a direct reduction in operating expenses when excluded, which highlights its non-recurring nature and impact on adjusted operating profit.",

        "Hop 1: UPS (page_124) \u2192 One-Time Compensation Payment: The payment of $61 million is linked to an additional income tax benefit of $15 million, calculated at a higher average tax rate due to U.S. state and local taxes.",
        "Hop 2: UPS (page_28) \u2192 One-Time Compensation Payment: UPS explicitly states that this payment was made to certain U.S.-based, non-union part-time supervisors and is excluded from non-GAAP measures to provide a clearer view of underlying business performance.",
        "Hop 3: UPS (page_31) \u2192 One-Time Compensation Payment: The payment is itemized in the operating expense table as a $61 million reduction, directly impacting the adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating profit figures."

      "answer": "UPS reduced the estimated residual value of its MD-11 fleet in 2022, incurring a one-time, non-cash charge that was allocated between its U.S. Domestic Package and International Package segments (page_28). This charge appears in the 2022 operating expenses under 'Long-Lived Asset Estimated Residual Value Changes' at $25 million, with no corresponding charge in 2023 (page_31). The tax implications of this decision are reflected in 2022 as well, with an $18 million impact under 'Long-Lived Asset Estimated Residual Value Changes' in the income tax expense table, again showing no direct impact in 2023 (page_44). This indicates the residual value adjustment was a one-time event in 2022, with no recurrence in 2023, aligning with the company's statement that it excludes such charges when evaluating ongoing business performance.",

        "Hop 2: UPS (page_31) \u2192 Long-Lived Asset Estimated Residual Value Changes: Shows the $25 million charge in 2022 operating expenses under 'Long-Lived Asset Estimated Residual Value Changes,' with no corresponding charge in 2023.",

      "question": "How did the structural changes to UPS's incentive compensation programs in 2022 impact financial performance and tax implications in 2023, and how does this compare to the company's approach to recurring compensation expenses?",
      "answer": "The structural changes to UPS's incentive compensation programs in 2022 resulted in a one-time, non-cash charge of $431 million in 2022, which was excluded from non-GAAP operating profit and adjusted operating expenses in 2023, contributing to a lower adjusted operating expense of $54,555 million. These changes also had a tax impact of $121 million in 2022, which was fully reversed in 2023, reducing the income tax expense impact related to this item to zero. Unlike recurring compensation expenses, UPS treated this as a non-repeating item, aligning it with other one-time adjustments like the 2023 one-time compensation payment of $61 million, reinforcing management's focus on isolating non-recurring items to better reflect ongoing performance.",

        "Hop 1: UPS(page_28) \u2192 Incentive Compensation Program Design Changes: Discloses a one-time, non-cash charge of $431 million in 2022 related to changes in incentive compensation programs, excluded from non-GAAP financial measures to reflect underlying performance.",
        "Hop 2: UPS(page_31) \u2192 Incentive Compensation Program Design Changes: Shows the $431 million charge in 2022 was removed from operating expenses, contributing to a lower adjusted operating expense of $54,555 million in 2023 versus $56,635 million in 2022.",
        "Hop 3: UPS(page_44) \u2192 Incentive Compensation Program Design Changes: Notes that the tax impact of the 2022 incentive compensation program design changes was $121 million, which fully reversed in 2023, resulting in no current-year tax effect."

      "question": "How do MMM's 2023 operating income margin changes reconcile across the Safety and Industrial, and Consumer business segments, considering the impacts of litigation charges, raw material costs, and shifts in consumer spending patterns?",
      "answer": "In 2023, MMM's operating income margins were influenced by several factors across its business segments. In the Safety and Industrial segment, margins increased year-on-year primarily due to lower special-item costs for significant litigation, specifically a pre-tax charge of approximately $1.2 billion in 2022 related to the Combat Arms Earplugs litigation, which was absent in 2023. This improvement was partially offset by lower sales volume, inflation impacts, and China-related challenges. In contrast, the Consumer segment experienced a decrease in operating income margins year-on-year, driven by lower sales volumes, inflation impacts, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, and higher restructuring costs. These negative effects were partially offset by benefits from aggressive spending discipline, pricing, and productivity actions. Shifts in consumer spending patterns also played a role, as consumers moved toward non-discretionary items, negatively impacting sales in home improvement, stationery and office, and home health and auto care categories. Additionally, raw material and logistics costs, along with manufacturing productivity headwinds, further pressured margins across multiple segments, though pricing actions and restructuring efforts helped mitigate these impacts.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: MMM (page_32) \u2192 Operating Income Margins: Margins were negatively impacted by a 2022 asset impairment charge of $0.8 billion related to the exit from PFAS manufacturing, increased raw materials and logistics costs, and manufacturing productivity headwinds, partially offset by price actions and restructuring.",
        "Hop 2: MMM (page_33) \u2192 Operating Income Margins: In the Consumer segment, margins decreased year-on-year due to lower sales volumes, inflation, manufacturing and supply chain headwinds, and higher restructuring costs, partially offset by spending discipline, pricing, and productivity actions. Consumer spending patterns shifted toward non-discretionary items, impacting sales in key categories.",

      "question": "How does 3M's significant increase in 'Other Expense (Income), Net' from $147 million in 2022 to $560 million in 2023 reconcile with its broader financial performance, including operating income losses and pension-related cost allocations?",
      "answer": "The sharp rise in 'Other Expense (Income), Net' from $147 million in 2022 to $560 million in 2023 (as shown in the consolidated income statement on page 44) coincides with a major decline in operating income, which fell to a loss of $9,128 million in 2023 from a profit of $6,539 million in 2022 (page 108). This suggests that non-operating factors, potentially including pension-related costs, played a significant role in worsening financial performance. Supporting this, page 69 reveals that components of net periodic benefit costs\u2014such as those related to pensions\u2014are recorded in 'Other Expense (Income), Net,' indicating that increased pension liabilities or adjustments may have contributed to the spike in this line item. Together, these data points show that 3M\u2019s financial deterioration in 2023 was not only driven by operational underperformance but also by increased non-operating expenses, particularly those tied to long-term benefit obligations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MMM](page_108) \u2192 [Other Expense (Income), Net]: The operating income statement shows a significant drop in profitability, with operating income turning into a loss of $9,128 million in 2023, which contextualizes the impact of non-operating items like 'Other Expense (Income), Net' increasing to $560 million.",
        "Hop 2: [MMM](page_44) \u2192 [Other Expense (Income), Net]: The consolidated income statement explicitly shows the jump in 'Other Expense (Income), Net' from $147 million in 2022 to $560 million in 2023, directly affecting pre-tax income and contributing to the overall net loss.",
        "Hop 3: [MMM](page_69) \u2192 [Other Expense (Income), Net]: The disclosure that pension-related net periodic benefit costs are recorded in 'Other Expense (Income), Net' suggests that rising pension liabilities may have driven part of the increase in this metric."

      "question": "What is the full financial and strategic impact of the 2022 divestiture-related restructuring actions on 3M's corporate cost structure, profitability, and long-term operational efficiency, considering both the GAAP charges, segment-level adjustments, and the workforce implications outlined in the filing?",
      "answer": "The 2022 divestiture-related restructuring actions had a multi-faceted impact on 3M. Financially, the company incurred a $41 million pre-tax charge in 2022, primarily affecting selling, general, and administrative expenses under Corporate and Unallocated, with $10 million remaining accrued by year-end. Operationally, the restructuring targeted approximately 850 global positions to reduce corporate functional costs following the Food Safety Division\u2019s split-off. In terms of profitability, the GAAP operating income for 2022 included this $41 million charge, while adjusted (non-GAAP) figures excluded it, highlighting a strategic effort to reshape margins by streamlining overhead. Segment-level data shows that while the restructuring was not directly tied to business unit performance, it was part of a broader cost rationalization effort that also included other special items like PFAS-related adjustments and litigation costs.",

        "Hop 2: [MMM](page_24) \u2192 [Divestiture-Related Restructuring Actions]: In the 2022 performance summary, the $41 million restructuring charge is listed among special items that reduced GAAP operating income but were excluded from adjusted (non-GAAP) operating income of $6,947 million, showing how management views these costs as non-recurring.",

      "answer": "3M recorded a $36 million pre-tax gain in 2023 from the sale of its dental local anesthetic business, as disclosed in the operating performance section. This gain is also reflected in the Corporate and Unallocated segment under 'Gain on business divestitures' with a corresponding $36 million negative adjustment in the cash flow statement under operating activities, indicating that while the gain contributed positively to operating income, it was non-cash in nature and thus subtracted to reconcile net income to cash flow. The relatively small size of this gain compared to the prior year\u2019s $2.7 billion gain from the Food Safety business split-off highlights a significant decline in divestiture activity and financial impact in 2023.",

      "question": "What is the full financial and strategic context of the $14.785 billion net costs for significant litigation in 2023, considering its impact on operating income, its categorization within corporate special items, and the specific litigation matters that drove this expense?",
      "answer": "The $14.785 billion net costs for significant litigation in 2023 had a substantial negative impact on 3M's operating income, contributing to a total operating loss of $9.128 billion for the year. This expense is categorized under 'Corporate special items' and primarily resulted from pre-tax charges of $10.3 billion related to the PWS Settlement and $4.2 billion tied to the CAE Settlement, both of which are PFAS-related litigation matters discussed in detail in Note 18. Prior to July 2022, costs associated with Combat Arms Earplugs were included in the Safety and Industrial business segment, but during the voluntary Chapter 11 bankruptcy period (July 2022\u2013June 2023), these and other asbestos-related matters were reclassified under Corporate special items. This shift in categorization, along with the magnitude of the litigation charges, explains the significant year-over-year increase in corporate special item net costs and highlights the strategic and financial burden these legal matters placed on the company in 2023.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [MMM](page_108) \u2192 [Net Costs for Significant Litigation]: The financial impact of $14.785 billion in litigation costs is shown in the operating performance table, directly reducing total company operating income to a loss of $9.128 billion in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: [MMM](page_109) \u2192 [Net Costs for Significant Litigation]: The litigation costs are categorized under 'Corporate special items' and include PFAS-related environmental and Combat Arms Earplugs matters, with a note that during the Chapter 11 bankruptcy period, Aearo-related asbestos costs were also included.",
        "Hop 3: [MMM](page_29) \u2192 [Net Costs for Significant Litigation]: The increase in litigation costs is attributed to specific pre-tax charges of $10.3 billion (PWS Settlement) and $4.2 billion (CAE Settlement), and it is clarified that Combat Arms Earplugs costs were previously reported in the Safety and Industrial segment before the bankruptcy period."

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's capital investment in Resource Industries compare with its operational footprint and profitability contribution, and what does this suggest about the strategic positioning of this segment?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar invested $245 million in capital expenditures for Resource Industries in 2023, which is relatively modest compared to larger investments in other segments like Energy & Transportation ($944 million). Despite this, Resource Industries contributed 20.9% of Caterpillar\u2019s total sales profit in 2023, up from 14.8% in 2022, indicating strong profitability. Operationally, Resource Industries is deeply integrated into Caterpillar\u2019s global manufacturing and distribution network, with shared facilities across multiple segments and involvement in parts distribution, technical centers, and manufacturing. This suggests that Resource Industries delivers outsized profitability relative to its capital investment and plays a strategically important role in Caterpillar\u2019s integrated operations.",

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's long-term debt structure across its Machinery, Energy & Transportation and Financial Products segments reflect both the consolidated financial position and the detailed maturity breakdown, and what does this imply about the company's capital allocation and liquidity risk?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's long-term debt due after one year totals $24,472 million as of December 31, 2023, with $8,579 million attributed to the Machinery, Energy & Transportation segment and $15,893 million to the Financial Products segment. This aligns with the consolidated financial position showing the same split (page_61), and further details in the maturity schedule (page_102) reveal a significant portion of this debt matures beyond 2040, including large tranches of debentures at varying interest rates. The Machinery segment's debt includes long-dated, higher-yield instruments like the $246 million 7.375% debentures due in 2097 and $1.7 billion of 3.803% debentures due in 2042, indicating a strategy of locking in long-term financing. Meanwhile, the Financial Products segment carries more standardized medium-term notes, suggesting a different capital structure optimized for financing operations rather than long-term asset backing. Together, this implies Caterpillar is balancing long-duration liabilities with expected cash flows, but the lumpy maturity profile and reliance on long-term debt could pose refinancing or interest rate risks in the future.",

      "answer": "In 2023, Boeing's Defense, Space & Security segment reported an operating loss of $1,764 million, indicating a significant financial challenge. Despite this, the segment maintained a strong backlog of $59,012 million, suggesting substantial future revenue potential. The segment also occupies 27.3 million square feet of facilities (22.8 million owned and 4.4 million leased), which implies considerable fixed costs and infrastructure capacity. The contrast between the segment's loss and its large backlog and facility footprint raises questions about capacity utilization and cost efficiency in converting backlog into profitable operations.",

      "answer": "Boeing's Commercial Airplanes segment reported an operating loss of $1,635 million in 2023, continuing a multi-year trend of losses. Despite these financial challenges, the segment maintains a large physical footprint, with 47.7 million square feet of facilities, primarily owned (39.9 million square feet). At the same time, the unit has a substantial and growing backlog of $440.5 billion as of 2023, up from $329.8 billion in 2022, indicating strong demand that has yet to translate into profitable operations. This combination of significant losses, large infrastructure investment, and growing order backlog suggests operational inefficiencies or production challenges that may be preventing the segment from converting backlog into profitable revenue.",

      "answer": "Boeing incurred abnormal production costs of $1,527 million in 2023, with $1,014 million attributed to the 787 program and $513 million to the 777X program. These costs were primarily due to abnormally low production rates and rework requirements, especially on inventoried aircraft. By the end of 2023, Boeing increased the 787 production rate to 5 per month and resumed 777X production in Q4 2023, signaling operational improvements. However, despite expensing most abnormal costs as incurred, the company still holds $12,384 million in deferred production costs for the 787 program and $1,792 million in deferred costs for the 777X program, which are expected to be recovered through firm orders and future deliveries. This suggests that while abnormal costs have decreased compared to prior years, the financial impact of past production inefficiencies continues to affect the balance sheet and future profitability of these programs.",

        "Hop 2: BA (page_36) \u2192 Abnormal Production Costs: Notes that production rates below 5 per month on the 787 were considered abnormally low, leading to significant abnormal costs through Q3 2023, and that rework on ~50 inventoried aircraft was expected to be completed by end-2024.",

      "question": "How does Honeywell's segment realignment and financial treatment of asbestos liabilities reflect the impact of the $1.3 billion NARCO Buyout in 2023, particularly in terms of segment profit exclusions, liability rollforwards, and future payment obligations?",
      "answer": "Honeywell's 2024 segment realignment excluded certain acquisition-related costs and divestiture-related impairments from segment profit, which would have included the $1.3 billion NARCO Buyout in 2023. The NARCO Buyout was reflected in the 2023 liability rollforward as a $1.325 billion outflow under 'NARCO Buyout' for the Bendix and NARCO entities, reducing the year-end asbestos liability to zero for NARCO. Additionally, the 2024 10-K estimated future asbestos-related payments at $157 million for 2025, noting that the 2023 payments included the NARCO Buyout, which significantly reduced ongoing liability exposure. Together, these perspectives show how the buyout was both strategically and financially managed to reduce future obligations and influence segment performance metrics.",

See Note 4 Repositioning and Other Charges for further discussion of the expense related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n## NOTE 22. SEGMENT FINANCIAL DATA\n\nHoneywell globally manages its business operations through four reportable business segments. Segment information is consistent with how the Chairman and Chief  Executive  Officer,  who  is  the  Company's  chief  operating  decision  maker,  and  management  reviews  the  businesses,  makes  investing  and  resource allocation decisions, and assesses operating performance.\n\nEffectiv e during the first quarter of 2024, the Company realigned certain of its business units comprising its historical Performance M aterials and T echnologies and Safety and Productivity Solutions reportable business segments by forming two new reportable business segments: Industrial A utomation and Energy and Sustainability Solutions. Industrial A utomation includes Sensing and Safety T echnologies, Productivity Solutions and Services, and Warehouse and Workflow Solutions,  previously  included  in  Safety  and  Productivity  Solutions,  in  addition  to  Process  Solutions,  previously  included  in  Performance  M aterials  and Technologies. Energy and Sustainability Solutions includes UOP and A dvanced M aterials, previously included in Performance M aterials and T echnologies. Further, as part of the realignment, the Company renamed its historical A erospace and Honeywell Building T echnologies reportable business segments to Aerospace T echnologies and Building A utomation, respectively . This realignment had no impact on the Company's historical consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Prior period amounts have been recast to conform to current period segment presentation.\n\nEffectiv e during the second quarter of 2024, the Company updated its calculation of segment profit to exclude the impact of amortization expense for acquisitionrelated intangible assets and certain acquisition-related costs. The Company recast historical periods to reflect segment profit under this new basis to facilitate comparability. In the third quarter of 2024, the Company clarified its calculation of segment profit to exclude divestiture-related costs and impairments.\n\nHoneywell's senior management evaluates segment performance based on segment profit. Each segment's profit is measured as segment income (loss) before taxes excluding general corporate unallocated expense, interest and other financial charges, interest income, acquisition-related intangibles, impairment of assets held for sale, stock compensation expense, pension and other postretirement income (expense), repositioning and other charges, and other items within Other (income) expense.\n\n110 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "question": "How does Honeywell's $157 million asbestos-related liability on the 2024 balance sheet reconcile with the company's annual reevaluation methodology for future claim projections and its policy of recording insurance recoveries only when deemed probable?",
      "answer": "Honeywell's $157 million asbestos-related liability as of December 31, 2024, reflects the company's estimate of both pending and future claims related to Bendix, projected through 2059 using historic filing rates and average resolution values. This liability is annually reevaluated based on epidemiological projections, dismissal rates, and tort system trends. Concurrently, the company records insurance recoveries only when deemed probable, factoring in insurer solvency and historical recovery experience, which explains why the recorded recoveries may not fully offset the liability. The methodology described in the notes aligns with the accounting policy of recognizing liabilities when probable and estimable, while insurance recoveries are recognized with caution due to uncertainties in insurer performance and future claim dynamics.",

A lso, if required, a M TM  A djustment will be recorded in the fourth quarter of 2025 in accordance with our pension accounting method as previously described. It is difficult to reliably  forecast or predict whether there will be a M TM  A djustment in 2025, and if one is required, what the magnitude of such adjustment will be. M TM  A djustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the control of the Company such as changes in interest rates and the performance of the financial markets.\n\nAsbestos-Related Liabilities and Insurance Recoveries -The recognition of asbestos-related liabilities relates to a predecessor company , Bendix Friction Materials (Bendix). For Bendix asbestos-related claims, we accrue for the estimated value of pending claims using average resolution values over a defined lookback period. We also accrue for the estimated value of future claims related to Bendix over the full term of epidemiological disease projection through 2059 based on historic and anticipated claims filing experience and dismissal rates, disease classifications, and average resolution values in the tort system over a defined look-back period. We review our valuation assumptions and average resolution values used to estimate the cost of Bendix asserted and unasserted claims during the fourth quarter of each year.\n\nIn connection with the recognition of liabilities for asbestos-related matters, we record asbestos-related insurance recoveries that are deemed probable. In assessing the probability of insurance recovery , we make judgments concerning insurance coverage that we believe are reasonable and consistent with our historical dealings and our knowledge of any pertinent solvency issues surrounding insurers. While the substantial majority of our insurance carriers are solvent, some of our individual  carriers  are  insolvent,  which  was  considered  in  our  analysis  of  probable  recoveries.  Projecting  future  events  is  subject  to  various uncertainties that could cause the insurance recovery on asbestos-related liabilities to be higher or lower than that projected and recorded. Given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections, we reevaluate our projections concerning our probable insurance recoveries considering any changes to the projected liability , our recov ery  ex perience or other relev ant factors that may  impact future insurance recov eries.\n\nSee Note 19 Commitments and Contingencies of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of management's judgments applied in the recognition and measurement of our asbestos-related liabilities and related insurance recoveries.\n\n44\n\nHoneywell International Inc.",

      "answer": "Honeywell's acquisition of Air Products' LNG business for $1,837 million, which was integrated into the Energy and Sustainability Solutions segment, occurred alongside significant repositioning and other charges affecting the same segment. In 2022, the segment incurred $122 million in exit costs related to site transitions, and in the same year, it was significantly impacted by $295 million in Other charges tied to the wind-down of Russian operations, including $63 million in exit costs across all segments. This indicates that while Honeywell is strategically investing in energy transition assets like LNG to grow the segment, it is also managing legacy and restructuring costs that may offset near-term profitability.

Such exit costs incurred in 2024, 2023, and 2022 were $62 million, $62 million, and $63 million, respectively.\n\n## OTHER CHARGES\n\nIn 2022, the Company recognized $295 million of Other charges related to the initial suspension and the wind down of the Company's business and operations in  Russia.  These  costs  impacted  all  reportable  business  segments,  with  the  most  significant  impact  within  the  Industrial  A utomation  and  Energy  and Sustainability Solutions reportable business segments. These charges include costs recorded in Cost of products and services sold, Selling, general and administrative expenses, or Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. Cost of products and services sold includes $65 million primarily related to inventory reserves and the write-down of other assets, Selling, general and administrative includes $185 million primarily related to reserves against outstanding accounts receivable and contract assets, impairment of intangible assets, the write-down of other assets, and employee severance, and Other (income) expense includes $45 million related to foreign exchange revaluation on an intercompany loan with a Russian affiliate, impairment of property , plant and equipment, and expenses for called guarantees. Directly attributable to the Company's wind down of businesses and operations in Russia, but excluded from Other charges, is a $2 million tax valuation allowance recorded to T ax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2024, the Company recognized Other charges of $17 million related to the settlement of a contractual dispute with a Russian entity associated with the Company's suspension and wind down activities in Russia. The charges were recorded in Other (income) expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\n\nGiven the uncertainty inherent in the Company's remaining obligations related to contracts with Russian counterparties, the Company does not believe it is possible to develop estimates of reasonably possible loss in excess of current accruals for these matters (other than as specifically set forth above). Based on available information to date, the Company's estimate of potential future losses or other contingencies related to suspension and wind down activities, including any guarantee payments or any litigation costs or as otherwise related to the Company's wind down in Russia, could adversely affect the Company's consolidated results  of  operations  in  the  periods  recognized  but  would  not  be  material  with  respect  to  the  Company's  consolidated  financial  position.  See  Note  19 Commitments and Contingencies for a discussion of the recognition and measurement of estimate for contingencies.\n\n## 71 Honeywell International Inc.",

      "answer": "Honeywell's 2024 strategic realignment of the Industrial Automation segment, including the integration of the gas detection business into the Process Solutions unit, occurred alongside significant repositioning charges totaling $226 million in 2024, which included $136 million in severance costs and $68 million in exit costs tied to site transitions in that segment. Over the same period, the segment also absorbed $17 million in charges related to the settlement of a Russian contractual dispute, building on prior years' Russia-related costs of $295 million in 2022 and $62 million in 2024, which had previously disproportionately impacted the Industrial Automation segment.

This gain was recognized following the remeasurement of the UPS/IBT Plan triggered by the American Rescue Plan Act (page_28). The financial flexibility provided by this gain supported UPS's strategic decision to divest UPS Freight in April 2021, using the $848 million in proceeds primarily to reduce outstanding indebtedness. This aligns with UPS's broader strategy of disciplined capital allocation and restructuring under its 'Better not Bigger' framework.",

As of March 2021, the actual rate of return on the plan assets was approximately 220 basis points lower than our expected rate of return, primarily due to weak global equity and U.S. bond market performance.\n- Demographic and Other Assumption Changes ($0.1 billion pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation rate increases and rates of termination, retirement and mortality.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($1.8 billion pre-tax gain): This represents the reduction of the liability for potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund.\n\n## 2020 - $6.5 billion pre-tax mark-to-market loss:\n\n- Discount Rates ($6.5 billion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n- Return on Assets ($2.4 billion pre-tax gain): In 2020, the actual rate of return on plan assets was higher than our expected rate of return, primarily due to strong global equity and U.S. bond market performance.\n- Demographic and Other Assumption Changes ($0.4 billion pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation rate increases and rates of termination, retirement and mortality.\n- Coordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund ($2.0 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund.",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are on a journey to execute our Customer First, People Led, Innovation Driven strategy within our Better not Bigger framework. We are focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, growing operating profit and allocating capital in a disciplined fashion. The Customer First component of our strategy focuses on, among other things, enhancing the capabilities that we believe our customers value the most: speed and ease of access to our services. The People Led component of our strategy aims to enhance the employee value proposition. Our Innovation Driven strategic approach utilizes technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network and to enhance the customer experience.\n\nWe have two reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. For the year, we increased average daily volume, revenue per piece and operating margin within global small package operations, with growth led by smalland medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") as we executed on our strategy. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to have, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on our business. We experienced a year-over-year increase in commercial volume as business returned to pre-pandemic levels, while business-to-consumer volume declined, partly due to the surge in e-commerce at the onset of the pandemic. In the second half of the year, COVID-19 resulted in a reduction in the number of flights we operated in Asia relative to our expectations, which contributed to an overall decline in international volume in the fourth quarter. Within Supply Chain Solutions, operating margin increased with demand for our services particularly strong in Forwarding and healthcare logistics, including COVID-19 relief efforts.\n\nThe overall economic environment continues to be challenging. Global supply chain disruption continues, and resulted in capacity constraints that drove higher transportation costs, particularly in our Supply Chain Solutions businesses. Rising inflation and labor market challenges continue to cause wage pressures in certain markets. We continue to monitor the impacts of these external conditions on our business; however, we anticipate that demand for our services will remain strong.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, following enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act (\"ARPA\"), we remeasured the UPS/IBT Full Time Employee Pension Plan. This resulted in a $3.3 billion pre-tax mark-to-market gain in the first quarter. We completed the divestiture of UPS Freight on April 30, 2021, and used the cash proceeds of $848 million to reduce outstanding indebtedness. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $46 million for the year in respect of this transaction. The divestiture triggered a remeasurement of certain of our U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, which had only an immaterial impact on results of operations for the year. For additional information on this divestiture, see note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. Following the divestiture, we renamed our Supply Chain &amp; Freight businesses Supply Chain Solutions.\n\nIn October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform focused on same-day delivery services, for $586 million. The results of Roadie are reported within Supply Chain Solutions. The acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year. See note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction.",

      "question": "How does the growth and composition of UPS's Logistics revenue from Supply Chain Solutions compare across detailed revenue breakdowns, consolidated reporting, and operational performance metrics, particularly considering its year-over-year changes and relative contribution to total revenue?",
      "answer": "UPS's Logistics revenue grew from $4,073 million in 2020 to $4,767 million in 2021, as shown in both the detailed revenue table (page_144) and the consolidated reporting (page_82). The operational performance metrics (page_41) indicate a 17.0% year-over-year increase in Logistics revenue, reflecting strong growth within the Supply Chain Solutions segment. However, while Logistics revenue grew steadily, Freight revenue declined significantly from $3,149 million in 2020 to $1,064 million in 2021, suggesting a strategic shift or market-driven change in the composition of Supply Chain Solutions. Logistics represented a growing portion of the total Supply Chain Solutions revenue, which increased from $15,184 million in 2020 to $17,429 million in 2021, indicating that the growth in Logistics was a key driver within this segment.",

      "question": "How does the growth trajectory of UPS's Forwarding revenue from 2020 to 2021, as shown in the consolidated financial tables, align with the changes in operating metrics and profitability trends within the Supply Chain Solutions segment?",
      "answer": "UPS's Forwarding revenue increased from $6,975 million in 2020 to $9,872 million in 2021, reflecting a 41.5% growth. This growth was part of the broader Supply Chain Solutions segment, which saw total revenue rise from $15,184 million to $17,429 million. Despite this, the segment's operating profit only increased from $357 million to $1,728 million, indicating that while Forwarding revenue grew significantly, it did not fully translate into proportional operating profit growth. Additionally, the segment's operating margin improved from 2.4% to 9.9%, suggesting that the Forwarding business contributed to improved efficiency or cost management.",

      "question": "What strategic rationale might explain FedEx's decision to maintain FedEx Freight as a separate subsidiary while simultaneously executing a $2.5 billion share repurchase in 2024 and affirming the segment's goodwill was not impaired as of 2024?",
      "answer": "FedEx's decision to maintain FedEx Freight as a separate subsidiary while executing significant capital deployment through share repurchases and affirming the segment's goodwill remains unimpaired likely reflects a strategic balance between preserving operational focus in its LTL freight business and returning capital to shareholders. As of page_111, FedEx Freight continues to operate as a distinct segment with discrete financial reporting even after the 'one FedEx' restructuring that unified other segments under Federal Express Corporation. On page_94, the company confirmed that FedEx Freight's estimated fair value exceeded its carrying value during 2024 goodwill impairment testing, indicating financial health and future earnings potential. Meanwhile, page_91 shows that FedEx completed $2.5 billion in share repurchases during 2024, signaling confidence in overall financial stability and a strategic emphasis on optimizing shareholder value. This suggests FedEx views FedEx Freight as a strategically important, standalone business with durable value that supports broader capital allocation decisions.",

The organizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. During the implementation process in 2024, each of our reportable segments continued to have discrete financial information that was regularly reviewed when evaluating performance and making resource allocation decisions, and aligned with our management reporting structure and our internal financial reporting. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, our reportable segments will be Federal Ex press Corporation and FedEx Freight. Additionally, the results of FedEx Custom Critical, Inc. will be included in the FedEx Freight segment instead of the Federal Express segment. This change was made to reflect our new management reporting structure. Prior-year amounts will be revised to reflect this presentation.\n\nReferences to our transportation segments include, collectively, the FedEx Express segment, the FedEx Ground segment, and the FedEx Freight segment.\n\n## FedEx Services Segment\n\nDuring 2024, 2023, and 2022, the FedEx Services segment operated combined sales, marketing, administrative, and information-technology functions in shared services operations for U.S. customers of our major business units and certain back-office support to our operating segments which allowed us to obtain synergies from the combination of these functions. For the international regions of FedEx Express, some of these functions were performed on a regional basis and reported by FedEx Express in their natural ex pense line items.",

We evaluated these reporting units during the fourth quarters of 2024 and 2023 and the estimated fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded their carrying values as of the end of 2024 and 2023; therefore, we do not believe that any of these reporting units were impaired as of the balance sheet dates.\n\nIn connection with our annual impairment testing of goodwill conducted in the fourth quarter of 2023, we recorded an impairment charge of $36 million for all of the goodwill attributable to our FedEx Dataworks, Inc. ('FedEx Dataworks') reporting unit. The key factors contributing to the goodwill impairment were underperformance of the ShopRunner business during 2023, including base business erosion, and the failure to attain the level of operating synergies and revenue and profit growth anticipated at the time of acquisition. Based on these factors, our outlook for the business changed in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nOTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nWe apply the measurement alternative to all other investments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value. Under the measurement alternative these equity securities are accounted for at cost, with adjustments for observable changes in prices and impairments recognized in 'Other income (expense)' on our consolidated statements of income. We perform a qualitative assessment each reporting period to evaluate whether these equity securities are impaired. Our assessment includes a review of recent operating results and trends and other publicly available data. If an investment is impaired, we write it down to its estimated fair value.\n\nInvestments in debt securities, which are considered short-term investments, are classified as 'available-for-sale' and are carried at fair value. Realized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt securities are included in net income, while unrealized gains and losses, net of tax , are included in our consolidated balance sheet as a component of AOCL.\n\nInvestments in equity securities and debt securities are recorded within 'Other assets' and 'Prepaid expenses and other,' respectively, on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. The accounting guidance related to share-based payments requires recognition of compensation expense for stock-based awards using a fair value method. We use the Black-Scholes option pricing model to calculate the fair value of stock options. The value of restricted stock awards and restricted stock units ('RSUs') are based on the stock price of the award on the grant date. We record stock-based compensation expense in the 'Salaries and employee benefits' caption in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. We issue new shares or treasury shares from stock repurchases to cover employee stock option exercises and restricted stock grants. Shares not issued for restricted stock grants are available to be issued for stock option grants.\n\nTREASURY SHARES. In December 2021, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $5 billion of FedEx common stock. As of February 29, 2024, $564 million remained available to be used for repurchases under the 2021 program. In March 2024, our Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program for additional repurchases of up to $5 billion of FedEx common stock.\n\nDuring 2024, we completed four accelerated share repurchase ('ASR') transactions with banks to repurchase 9.8 million shares of FedEx common stock at an average price of $255.34 per share for a total of $2.5 billion. During 2023, we repurchased 9.2 million shares of FedEx  common stock at an average price of $163.39 per share for a total of $1.5 billion.\n\nThe final number of shares delivered upon settlement of the ASR agreements was determined based on a discount to the volume-weighted average price of our stock during the term of the transaction. The repurchased shares were accounted for as a reduction to common stockholders' investment in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and resulted in a reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.\n\nIn June 2024, we executed an ASR agreement with two banks as part of the 2021 and 2024 repurchase programs to repurchase $1 billion of our common stock with a completion date of no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. As of July 15, 2024, approx imately $4.1 billion remained available for repurchases under the 2024 repurchase program.\n\nShares under the 2024 repurchase program may be repurchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. The timing and volume of repurchases are at the discretion of management, based on the capital needs of the business, the market price of FedEx common stock, and general market conditions. No time limits were set for the completion of the programs, however the programs may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n\nDIVIDENDS DECLARED PER COMMON SHARE. On June 10, 2024, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.38 per share of common stock. The dividend was paid on July 9, 2024 to stockholders of record as of the close of business on June 24, 2024. Each quarterly dividend payment is subject to review and approval by our Board of Directors, and we evaluate our dividend payment amount on an annual basis. There are no material restrictions on our ability to declare dividends, nor are there any material restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends, loans, or advances.\n\nBUSINESS OPTIMIZATION AND REALIGNMENT COSTS . In the second quarter of 2023, FedEx announced DRIVE, a comprehensive program to improve the company's long-term profitability. This program includes a business optimization plan to drive efficiency among our transportation segments, lower our overhead and support costs, and transform our digital capabilities. We have commenced our plan to consolidate our sortation facilities and equipment, reduce pickup-anddelivery routes, and optimize our enterprise linehaul network by moving beyond discrete collaboration to an end-to-end optimized network through Network 2.0, the multi-year effort to improve the efficiency with which FedEx picks up, transports, and delivers packages in the U.S. and Canada.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, we announced one FedEx, a consolidation plan to ultimately bring FedEx Ground and FedEx Services into Federal Express Corporation, becoming a single company operating a unified, fully integrated air-ground express network under the respected FedEx brand. FedEx Freight continues to provide LTL freight transportation services as a separate subsidiary. The",

      "answer": "FedEx projects a $652 million payout for postretirement healthcare plans between 2030 and 2034 (page_111), indicating significant long-term liability. This aligns with the structural changes outlined in 2018, where retiree healthcare coverage was closed to most new employees, likely aimed at limiting future obligations (page_105). However, as of May 31, 2024, the funded status of these plans (page_109) reveals how much of this liability is currently backed by assets, providing insight into the company's preparedness to meet these future commitments.

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nPENSION PLANS . Our largest pension plan covers certain U.S. employees age 21 and over, with at least one year of service. Pension benefits for most employees are accrued under a cash balance formula we call the Portable Pension Account ('PPA'). Under the PPA, the retirement benefit is expressed as a dollar amount in a notional account that grows with annual credits based on pay, age and years of credited service, and interest on the notional account balance. The PPA benefit is payable as a lump sum or an annuity at retirement at the election of the employee. The plan interest credit rate varies from year to year based on a U.S. Treasury index. Prior to 2009, certain employees earned benefits using a traditional pension formula (based on average earnings and years of service). Benefits under this formula were capped on May 31, 2008 for most employees.\n\nWe also sponsor or participate in nonqualified benefit plans covering certain of our U.S. employee groups and other pension plans covering certain of our international employees. The international defined benefit pension plans provide benefits primarily based on earnings and years of service and are funded in compliance with local laws and practices. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit pension plans in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn 2020, we announced the closing of our U.S.-based defined benefit pension plans to new non-union employees hired on or after January 1, 2020. We introduced an all-401(k) plan retirement benefit structure for eligible employees with a higher company match of up to 8% across all U.S.-based operating companies in 2022. During calendar 2021, current eligible employees under the PPA pension formula were given a one-time option to continue to be eligible for pension compensation credits under the existing PPA formula and remain in the existing 401(k) plan with its company match of up to 3.5%, or to cease receiving compensation credits under the PPA and move to the new 401(k) plan with the higher match of up to 8%. Changes to the new 401(k) plan structure became effective January 1, 2022. See Note 1 for additional information on expected amendments to our pension plan offered to FedEx Express pilots.\n\nPOSTRETIREMENT HEALTHCARE PLANS. Certain of our subsidiaries offer medical, dental, and vision coverage to eligible U.S. retirees and their eligible dependents and a small number of international employees. U.S. employees covered by the principal plan become eligible for these benefits at age 55 and older, if they have permanent, continuous service of at least 10 years after attainment of age 45 if hired prior to January 1, 1988, or at least 20 years after attainment of age 35 if hired on or after January 1, 1988.\n\nThe U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit is a lump-sum benefit in a notional retiree health reimbursement account ('HRA') for eligible participants. The HRA is available to reimburse a participant for qualifying healthcare premium costs and limits the company liability to the HRA account balance. The amount of the credit is based on age at retirement. Retiree health coverage was closed to most new employees hired on or after January 1, 2018.\n\nPENSION PLAN ASSUMPTIONS. The accounting for pension and postretirement healthcare plans includes numerous assumptions, such as: discount rates; expected long-term investment returns on plan assets; future salary increases; employee turnover; mortality; and retirement ages.\n\nWeighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and net periodic benefit cost of our plans are as follows:\n\n",

      "question": "How did FedEx's business realignment costs evolve from the European restructuring efforts to 2024, and how does this evolution reflect in their income statement categorization alongside other strategic cost initiatives like DRIVE and Network 2.0?",
      "answer": "FedEx's business realignment costs originated from the European restructuring tied to the TNT Express integration, which cumulatively cost approximately $430 million pre-tax, with $36 million incurred in 2023 alone. These costs were primarily related to employee severance arrangements and were completed by 2023. In contrast, 2024 saw no business realignment costs, but the company incurred $582 million in business optimization costs, primarily linked to professional fees and severance related to the DRIVE transformation program and Network 2.0 implementation across Corporate, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. On the income statement, these business optimization costs were explicitly called out as a separate line item, distinct from other charges like goodwill impairments and FedExGround legal matters. This categorization reflects a strategic shift from past restructuring efforts in Europe to a broader, forward-looking transformation agenda aimed at improving long-term profitability through operational redesign and network optimization.",

          "chunk_text": "## FEDEX CORPORATION\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\norganizational redesign was implemented in phases with full legal implementation effective June 1, 2024. One FedEx will help facilitate our DRIVE transformation program to improve long-term profitability.\n\nFedEx is making progress with Network 2.0, as the company has implemented Network 2.0 optimization in more than 50 locations in the U.S. Contracted service providers will handle the pickup and delivery of packages in some locations while employee couriers will handle others.\n\nWe incurred costs associated with our business optimization activities of $582 million ($444 million, net of tax , or $1.77 per diluted share) in 2024 and $273 million ($209 million, net of tax , or $0.81 per diluted share) in 2023. The costs incurred in 2024 were primarily related to professional fees and severance, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations, FedEx Express, and FedEx Ground. The costs incurred in 2023 were primarily related to consulting services, severance, professional fees, and idling our operations in Russia, and are included in Corporate, other, and eliminations and FedEx Express. We did not incur costs associated with our business optimization activities in 2022.\n\nIn 2021, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe related to the network integration of TNT Express. The plan affected approximately 5,000 employees in Europe across operational teams and back-office functions and was completed during 2023. We incurred costs of $36 million ($27 million, net of tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) in 2023 and $278 million ($214 million, net of tax , or $0.80 per diluted share) in 2022 associated with our business realignment activities. These costs are related to certain employee severance arrangements. Payments under this program totaled approximately $118 million in 2023 and approximately $225 million in 2022. The cumulative pre-tax cost of our business realignment activities was approximately $430 million. We did not incur any costs related to business realignment activities in 2024.\n\nIn June 2024, FedEx Express announced a workforce reduction plan in Europe as part of its ongoing measures to reduce structural costs. The plan will impact between 1,700 and 2,000 employees in Europe across back-office and commercial functions. The execution of the plan is subject to a consultation process that is expected to occur over an 18-month period in accordance with local country processes and regulations. We expect the pre-tax cost of the severance benefits and legal and professional fees to be provided under and related to the plan to range from $250 million to $375 million in cash ex penditures. These charges are expected to be incurred through fiscal 2026 and will be classified as business optimization ex penses.\n\nUSE OF ESTIMATES . The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenue and expenses, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities. Management makes its best estimate of the ultimate outcome for these items based on historical trends and other information available when the financial statements are prepared. Changes in estimates are recognized in accordance with the accounting rules for the estimate, which is typically in the period when new information becomes available to management. Areas where the nature of the estimate makes it reasonably possible that actual results could materially differ from amounts estimated include self-insurance accruals, retirement plan obligations, long-term incentive accruals, tax  liabilities, loss contingencies, litigation claims, impairment assessments on long-lived assets (including goodwill) that rely on projections of future cash flows, and purchase price allocations.\n\n## NOTE 2: RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\n\nNew accounting rules and disclosure requirements can significantly affect our reported results and the comparability of our financial statements. We believe the following new accounting guidance is relevant to the readers of our financial statements.\n\n## Recently Adopted Accounting Standards\n\nIn September 2022, the Financial Accounting Standards Board ('FASB') issued Accounting Standards Update ('ASU') 2022-04, Liabilities-Supplier Finance Programs (Topic 405-50): Disclosure of Supplier Finance Program Obligations, which requires a buyer in a supplier finance program (e.g., reverse factoring) to disclose sufficient information about the program to allow a user of financial statements to understand the program's nature, activity during the period, changes from period to period, and potential magnitude. The amendments do not affect the recognition, measurement, or financial statement presentation of obligations covered by supplier finance programs. We adopted this standard effective June 1, 2023 (fiscal 2024). The adoption of this standard did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements or internal controls. See Note 1 for further discussion about our supplier finance program obligations.",

However, in the statement of cash flows, the net costs related to business optimization and realignment were only $26 million in 2024, indicating that the majority of these expenses were non-cash or had not yet resulted in cash outflows. Additionally, the segment-level operating expense table introduced a separate line item for business optimization costs at $108 million in 2024, which was absent in 2023, suggesting a strategic realclassification or a new initiative within specific business units.

      "answer": "The 10% decrease in Rentals and Landing Fees at FedEx Express in 2024 was primarily driven by fewer aircraft leases due to lower volumes, aligning with the company's broader cost-cutting efforts. This reduction is consistent with the overall 4% decline in total operating expenses across FedEx, as seen in the consolidated operating expense table, where Rentals and Landing Fees dropped from $4,738 million in 2023 to $4,571 million in 2024. Additionally, this trend mirrors the FedEx Ground segment's 10% decrease in its own Rentals and Landing Fees, reflecting a coordinated reduction in aircraft-related costs across segments, likely due to strategic network optimization and lower overall air transport demand.",

          "chunk_text": "## FedEx Express Segment Operating Income\n\nFedEx Express segment operating income decreased 27% in 2024 primarily due to reduced revenue, partially offset by lower operating expenses. Operating expenses declined in 2024 as a result of continued benefits from DRIVE initiatives that drove a reduction in our permanent cost structure, as well as lower volumes. These initiatives include network rationalization through structural flight takedowns and route optimization, along with improvements in hub sort efficiency. Currency exchange rates had a positive effect on revenue and a negative effect on expenses and operating income in 2024.\n\nFuel expense decreased 20% in 2024 due to decreases in fuel prices and usage. Other operating expense decreased 8% in 2024 primarily due to lower bad debt expense and lower outside service contracts expense resulting from a decrease in temporary labor usage. Fewer aircraft leases as a result of lower volumes drove a decrease in rentals and landing fees of 10% in 2024. Maintenance and repairs expense decreased 5% in 2024 primarily due to lower aircraft maintenance resulting from an increase in aircraft temporarily parked. Salaries and employee benefits ex pense decreased 1% primarily due to decreased staffing to align with lower volume, partially offset by higher wage rates and increased variable incentive compensation.\n\nFedEx Express segment results in 2024 include $157 million of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines and business optimization costs of $143 million associated with our plan to drive efficiency and lower our overhead and support costs. FedEx Express segment results in 2023 include $70 million of asset impairment charges associated with the decision to permanently retire certain aircraft and related engines, $36 million associated with our workforce reduction plan in Europe, and $11 million of business optimization costs which includes costs associated with idling our business in Russia. See the 'Business Optimization and Realignment Costs' and 'Goodwill and Other Asset Impairment Charges' sections of this MD&amp;A for more information.\n\nIn July 2023, FedEx Express's pilots failed to ratify the tentative successor agreement that was approved by the Air Line Pilots Association, International's FedEx Master Executive Council in the prior month. The ongoing bargaining process has no effect on our operations. For more information, see Note 1 of the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n\n## FEDEX GROUND SEGMENT\n\nDuring 2024 and 2023, FedEx Ground service offerings included day-certain delivery to businesses in the U.S. and Canada and to 100% of U.S. residences.

      "answer": "The 8% decline in freight car velocity in 2021 negatively impacted Union Pacific's service execution, as evidenced by an 8-point drop in Trip Plan Compliance for both Intermodal and Manifest/Autos, which is directly tied to the Precision Scheduled Railroading (PSR) framework aimed at delivering customer-centered operational excellence. This slower velocity increased freight car dwell time and reduced train speed, contributing to a worse operating ratio of 57.2% (vs. 59.9% in 2020), despite record financial results. Additionally, slower freight car velocity directly affected cost management, as it led to a volume-driven increase in freight car rent expense. These dynamics reveal that under PSR, service execution and cost efficiency are tightly interlinked\u2014operational disruptions that slow velocity not only degrade service reliability but also inflate variable costs such as freight car rent, directly impacting financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "Fellow Shareholders:\n\nUnion Pacific demonstrated again in 2021 that our team is 'best in class' as we navigated challenges from the pandemic and numerous operational disruptions. The pandemic continued to impact our daily lives and disrupt supply chains in significant ways. Despite these wide-ranging impacts, the Union Pacific team achieved record financial results. In 2021, we are reporting earnings per share of $9.95, which is a 26% increase versus 2020. Total  volumes  increased  4%  versus  2020,  as  our  economy  continued  to  recover  from  the  pandemic  impacts. Operating ratio was a record 57.2%, 270 basis points better than 2020's 59.9% demonstrating continued focus on efficient  operations.  2020  results  were  negatively  impacted  by  a  one-time  $278  million  non-cash  impairment charge that reduced earnings per share by $0.31 and increased operating ratio by 140 basis points.\n\nSafety is foundational to everything we do at Union Pacific. 2021 safety results did not meet our expectations. In 2022, we are continuing to engage external experts to help us get back on track to world class industrial safety performance. We are implementing more effective ways to coach, train, and root-cause analyze, all while building a  stronger,  deeper  safety  culture.  Nothing  is  more  important  than  making  sure  every  employee  returns  home safely.\n\nDuring  2021,  we  rolled  out  a  new  strategic  plan  we  call, ' Serve, Grow, Win, Together. ' The essence of our strategy is unchanged; however, as our culture evolves, it's imperative that we have a strategic plan that clearly defines our path to long-term sustainable growth.\n\nEverything  we  do  starts  with Serve and  the  transportation products  we  provide  our  customers.  Precision  Scheduled Railroading (PSR) is the foundation for delivering customercentered operational excellence and creating a more resilient and agile service product. In 2021, weather, wildfires, supply chain disruptions, and pandemic impacts to crew availability all impeded our ability to further improve our service product. Freight car velocity was down 8% versus 2020, lowering Trip Plan  Compliance  for  both  Intermodal  and  Manifest/Autos  8 points. Beyond reliable service, our customers want 'greener' transportation options. Every carload of freight we take  off  the  highway  saves  fuel,  lowers  emissions,  and reduces highway congestion. We took steps toward our longterm emission reduction goals by achieving a best-ever fuel consumption  rate,  improving  1%  versus  2020,  helping  our customers eliminate roughly 23 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by choosing rail versus truck.\n\nTo support our service product, we  continue  to  make significant  investments  in  our  infrastructure.  In  2021,  we invested  approximately  $3.0  billion,  completing  15  siding extensions, opening pop-up intermodal terminals in the Twin Cities, MN, and West Colton, CA, modernizing 100 locomotives, and hardening our infrastructure.  We  also invested  in  energy  management  systems  to  reduce  fuel consumption and the resulting carbon emissions.\n\nThese  investments  also  underpin  the  next  tenet  of  our  strategy  Grow .  We  believe  we  have  the  best  rail franchise  in  North America.  By  providing  a  quality  service  product,  along  with  the  lowest  cost  structure  in  the industry,  we  are  well  positioned  to  handle  more  business  for  new  and  existing  customers.  We  see  many opportunities to grow, whether by providing more services for our customers or by expanding our reach through new  transload  facilities  or  pop-up  intermodal  terminals.  Improving  the  customer  experience  is  critical  and technology plays a key role. Our industry leading practices provide our customers with application programming interfaces  (API),  with  over  50  services  launched,  we  are  integrating  deeper  into  our  customers'  systems  and supply chains. And our team is winning in the marketplace! We welcomed new customers in 2021, are onboarding more in 2022, and already setting the stage for a great 2023 with a significant domestic intermodal win.\n\nSuccessful  execution  of  our  plans  to  'Serve'  and  'Grow'  leads  to Win .  For  our  shareholders,  winning  means generating  best-in-industry  cash  returns.  In  2021,  we  paid  dividends  of  $2.8  billion,  which  included  two  10% dividend increases during the year. In addition, we repurchased 33 million Union Pacific shares, decreasing our full-year  average  share  count  3%.  Combining  dividends  and  share  repurchases,  Union  Pacific  returned  $10.1 billion to our shareholders in 2021.",

          "chunk_text": "\n[a] 2019 has been recast to conform to the current year presentation which reflects minor refinements.\n\n[b] As reported to the STB.\n\nGross  and  Revenue  Ton-Miles -  Gross  ton-miles  are  calculated  by  multiplying  the  weight  of  loaded  and  empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the  number  of  tariff  miles.  In  2021,  gross  ton-miles  and  revenue  ton-miles  increased  6%  and  7%,  respectively, compared to 2020, driven by a 4% increase in carloadings. Changes in commodity mix drove the variance in yearover-year increases between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles, and carloads (smaller increases in our intermodal and  automotive  shipments,  which  are  generally  lighter,  coupled  with  higher  increases  in  grain  and  industrial shipments, which are generally heavier).\n\nFreight Car Velocity - Freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network. The two key drivers  of  this  metric  are  the  speed  of  the  train  between  terminals  (average  train  speed)  and  the  time  a  rail  car spends at the terminals (average terminal dwell time). Train speed slowed and terminal dwell increased in 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 as the network handled additional volume and was impacted by weather and wildfire-related challenges, bridge outages caused by the California wildfires, other incidents causing delays on the network, and global supply chain disruptions. Continued implementation of our operating plan helped to partially offset these impacts.\n\nLocomotive  Productivity -  Locomotive  productivity  is  gross  ton-miles  per  average  daily  locomotive  horsepower. Locomotive productivity decreased 3% in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by the increased active fleet needed to handle  the  4%  volume  increase  as  well  as  manage  network  disruptions,  partially  offset  by  transportation  plan changes.\n\nTrain  Length -  Train  length  is  the  average  maximum  train  length  on  a  route  measured  in  feet.  Our  train  length increased 6% compared to 2020 as a result of blending service products and transportation plan changes designed to improve overall operational efficiency. However, in the second half of the year, train length declined slightly from the first half of 2021 due to California wildfire bridge outage reroutes in the third quarter and operational challenges in the fourth quarter.\n\nCar Trip Plan Compliance - Car trip plan compliance is the percentage of cars delivered on time in accordance with our  original  trip  plan.  Our  network  trip  plan  compliance  is  broken  into  the  intermodal  and  manifest/automotive products.  Intermodal  trip  plan  compliance  deteriorated  in  2021  compared  to  2020  primarily  due  to  global  supply chain disruptions. Manifest/automotive trip plan compliance deteriorated in 2021 compared to 2020 as our network slowed  because  of  the  outages  and  incidents  described  above  that  required  increased  resource  allocation  and rebalancing.\n\nWorkforce  Productivity -  Workforce  productivity  is  average  daily  car  miles  per  employee.  Workforce  productivity improved 10%, reaching an all-time record as employee counts were down 3% compared to 2020, while average daily car miles increased 6%. Productivity initiatives and a smaller capital workforce offset higher train and engine employee  levels due to weather and wildfire-related challenges, network disruptions,  and  reduced  crew utilization keeping total employee levels lower than 2020.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating expenses increased $767 million in 2021 compared to  2020  driven  by  higher  fuel  prices,  volume-related  costs, inflation,  higher  casualty  costs,  2020  management  actions, weather and wildfire-related expenses, incentive compensation,  and  higher  state  and  local  taxes.  Partially offsetting  these  increases  compared  to  2020  include  a  $278 million  impairment  charge  in  2020,  productivity  initiatives,  a one-time  bonus  payment  for  agreement  employees  in  2020, and lower severance costs. Full year results of 2021 and 2020 both include a reduction of expense for weather and wildfirerelated insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n2021 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits -  Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension  costs,  and  incentive  costs.  In  2021,  expenses  increased  4%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  volume  related costs,  inflation,  2020  management  actions  responding  to  the  sharp  decline  in  volume  (temporary  unpaid  leave, salary reductions, and shop closures), incentive compensation, and higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3% compared to 2020 despite a 4% volume increase, a 2020 one-time bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic, and lower severance costs.\n\nDepreciation -  The  majority  of  depreciation  relates  to  road  property,  including  rail,  ties,  ballast,  and  other  track material. Depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nFuel -  Fuel  includes  locomotive  fuel  and  gasoline  for  highway  and  non-highway  vehicles  and  heavy  equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.23 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2021, compared  to  $1.50  per  gallon  in  2020,  increased  expenses  $668  million  (excluding  any  impact  from  increased volume year-over-year). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased  from  outside  contractors  and  other  service  providers  (including  equipment  maintenance  and  contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad's lines, structures, and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile  maintenance  expenses;  and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  services  and  materials  increased  3%  in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation, higher professional services expense, volume-related costs associated with  our  intermodal  business,  higher  costs  due  to  weather  and  wildfire-related  events,  increased  locomotive  and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network, and higher costs for transportation of train crews.\n\nEquipment  and  Other  Rents -  Equipment  and  other  rents  expense  primarily  includes  rental  expense  that  the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases;  and  office  and  other  rent  expenses,  offset  by  equity  income  from  certain  equity  method  investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 2% compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and  higher  equity  income  from  our  investment  in  TTX  Company,  partially  offset  by  increased  freight  car  rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity.\n\nOther - Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal  injury,  environmental,  employee  travel,  telephone  and  cellular,  computer  software,  bad  debt,  and  other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a $278 million noncash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment in 2020, lower write-offs of cancelled in-progress capital  projects,  2020  lease  impairments,  and  higher  equity  income.  Partially  offsetting  these  decreases  were increased casualty expenses, including personal injury, damaged freight, and environmental, and higher state and local  taxes.  Both  periods  in  2021  and  2020  included  a  reduction  of  expense  for  weather  and  wildfire-related insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's improvement in operating ratio from 2020 to 2021 reconcile with the decline in operational efficiency metrics like freight car velocity and trip plan compliance, and what role did the one-time 2020 impairment play in this financial performance shift?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific's operating ratio improved from 59.9% in 2020 to 57.2% in 2021, driven in part by a one-time $278 million non-cash impairment in 2020 that increased the prior year\u2019s operating ratio by 140 basis points. However, during the same period, key operational efficiency metrics like freight car velocity declined by 8% and trip plan compliance for intermodal and manifest/autos dropped by 8 percentage points, suggesting operational challenges persisted. This indicates that while financial efficiency improved due to cost controls, productivity initiatives, and the impairment adjustment, actual service delivery and asset utilization faced headwinds, limiting the full realization of operational improvements.",

        "Hop 1: [UNP](page_41) \u2192 [Operating Ratio]: The operating ratio of 57.2% in 2021 was an all-time record and improved 2.7 points from 2020, attributed to core pricing gains, productivity initiatives, and traffic mix, partially offset by higher fuel prices and inflation.",
        "Hop 2: [UNP](page_40) \u2192 [Operating Ratio]: The operating ratio improved from 59.9% in 2020 to 57.2% in 2021, a 2.7 percentage point decrease, as shown in the financial table.",
        "Hop 3: [UNP](page_4) \u2192 [Operating Ratio]: The 2021 operating ratio improvement was partly due to the absence of a one-time $278 million non-cash impairment in 2020, which had increased the 2020 operating ratio by 140 basis points, while operational metrics like freight car velocity and trip plan compliance declined."

          "chunk_text": "Fellow Shareholders:\n\nUnion Pacific demonstrated again in 2021 that our team is 'best in class' as we navigated challenges from the pandemic and numerous operational disruptions. The pandemic continued to impact our daily lives and disrupt supply chains in significant ways. Despite these wide-ranging impacts, the Union Pacific team achieved record financial results. In 2021, we are reporting earnings per share of $9.95, which is a 26% increase versus 2020. Total  volumes  increased  4%  versus  2020,  as  our  economy  continued  to  recover  from  the  pandemic  impacts. Operating ratio was a record 57.2%, 270 basis points better than 2020's 59.9% demonstrating continued focus on efficient  operations.  2020  results  were  negatively  impacted  by  a  one-time  $278  million  non-cash  impairment charge that reduced earnings per share by $0.31 and increased operating ratio by 140 basis points.\n\nSafety is foundational to everything we do at Union Pacific. 2021 safety results did not meet our expectations. In 2022, we are continuing to engage external experts to help us get back on track to world class industrial safety performance. We are implementing more effective ways to coach, train, and root-cause analyze, all while building a  stronger,  deeper  safety  culture.  Nothing  is  more  important  than  making  sure  every  employee  returns  home safely.\n\nDuring  2021,  we  rolled  out  a  new  strategic  plan  we  call, ' Serve, Grow, Win, Together. ' The essence of our strategy is unchanged; however, as our culture evolves, it's imperative that we have a strategic plan that clearly defines our path to long-term sustainable growth.\n\nEverything  we  do  starts  with Serve and  the  transportation products  we  provide  our  customers.  Precision  Scheduled Railroading (PSR) is the foundation for delivering customercentered operational excellence and creating a more resilient and agile service product. In 2021, weather, wildfires, supply chain disruptions, and pandemic impacts to crew availability all impeded our ability to further improve our service product. Freight car velocity was down 8% versus 2020, lowering Trip Plan  Compliance  for  both  Intermodal  and  Manifest/Autos  8 points. Beyond reliable service, our customers want 'greener' transportation options. Every carload of freight we take  off  the  highway  saves  fuel,  lowers  emissions,  and reduces highway congestion. We took steps toward our longterm emission reduction goals by achieving a best-ever fuel consumption  rate,  improving  1%  versus  2020,  helping  our customers eliminate roughly 23 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions by choosing rail versus truck.\n\nTo support our service product, we  continue  to  make significant  investments  in  our  infrastructure.  In  2021,  we invested  approximately  $3.0  billion,  completing  15  siding extensions, opening pop-up intermodal terminals in the Twin Cities, MN, and West Colton, CA, modernizing 100 locomotives, and hardening our infrastructure.  We  also invested  in  energy  management  systems  to  reduce  fuel consumption and the resulting carbon emissions.\n\nThese  investments  also  underpin  the  next  tenet  of  our  strategy  Grow .  We  believe  we  have  the  best  rail franchise  in  North America.  By  providing  a  quality  service  product,  along  with  the  lowest  cost  structure  in  the industry,  we  are  well  positioned  to  handle  more  business  for  new  and  existing  customers.  We  see  many opportunities to grow, whether by providing more services for our customers or by expanding our reach through new  transload  facilities  or  pop-up  intermodal  terminals.  Improving  the  customer  experience  is  critical  and technology plays a key role. Our industry leading practices provide our customers with application programming interfaces  (API),  with  over  50  services  launched,  we  are  integrating  deeper  into  our  customers'  systems  and supply chains. And our team is winning in the marketplace! We welcomed new customers in 2021, are onboarding more in 2022, and already setting the stage for a great 2023 with a significant domestic intermodal win.\n\nSuccessful  execution  of  our  plans  to  'Serve'  and  'Grow'  leads  to Win .  For  our  shareholders,  winning  means generating  best-in-industry  cash  returns.  In  2021,  we  paid  dividends  of  $2.8  billion,  which  included  two  10% dividend increases during the year. In addition, we repurchased 33 million Union Pacific shares, decreasing our full-year  average  share  count  3%.  Combining  dividends  and  share  repurchases,  Union  Pacific  returned  $10.1 billion to our shareholders in 2021.",

      "answer": "Union Pacific reported freight revenues from its Mexico business of $2.3 billion in 2019, $2.1 billion in 2020, and $2.4 billion in 2021, showing a decline in 2020 followed by a rebound in 2021. This evolution aligns with the performance of specific commodity groups: the Bulk segment, which includes grain and fertilizer, saw a 12% increase in 2021 compared to 2020, driven in part by grain exports connected to Mexican export terminals. Meanwhile, the Premium segment, which includes automotive and intermodal shipments, grew by 11% in 2021 versus 2020, with automotive revenues increasing by 5% year-over-year. The Railroad's network connects to six major Mexico gateways and serves vehicle assembly plants, supporting both finished vehicle and automotive parts shipments to and from Mexico.

We serve  the  Western  two-thirds  of  the  country  and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers  to  move  freight  to  and  from  the  Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic moves through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders.  In  2021,  we  generated  freight  revenues totaling $20.2 billion from the following three commodity groups:\n\n## 2021 Freight Revenues\n\nBulk - The Company's Bulk shipments consist of grain and grain products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated, and coal and renewables. In 2021, this group generated 33% of our freight revenues. We access most major grain markets, connecting the Midwest and Western U.S. producing areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast  ports  as  well  as  Mexico.  We  also  serve  significant  domestic  markets,  including  grain  processors,  animal feeders, and ethanol producers in the Midwest and West. Fertilizer movements originate in the Gulf Coast region, Midwest, western U.S., and Canada (through interline access) for delivery to major agricultural users in those areas as  well  as  abroad.  The  Railroad's  network  supports  the  transportation  of  coal  shipments  to  independent  and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the U.S. Through interchange gateways and ports, UPRR's reach extends to eastern U.S. utilities as well as to Mexico and other international destinations. Coal traffic originating in the Powder River Basin (PRB) area of Wyoming is the largest portion of the Railroad's coal business. Renewable  shipments  for  customers  committed  to  sustainability  consist  primarily  of  biomass  exports  and  wind turbine components.\n\nIndustrial - Our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and  destination  points  throughout  North  America.  The  Industrial  group  consists  of  several  categories,  including construction, industrial chemicals, plastics, forest products, specialized products (primarily waste, salt, and roofing), metals and ores, petroleum, liquid petroleum gases (LPG), soda ash, and sand. Transportation of these products accounted  for  36%  of  our  freight  revenues  in  2021.  Commercial,  residential,  and  governmental  infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel, aggregates, cement, and wood products. Industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel, nonferrous materials, minerals, and other raw materials.\n\nThe industrial chemicals market consists of a vast number of chemical compounds that support the manufacturing of  more  complex  chemicals.  Plastics  shipments  support  automotive,  housing,  and  the  durable  and  disposable consumer  goods  markets.  Forest  product  shipments  include  lumber  and  paper  commodities.  Lumber  shipments originate primarily in the Pacific Northwest or western Canada and move throughout the U.S. for use in new home construction and repairs and remodeling. Paper shipments primarily support packaging needs. Oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel, finished pipe, stone, and drilling fluid commodities. The Company's petroleum and LPG  shipments  are  primarily  impacted  by  refinery  utilization  rates,  regional  crude  pricing  differentials,  pipeline capacity, and the use of asphalt for road programs. Soda ash originates in southwestern Wyoming and California, destined for chemical and glass producing markets in North America and abroad.\n\nPremium - In 2021, Premium shipments generated 31% of Union Pacific's total freight revenues. Premium includes finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. International business consists of import and export traffic moving in 20 or 40-foot shipping containers, that mainly pass through West Coast ports, destined for one of the Company's many inland intermodal terminals. Domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within North America for intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and logistics companies) as well as truckload carriers.\n\nWe are the largest automotive carrier west of the Mississippi River and operate or access 38 vehicle distribution centers. The Railroad's extensive franchise serves five vehicle assembly plants and connects to West Coast ports, all  six  major  Mexico  gateways,  and  the  Port  of  Houston  to  accommodate  both  import  and  export  shipments.  In addition  to  transporting  finished  vehicles,  the  Company  provides  expedited  handling  of  automotive  parts  in  both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for Mexico, the U.S., and Canada.\n\nSeasonality - Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity (such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons) and the demand cycle for the commodity (such as intermodal traffic that generally peaks during the third quarter to meet back-to-school and holiday-related demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter). The peak shipping seasons  for  these  commodities  can  vary  considerably  each  year  depending  upon  various  factors,  including  the strength  of  domestic  and  international  economies  and  currencies;  consumer  demand;  the  strength  of  harvests, which can be adversely affected by severe weather; and market prices for agricultural products.",

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's historical execution of share repurchase programs between 2019 and 2021 align with its forward-looking financial expectations for 2022 and the cautionary language around forward-looking statements, particularly in light of the significant treasury stock reductions and associated costs shown in the equity statement?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific's equity statement on page 58 shows that between 2019 and 2021, the company executed significant share repurchase programs, reducing treasury shares by 33.3 million in 2021 alone and cumulatively spending $17.2 billion over the three years. This historical execution demonstrates a consistent commitment to returning capital to shareholders. On page 33, the company's 2022 Outlook states an expectation to 'continue our industry leading dividend payout ratio and strong share repurchase programs,' indicating a forward-looking continuation of this strategy. However, page 50's cautionary language emphasizes that such forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the lingering impacts of the pandemic and economic volatility, which could materially affect financial outcomes. Thus, while the company has a strong track record of executing buybacks and expects to continue doing so, the cautionary context underscores that future repurchase activity is contingent on a stable economic environment and sufficient cash flow generation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\n- Safety - Operating a safe railroad benefits all our constituents: our employees, customers, shareholders, and the communities we serve. We will continue using a multi-faceted approach to safety utilizing technology, risk assessments, training, employee engagement, quality control, and targeted capital investments. As mentioned previously, our initiatives will be informed by recommendations identified in the third-party assessment of the effectiveness of our safety program. Consistent with these recommendations, we will continually evaluate and adjust  deployment  of  Total  Safety  Culture,  Courage  to  Care,  COMMIT,  and  Peer  to  Peer  throughout  our operations, which allows us to identify and implement best practices for employee and operational safety. In addition,  our  Operating  Practices  Command  Center  will  continue  the  implementation  of  our  predictive technology and reduce variability by identifying causes of mainline service interruptions and develop solutions, in  addition  to,  assisting  employees  with  understanding  policies,  procedures,  and  best  practices  for  handling trains. We will continue our efforts to utilize data to identify and mitigate risk, detect rail defects, improve or close crossings, and educate the public and law enforcement agencies about crossing safety through a combination of our own programs (including risk assessment strategies), industry programs, and local community activities across  the  network.  We  also  are  dedicated  to  maintaining  a  healthy  workplace  and  continue  monitoring  the COVID case levels, modifying our policies as needed to protect employees and minimize the risk of workplace transmission.\n- Network Operations - In 2022, we will continue transforming our railroad to increase reliability of our service product, reduce variability in network operations, and improve resource utilization. Further train length initiatives allow us to efficiently add incremental volume growth to our existing train network. We will continue to make capital investments to improve operational performance and efficiency. A more efficient network requires fewer locomotives, freight cars, and other resources.\n- Financial  Expectations -  We  expect  volume  to  outpace  industrial  production  in  2022  as  the  results  of  our business development efforts are bringing new customers to our railroad. In the current environment, we expect continued margin improvement driven by pricing in excess of inflation and ongoing efficiency initiatives, better leveraging  our  resources  and  improving  our  service  product.  We  expect  to  generate  strong  cash  flow  from operating  activities  allowing  us  to  continue  our  industry  leading  dividend  payout  ratio  and  strong  share repurchase  programs.  Economic  uncertainties  remain  in  2022  as  COVID  impacts  linger  and  could  have  a material impact on our 2022 financial and operating results. Regardless of external factors, we will focus on efficiently managing operations; seeking new business opportunities; protecting our employees, customers, and communities; and providing excellent service to our customers.\n- Market Conditions - While current forecasts for industrial production indicate continued economic growth, we expect uncertainties with COVID and the economy to continue in 2022. How governments and consumers react to  the  resurgence,  mutation  of  the  virus,  and  vaccine  mandates  could  result  in  or  contribute  to  customer disruptions, an elongated recovery period, constrained workforce availability, or a general economic downturn from current levels. Disruptions in our customers' supply chains caused by the pandemic or other factors may continue  to  impact  our  shipments.  In  addition,  other  factors  such  as  changes  in  monetary  policy  may  affect economic activity and demand for rail transportation; natural gas prices, weather conditions, and demand for other  energy  sources  may  impact  the  coal  market;  crude  oil  price  spreads  may  drive  demand  for  petroleum products and drilling materials; available truck capacity could impact our intermodal business; and international trade agreements could promote or hinder trade.\n- Fuel Prices -  Projections  for  crude  oil  and  natural  gas  continue  to  fluctuate  in  the  current  environment.  We again could see volatile fuel prices during the year, as they are sensitive to global and U.S. domestic demand, refining capacity, geopolitical events, weather conditions, and other factors. As prices fluctuate, there will be a timing  impact  on  earnings,  as  our  fuel  surcharge  programs  trail  increases  or  decreases  in  fuel  price  by approximately two months.\n- Significant changes in fuel prices could have an impact on consumer discretionary spending, impacting demand for  various  consumer  products  we  transport.  Alternatively,  those  changes  could  have  an  inverse  impact  on commodities such as coal, petroleum products, and domestic drilling-related shipments.\n- Capital Plan - In 2022, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.3 billion, up 10% from 2021 as we make investments to support our growth strategy. We will continue to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and improve the safety and resilience of the network. In addition, the plan includes targeted freight car acquisitions,  investments  in  growth-related  projects  to  drive  more  carloads  to  the  network,  certain  ramps  to efficiently  handle  volumes  from  new  and  existing  intermodal  customers,  continuous  modernization  of  our locomotive  fleet,  and  projects  intended  to  improve  operational  efficiency.  The  capital  plan  may  be  revised  if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments.

      "question": "How does Union Pacific's exposure to fuel price volatility, as outlined in their risk factors, reconcile with the actual financial impact of rising diesel prices in 2021 and their competitive positioning in relation to alternative transportation modes?",
      "answer": "Union Pacific faces significant exposure to fuel price volatility, as noted in their risk factors, where a dramatic increase in diesel prices could materially affect operating results. In 2021, locomotive diesel fuel prices averaged $2.23 per gallon, up from $1.50 in 2020, contributing to a $668 million increase in fuel expenses. This aligns with the risk disclosure that rising fuel prices could significantly impact costs, especially given that surcharge programs lag price changes by about two months, creating volatility in quarterly results. Additionally, while rail transport is more fuel-efficient than trucking, improvements in alternative transportation modes\u2014such as more fuel-efficient trucks\u2014could reduce Union Pacific's competitive advantage and constrain pricing power, particularly if fuel costs remain elevated and trucking becomes more economically viable for certain freight segments.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations have been adversely affected, and in the future, could be materially adversely affected by pandemics or other public health crises -  Our  business,  financial  condition,  and results of operations have been adversely affected by COVID. COVID has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, resulting further in adverse  effects  on  workforces,  customers,  and  regional  and  local  economies.  Other  future  pandemics  or  public health crises may cause these same or similar consequences. Because the severity, magnitude, and duration of the COVID pandemic and its economic consequences are rapidly changing, and difficult to predict, the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of the COVID pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors, which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control. These factors also may be of importance for other  pandemics  or  public  health  crises,  including,  but  not  limited  to:  governmental,  business,  and  individuals' actions  that  have  been  and  continue  to  be  taken  in  response  to  a  global  pandemic  or  other  public  health crises  (including  restrictions  on  travel  and  transport,  workforce  pressures,  social  distancing,  and  shelter-in-place orders); the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and their demand for our services; the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on the credit-worthiness of our customers; national or global supply chain challenges or disruption; facility closures; commodity cost volatility; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides as well as response to a potential reoccurrence. Further, a pandemic or other public health crises, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from such an event, could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factors that  we  identify,  which  could  materially  adversely  affect  our  business,  financial  condition,  results  of  operations (including revenues and profitability), and/or stock price. Additionally, a pandemic or other public health crises also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nWe  Are  Affected  By  Fluctuating  Fuel  Prices -  Fuel  costs  constitute  a  significant  portion  of  our  transportation expenses. Diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our  fuel  expenses  from  our  customers  through  revenue  from  fuel  surcharges,  we  cannot  be  certain  that  we  will always  be  able  to  mitigate  rising  or  elevated  fuel  costs  through  our  fuel  surcharges.  Additionally,  future  market conditions  or  legislative  or  regulatory  activities  could  adversely  affect  our  ability  to  apply  fuel  surcharges  or adequately  recover  increased  fuel  costs  through  fuel  surcharges.  As  fuel  prices  fluctuate,  our  fuel  surcharge programs  trail  such  fluctuations  in  fuel  price  by  approximately  two  months,  and  may  be  a  significant  source  of quarter-over-quarter  and  year-over-year  volatility,  particularly  in  periods  of  rapidly  changing  prices.  International, political, and economic factors, events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. A severe shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  results  of  operations,  financial  condition,  and  liquidity. Alternatively, lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport. However, lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport, such as coal and domestic drilling-related shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\nWe Rely on Capital Markets - Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements. We utilize longterm debt instruments, bank financing, and commercial paper, and we pledge certain amount of our receivables as collateral  for  credit.  Significant  instability  or  disruptions  of  the  capital  markets,  including  the  credit  markets,  or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to, and significantly increase the cost of, commercial paper and other financing sources, including bank credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt, including corporate bonds. A significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade, which could restrict or, at certain credit levels below investment grade, may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility  (Receivables Facility). This may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.\n\n## General Risk Factors\n\nWe Are Affected  by  General  Economic  Conditions -  Prolonged,  severe  adverse  domestic  and  global  economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets, including inflation, may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\n\nWe May Be Affected by Acts of Terrorism, War, or Risk of War - Our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, including rail  cars  carrying  hazardous  materials,  could  be  direct  targets  or  indirect  casualties  of  terrorist  attacks.  Terrorist attacks, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nWe Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations - Due to the nature of the railroad business, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other  materials;  and  hazardous  material  or  petroleum  releases.  We  generate  and  transport  hazardous  and  nonhazardous waste in our operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, properties owned by third-parties, as well as properties we currently own. Environmental liabilities have  arisen  and  may  also  arise  from  claims  asserted  by  adjacent  landowners  or  other  third-parties  in  toxic  tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under,  these  laws  or  regulations.  We  currently  have  certain  obligations  at  existing  sites  for  investigation, remediation,  and  monitoring,  and  we  likely  will  have  obligations  at  other  sites  in  the  future.  Liabilities  for  these obligations  affect  our  estimate  based  on  our  experience  and,  as  necessary,  the  advice  and  assistance  of  our consultants.  However,  actual  costs  may  vary  from  our  estimates  due  to  any  or  all  of  several  factors,  including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws, technological changes affecting investigations and remediation,  the  participation  and  financial  viability  of  other  parties  responsible  for  any  such  liability,  and  the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites. We could incur significant  costs  as  a  result  of  any  of  the  foregoing,  and  we  may  be  required  to  incur  significant  expenses  to investigate  and  remediate  known,  unknown,  or  future  environmental  contamination,  which  could  have  a  material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n\n## Macroeconomic and Industry Risks\n\nWe Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers - We face competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. Our main railroad competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC. Its primary subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition exists for all three of our commodity groups (excluding most coal shipments). Because of the proximity of our routes to  major  inland  and  Gulf  Coast  waterways,  barges  can  be  particularly  competitive,  especially  for  grain  and  bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality, and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service. However, railroads are much more fuel-efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure, and we have been making efforts to convert truck traffic to rail. Additionally, we must build or acquire and  maintain  our  rail  system,  while  trucks,  barges,  and  maritime  operators  are  able  to  use  public  rights-of-way maintained  by  public  entities.  Any  of  the  following  could  also  affect  the  competitiveness  of  our  transportation services for some or all of our commodities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity: (i) improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks, (ii) legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (iii) legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. Many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products (e.g., natural gas instead of coal, sorghum instead of corn) or commodities from different locations (e.g., grain from states or countries that we do not serve, crude oil from different regions). Sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain  prices. Additionally,  any  future  consolidation  of  the  rail  industry  could  materially  affect  our  competitive environment.\n\nWe  May  Be  Affected  by  Climate  Change  and  Market  or  Regulatory  Responses  to  Climate  Change -  Climate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of GHGs, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that  (a)  use  commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering  the  commodities  we  carry,  or  (c)  manufacture  or  produce  goods  that  consume  significant  amounts  of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy, emissions reductions, and GHG emissions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry and demand for our services, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative  sources  of  energy  also  could  affect  certain  of  our  customers  and  the  markets  for  certain  of  the commodities  we  carry  in  an  unpredictable  manner  that  could  alter  our  traffic  patterns,  including,  for  example, increasing royalties charged to producers of PRB coal by the U.S. Department of Interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives  on  farming  and  ethanol  producers.  We  could  face  increased  costs  related  to  defending  and  resolving legal  claims  and  other  litigation  related  to  climate  change  and  the  alleged  impact  of  our  operations  on  climate change.  Violent  weather  caused  by  climate  change,  including  earthquakes,  hurricanes,  fires,  floods,  extreme temperatures,  avalanches,  and  significant  precipitation  could  cause  line  outages  and  other  interruptions  to  our infrastructure.  Any  of  these  factors,  individually  or  in  operation  with  one  or  more  of  the  other  factors,  or  other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. While we work to implement our Climate Action Plan, our efforts to achieve emission reduction targets could significantly increase our operational costs and capital expenditures.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOperating expenses increased $767 million in 2021 compared to  2020  driven  by  higher  fuel  prices,  volume-related  costs, inflation,  higher  casualty  costs,  2020  management  actions, weather and wildfire-related expenses, incentive compensation,  and  higher  state  and  local  taxes.  Partially offsetting  these  increases  compared  to  2020  include  a  $278 million  impairment  charge  in  2020,  productivity  initiatives,  a one-time  bonus  payment  for  agreement  employees  in  2020, and lower severance costs. Full year results of 2021 and 2020 both include a reduction of expense for weather and wildfirerelated insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n2021 Operating Expenses\n\nCompensation and Benefits -  Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension  costs,  and  incentive  costs.  In  2021,  expenses  increased  4%  compared  to  2020,  due  to  volume  related costs,  inflation,  2020  management  actions  responding  to  the  sharp  decline  in  volume  (temporary  unpaid  leave, salary reductions, and shop closures), incentive compensation, and higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3% compared to 2020 despite a 4% volume increase, a 2020 one-time bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic, and lower severance costs.\n\nDepreciation -  The  majority  of  depreciation  relates  to  road  property,  including  rail,  ties,  ballast,  and  other  track material. Depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020.\n\nFuel -  Fuel  includes  locomotive  fuel  and  gasoline  for  highway  and  non-highway  vehicles  and  heavy  equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.23 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2021, compared  to  $1.50  per  gallon  in  2020,  increased  expenses  $668  million  (excluding  any  impact  from  increased volume year-over-year). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\n\nPurchased Services and Materials - Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased  from  outside  contractors  and  other  service  providers  (including  equipment  maintenance  and  contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad's lines, structures, and  equipment;  costs  of  operating  facilities jointly  used  by  UPRR  and  other  railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile  maintenance  expenses;  and  tools  and  supplies.  Purchased  services  and  materials  increased  3%  in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation, higher professional services expense, volume-related costs associated with  our  intermodal  business,  higher  costs  due  to  weather  and  wildfire-related  events,  increased  locomotive  and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network, and higher costs for transportation of train crews.\n\nEquipment  and  Other  Rents -  Equipment  and  other  rents  expense  primarily  includes  rental  expense  that  the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases;  and  office  and  other  rent  expenses,  offset  by  equity  income  from  certain  equity  method  investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 2% compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and  higher  equity  income  from  our  investment  in  TTX  Company,  partially  offset  by  increased  freight  car  rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity.\n\nOther - Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal  injury,  environmental,  employee  travel,  telephone  and  cellular,  computer  software,  bad  debt,  and  other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a $278 million noncash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment in 2020, lower write-offs of cancelled in-progress capital  projects,  2020  lease  impairments,  and  higher  equity  income.  Partially  offsetting  these  decreases  were increased casualty expenses, including personal injury, damaged freight, and environmental, and higher state and local  taxes.  Both  periods  in  2021  and  2020  included  a  reduction  of  expense  for  weather  and  wildfire-related insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\n\n## Non-Operating Items\n\n",

      "answer": "3M's operating income margins decreased by 1.5 percentage points year-on-year in 2021, with raw material, logistics, and outsourced manufacturing costs significantly pressuring margins. These increases were driven by global supply chain disruptions and extreme weather events like winter storm Uri. However, the company partially offset these pressures through restructuring actions\u2014such as those taken in 2020 and 2021\u2014and productivity efforts, which included cost savings and lower related charges. Additionally, foreign exchange impacts contributed approximately $103 million in favor of operating income, reflecting the benefit of exchange rate movements and hedging strategies.

Factoring out the impact on operating income of special items as described in the Certain amounts adjusted for special items -(non-GAAP measures) section below, operating income margins decreased 0.5 percentage points to 20.8 percent for the year ending December 31, 2021 when compared to 2020. Various COVID-19 implications contributed in part to these results.\n\nOverall, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on 3M's consolidated results of operations was primarily driven by factors related to changes in demand for products and disruption in global supply chains. While it is not feasible to identify or quantify all the other direct and indirect implications on 3M's results of operations, below are factors that 3M believes have also affected its 2021 results when compared to 2020:\n\nFactors contributing to charges or other impacts:\n\n- Increased raw materials and logistics costs from ongoing COVID-19 related global supply chain challenges further magnified by extreme weather events, such as February 2021 winter storm Uri in the United States.\n- Cost management in discretionary spending in areas such as travel, professional services, and advertising/merchandising resulting in lower spending in 2020.\n- Government-sponsored COVID-response stimulus and relief initiatives in 2020, including certain employee retention benefits under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act in the United States.\n- Lower incentive compensation and self-insured medical visit/insurance expense in 2020.\n\n## Factors providing benefits or other impacts:\n\n- Continued productivity efforts, including year-on-year savings from restructuring actions taken in 2020 and 2021.\n- Period expenses of unabsorbed manufacturing costs and increased expected credit losses on customer receivables in 2020.\n- Restructuring actions addressing structural enterprise costs and operations in certain end markets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic impact resulting in a 2020 charge of $58 million.\n- Committed financial support in 2020 to various COVID-relief and medical research initiatives.\n- Charge of $22 million in 2020 related to equity securities as discussed in the 'Assets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis' section of Note 15 that use the measurement alternative described therein in addition to an immaterial pre-tax charge related to impairment of certain indefinite lived tradenames.\n\nRefer to the Financial Condition and Liquidity section below for more information on the Company's liquidity position.\n\nDue to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation is developing and evolving and the uncertainty of its duration and the timing of recovery, 3M is not able at this time to predict the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition.",

Partially offsetting these increased costs were year-on-year net gains related to certain property sales (in 2020 within Safety and Industrial and in 2019 within Corporate and Unallocated), lower non divestiture-related restructuring charges year-on-year, in addition to benefits recognized in 2020 related to the restructuring and other actions taken in 2019 (and the adjustments thereto in 2020) along with continued cost management and productivity efforts.\n- On a combined basis, higher defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost increased expense year-on-year for both 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Selling price and raw material impact:\n\n- In 2021, 3M experienced higher raw material, logistics, and outsourced manufacturing costs from strong end-market demand and ongoing COVID-19 and related global supply chain challenges that were further magnified by extreme weather events, such as February 2021 winter storm Uri in the U.S. These factors were partially offset by higher selling prices in 2021.\n- In 2020, higher selling prices in addition to lower raw material cost impacts benefited operating income margins year-onyear\n\n## Acquisitions/divestitures:\n\n- Divestiture impacts in 2021 and 2020 are primarily comprised of the lost income from the divestiture of the Company's drug delivery business (sale completed in May 2020).\n- Acquisition impacts, which are measured for the first twelve months post-transaction, relate to the acquisitions of M*Modal (first quarter 2019), and Acelity (fourth quarter 2019). The net impacts related to these acquisitions included income from operations, more than offset by transaction and integration costs. Financing costs related to these acquisitions is also included.\n\n## Foreign exchange impacts:\n\n- Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) increased operating income by approximately $103 million and decreased operating income by approximately $62 million (or an increase in pre-tax earnings of approximately $119 million and a decrease in pre-tax earnings of approximately $57 million) year-on-year for 2021 and 2020, respectively. These estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into U.S. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3M operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. Prior to 2021, for (a) 3M used prior year functional currency profits and nonfunctional currency purchase/transfer information as the base in determining these amounts. Comparative prior period amounts have been updated to reflect this updated methodology.\n\n## Other expense (income), net:\n\n- Higher income related to non-service cost components of pension and postretirement expense decreased expense year-onyear for both 2021 and 2020.\n- Interest expense (net of interest income) decreased in 2021 compared to the same periods year-on-year. 2021 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment pre-tax charge in the first quarter of 2021.\n- Interest expense (net of interest income) increased in 2020, as a result of higher U.S. average debt balances and lower year-on-year interest income driven by lower average interest rates on cash balances. 2020 interest expense also included an early debt extinguishment charge in conjunction with the repayment of notes in December 2020.\n\n## Income tax rate :\n\n- Certain items above reflect specific income tax rates associated therewith. Overall, the effective tax rates for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 17.8 percent, 19.7 percent, and 19.7 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 1.9 percentage points from 2020 to 2021 and a flat comparison from 2019 to 2020.\n- On an adjusted basis (as discussed below), the effective tax rates for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were 17.8 percent, 20.3 percent, and 20.2 percent, respectively. These reflect a decrease of 2.5 percentage points from 2020 to 2021 and an increase of 0.1 percentage points from 2019 to 2020.\n- The primary factors that decreased the Company's effective tax rate in 2021 were geographical income mix and favorable adjustments in 2021 related to impacts of U.S. international tax provisions. Refer to Note 10 for additional details.\n\n## Shares of common stock outstanding:\n\n- Higher shares outstanding decreased earnings per share per diluted share for 2021, while lower shares outstanding increased earnings per share diluted share for 2020.",

Special items include significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, certain litigation and environmental expenses largely related to legacy products businesses not allocated to business segments, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former Drug Delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n## Elimination of Dual Credit\n\n3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management evaluates each of its four business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth. As a result, 3M reflects additional ('dual') credit to another business segment when the customer account activity ('sales district') with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division level. For example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the Display Materials and Systems Division within the Transportation and Electronics business segment; however, certain sales districts within the Consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Consumer) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled 'Elimination of Dual Credit,' such that sales and operating income in total are unchanged.\n\n## Geographic Information\n\nGeographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. Refer to Note 2 for geographic net sales.\n\n",

The change to business segment operating income aligns with the update to how the CODM assesses performance and allocates resources for the Company's business segments (see Note 19 for additional details).\n\nInformation provided herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3M manages its operations in four business segments.

On page 140, the gain/loss on sale of businesses is categorized as a 'special item' within Corporate and Unallocated, which also includes litigation charges and restructuring actions, suggesting that such gains or losses are not part of core segment operations. Furthermore, as noted on page 137, these gains or losses are excluded from business segment operating income and are instead included in Corporate and Unallocated, reinforcing that they are treated as non-operational and non-recurring in nature. Therefore, the absence of a gain/loss in 2021 suggests either a lack of significant divestitures or a strategic decision to retain businesses, which affects the interpretation of 3M's corporate restructuring and capital allocation strategy over time.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Corporate and Unallocated\n\nCorporate and Unallocated operating income includes 'special items' and 'other corporate expense-net'. Special items include significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses, and divestiture-related restructuring costs. Other corporate expense-net includes items such as net costs related to limited unallocated corporate staff and centrally managed material resource centers of expertise costs, certain litigation and environmental expenses largely related to legacy products businesses not allocated to business segments, corporate philanthropic activity, and other net costs that 3M may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. Other corporate expense-net also includes costs and income from contract manufacturing, transition services and other arrangements with the acquirer of the Communication Markets Division following its 2018 divestiture through 2019 and the acquirer of the former Drug Delivery business following its 2020 divestiture. Items classified as revenue from this activity are included in Corporate and Unallocated net sales. Because Corporate and Unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.\n\n## Elimination of Dual Credit\n\n3M business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain sales and related operating income. Management evaluates each of its four business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit reporting to further incentivize sales growth. As a result, 3M reflects additional ('dual') credit to another business segment when the customer account activity ('sales district') with respect to the particular product sold to the external customer is provided by a different business segment. This additional dual credit is largely reflected at the division level. For example, privacy screen protection products are primarily sold by the Display Materials and Systems Division within the Transportation and Electronics business segment; however, certain sales districts within the Consumer business segment provide the customer account activity for sales of the product to particular customers. In this example, the non-primary selling segment (Consumer) would also receive credit for the associated net sales initiated through its sales district and the related approximate operating income. The assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. The offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled 'Elimination of Dual Credit,' such that sales and operating income in total are unchanged.\n\n## Geographic Information\n\nGeographic area information is used by the Company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. Export sales and certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3M customers are made. Refer to Note 2 for geographic net sales.\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $15 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to performance shares. This expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average earnings period of 20 months. The total fair value of performance shares that were distributed were $22 million, $35 million, and $45 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company's actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the distribution of performance shares were $4 million, $7 million, and $9 million per year for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\n## General Employees' Stock Purchase Plan (GESPP):\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, shareholders have approved 60 million shares for issuance under the Company's GESPP. Substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. Participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. There are no GESPP shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.\n\nThe weighted-average fair value per option granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $27.80, $23.47 and $27.14, respectively. The fair value of GESPP options was based on the 15% purchase price discount. The Company recognized compensation expense for GESSP options of $32 million in 2021, $31 million in 2020, and $30 million in 2019.\n\n## NOTE 19. Business Segments and Geographic Information\n\n3M's businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in markets, products, technologies and services. 3M manages its operations in four business segments: Safety and Industrial; Transportation and Electronics; Health Care; and Consumer. 3M's four business segments bring together common or related 3M technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. Transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3M is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. Therefore, management does not represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income information shown.\n\n3M discloses business segment operating income as its measure of segment profit/loss, reconciled to both total 3M operating income and income before taxes. Business segment operating income includes dual credit for certain related operating income (as described below in 'Elimination of Dual Credit'). Business segment operating income excludes certain expenses and income that are not allocated to business segments (as described below in 'Corporate and Unallocated'). Additionally, the following special items are excluded from business segment operating income and, instead, are included within Corporate and Unallocated: significant litigation-related charges/benefits, gain/loss on sale of businesses (see Note 3), and divestiture-related restructuring actions (see Note 5).",

      "question": "How does the treatment of 'Other Expense (Income), Net' across MMM's consolidated income statement, hedging disclosures, and historical financial adjustments reflect its evolving impact on pre-tax income and financial performance consistency over the 2019\u20132021 period?",
      "answer": "The consolidated income statement on page 139 shows that 'Other Expense (Income), Net' declined from $531 million in 2019 to $165 million in 2021, directly contributing to an increase in income before income taxes from $5.6 billion to $7.2 billion over the same period. Page 107 reveals that this line item includes significant derivative-related gains and losses, such as a $43 million loss in 2020 and a $13 million loss in 2019 from foreign currency contracts not designated as hedging instruments, indicating volatility stemming from currency and interest rate exposures. Page 66 further shows that prior-year amounts were retrospectively adjusted, with the 2019 figure increasing from $462 million to $531 million and the 2020 figure decreasing from $450 million to $366 million, suggesting methodological or accounting changes that affect trend analysis. Together, these perspectives show that 'Other Expense (Income), Net' is a dynamic component of MMM\u2019s financials, influenced by both market-driven hedging outcomes and accounting adjustments, impacting the consistency of pre-tax income reporting.",

      "question": "How does Emerson's treatment of 'Other Deductions, Net' in segment-level financial performance (Climate Technologies and ISE/TOD) align with its consolidated disclosures about restructuring, acquisition/divestiture costs, and foreign currency impacts?",
      "answer": "Emerson's 'Other Deductions, Net' in the Climate Technologies and ISE/TOD segments show increasing costs over time, with $252 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2024 for Climate Technologies, and $12 million in 2023 for ISE/TOD. These segment-level costs align with the consolidated disclosures on page 26, which state that 'Other deductions, net' increased by $928 million in 2024 compared to 2023, driven by intangibles amortization from the Test & Measurement acquisition ($560 million), higher restructuring costs ($156 million), and divestiture losses ($48 million). Additionally, page 59 shows a significant foreign currency impact of $(128) million in 2023 under 'Other deductions, net,' which explains part of the volatility in the segment-level figures. This synthesis reveals that foreign exchange movements and strategic M&A activities are key drivers behind the changes in 'Other Deductions, Net' across both consolidated and segment reporting.",

        "Hop 1: [EMR](page_59) \u2192 [Other Deductions, Net]: Foreign currency impacts of $(128) million in 2023 are disclosed, indicating volatility in this line item due to exchange rate movements.",

        "Hop 3: [EMR](page_54) \u2192 [Other Deductions, Net]: Segment-level data shows $252 million in 2023 and $104 million in 2024 for Climate Technologies, and $12 million in 2023 for ISE/TOD, reflecting rising costs aligned with corporate-level M&A and restructuring activity."

      "question": "What explains the divergence in growth trends for Emerson's China sales between 2023 and 2024, and how does this contrast with the overall performance of the Asia, Middle East & Africa region during those periods?",
      "answer": "In 2023, China sales increased by 4%, contributing positively to the 9% underlying sales growth in the Asia, Middle East & Africa region. However, in 2024, China sales declined by 2%, even as the broader region still achieved 8% underlying growth. This divergence suggests that while other markets in the region accelerated, China experienced a slowdown, potentially due to local economic conditions or sector-specific demand shifts. Additionally, the overall international sales grew 18% in 2024, reaching $10.5 billion, partly driven by the Test & Measurement acquisition, but the drop in China sales indicates a more nuanced performance within the region.",

In 2023 compared to 2022, AMEA sales in Intelligent Devices grew by 8%, with China up 2%. However, in the broader context, Measurement & Analytical sales in 2023 saw moderate AMEA growth due to softness in China, while 2024 showed robust growth across all geographies.

      "answer": "The significant growth in the Software and Control segment\u2019s revenue, paired with increased capital expenditures and a sharp rise in depreciation and amortization, suggests that Emerson is making substantial strategic investments to scale this business area. The 19.7% revenue increase indicates strong market demand or successful execution of growth initiatives. The 25.8% increase in capital expenditures points to new investments in infrastructure, technology, or capabilities, while the 73.7% jump in depreciation and amortization implies that these investments are being actively deployed and are now contributing to operations. This aligns with a strategy of aggressive growth and long-term positioning in software-driven industrial solutions.",

      "answer": "Emerson's 40% increase in net earnings attributable to common stockholders was driven by consistent quarterly growth across 2022, particularly a jump from $627 million in Q3 2021 to $921 million in Q3 2022 and strong full-year performance. This $928 million increase directly contributed to the growth in retained earnings, which rose from $26.05 billion at the beginning of 2022 to $28.05 billion by year-end. The earnings growth also supported the company's 31.9% return on common stockholders' equity in 2022, up from 25.2% in 2021, reflecting improved profitability relative to equity capital.",

      "answer": "The 'Gain on Subordinated Interest' had a $453 million negative impact on Emerson's 2022 cash flow from operating activities, as shown in the cash flow statement. This same item reduced earnings per share by $0.60 in the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted diluted earnings per share. Additionally, it was listed as a separate line item reducing earnings before income taxes in the income statement analysis, indicating a direct and consistent recognition of this item across financial reporting sections. This alignment shows that the gain was a material one-time item affecting both profitability metrics and cash flow.",

      "question": "How does Emerson's strategic framing of underlying sales growth in the context of share repurchase activity relate to the geographic performance breakdown and the impact of pricing versus volume in the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment?",
      "answer": "Emerson's underlying sales growth is framed as a key metric for evaluating operational performance, especially in the context of strategic share repurchase activity. In fiscal 2022, the company completed its 2015 share repurchase authorization and still had approximately 55 million shares available under the 2020 authorization, indicating confidence in financial strength amid growth. During the same year, underlying sales increased 9% overall, with 4% from volume and 5% from price, and the U.S. contributing 14% growth. In the Commercial & Residential Solutions segment specifically, underlying sales rose 13% in 2022, driven by 10% from pricing and only 3% from volume, with the Americas (led by the U.S. at 14%) contributing the strongest regional growth. This suggests that Emerson leveraged pricing power significantly in this segment, particularly in the U.S., to drive underlying sales growth despite moderate volume expansion, supporting strategic capital deployment decisions like share repurchases.",

These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Emerson undertakes no obligation to update any such statements to reflect later developments. In connection with the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Emerson provides the cautionary statements set forth under Item 1A - 'Risk Factors,' which are hereby incorporated by reference and identify important economic, political and technological factors, among others, changes in which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions.\n\n## Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement the Company's financial information presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), management periodically uses certain 'non-GAAP financial measures,' as such term is defined in Regulation G under SEC rules, to clarify and enhance understanding of past performance and prospects for the future. Generally, a non-GAAP financial measure is a numerical measure of a company's operating performance, financial position or cash flows that excludes or includes amounts that are included in or excluded from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. For example, non-GAAP measures may exclude the impact of certain items such as acquisitions or divestitures, amortization of intangibles, restructuring costs, discrete taxes, changes in reporting segments, gains, losses and impairments, or items outside of management's control, such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that the following non-GAAP financial measures provide investors and analysts useful insight into the Company's financial position and operating performance. Any non-GAAP measure provided should be viewed in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the most directly comparable measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as identified in italics below. Further, the calculation of these non-GAAP financial measures may differ from the calculation of similarly titled financial measures presented by other companies and therefore may not be comparable among companies.\n\nUnderlying sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates during the periods presented, are provided to facilitate relevant period-to-period comparisons of sales growth by excluding those items that impact overall comparability (U.S. GAAP measure: net sales ).\n\nOperating profit (defined as net sales less cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses) and operating profit margin (defined as operating profit divided by net sales) are indicative of short-term operational performance and ongoing profitability. Management closely monitors operating profit and operating profit margin of each business to evaluate past performance and actions required to improve profitability. EBIT (defined as earnings",

Foreign currency translation had a 2 percent unfavorable impact and divestitures deducted 2 percent. Underlying sales increased 13 percent on 3 percent higher volume and 10 percent higher price. Climate Technologies sales were $5.2 billion in 2022, an increase of $452, or 10 percent. Air conditioning, heating and refrigeration sales were strong, reflecting global demand across all end markets. Tools &amp; Home Products sales were $2.0 billion in 2022, up $128 or 7 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of professional tools and food waste disposers were strong, while wet/dry vacuums decreased moderately due to difficult comparisons. Overall, underlying sales increased 15 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 14 percent) and 11 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa increased 5 percent (China down 7 percent). Earnings were $1,440, an increase of $76, and margin was down 0.6 percentage points, as price less net material inflation was favorable but had a slightly dilutive impact on margins and higher freight and other inflation also negatively impacted margins, partially offset by leverage on higher sales and savings from cost reduction actions.\n\n2021 vs. 2020 - Commercial &amp; Residential Solutions sales were $6.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1,010, or 18 percent. Underlying sales increased 16 percent on strong global demand, as nearly all businesses achieved doubledigit growth each quarter, while foreign currency translation added 2 percent. Climate Technologies sales were $4.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $768, or 19 percent. Air conditioning and heating sales were up mid-teens, reflecting strong demand for residential-oriented products and solutions in North America and robust growth in Europe and China. Cold chain sales were up over 20 percent, driven by favorable global market conditions and strength in food retail and aftermarket. Tools &amp; Home Products sales were $1.9 billion in 2021, up $242 or 15 percent compared to the prior year. Sales of wet/dry vacuums were robust in part due to competitor outages, while sales were strong for global professional tools and solid for food waste disposers. Overall, underlying sales increased 16 percent in the Americas (U.S. up 15 percent) and 17 percent in Europe, while Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa increased 17 percent (China up 17 percent). Earnings were $1,364, an increase of $246, and margin was up 0.7 percentage points, reflecting leverage on higher volume and savings from cost reduction actions, partially offset by unfavorable price-cost primarily due to steel price increases which negatively impacted the second half of the fiscal year.\n\n## Financial Position, Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nEmerson maintains a conservative financial structure to provide the strength and flexibility necessary to achieve our strategic objectives and has been successful in efficiently deploying cash where needed worldwide to fund operations, complete acquisitions and sustain long-term growth.\n\nEmerson is in a strong financial position, with total assets of $36 billion and stockholders' equity of $10 billion, and has the resources available for reinvestment in existing businesses, strategic acquisitions and managing its capital structure on a short- and long-term basis.\n\nThe Company continues to generate substantial operating cash flow with over $2.9 billion in each of the last three years. Cash flows have been and are expected to be sufficient for at least the next 12 months to meet the Company's operating requirements, including those related to salaries and wages, working capital, capital expenditures, and other liquidity requirements associated with operations. The Company also has certain contractual obligations, primarily longterm debt and operating leases (see Notes 7, 10 and 11). The Company has been able to readily meet all its funding requirements and currently believes that sufficient funds will be available to meet its needs for the foreseeable future through operating cash flow, existing resources, short- and long-term debt capacity, or its $3.5 billion revolving backup credit facility under which it has not incurred any borrowings.",

      "question": "What does the increase in IT services revenue to $8,761 million in 2024, combined with the $302 million increase in operating income from IT services and the volume-driven growth in new programs, suggest about the profitability and growth trajectory of GD's IT services business?",
      "answer": "The increase in IT services revenue to $8,761 million in 2024 (from $8,459 million in 2023) indicates steady top-line growth. This aligns with the $302 million increase in operating income from IT services, suggesting strong margin expansion or cost control. Additionally, the mention of volume-driven growth, including the ramp-up of new programs, implies that the growth is not only sustainable but also expanding through new business wins. Together, these figures suggest that GD's IT services segment is both growing in scale and improving in profitability, with momentum from new program adoption contributing to both revenue and margin performance.",

As of December 31, 2024, the net amount of these advances was $67 million, down from $271 million in 2023.

In 2024, customer advances and deposits contributed $343 million to GD\u2019s operating cash flows, a significant drop from $2,415 million in 2023, indicating a reduction in new advance payments or increased liquidation of existing liabilities.

The Technologies segment disclosed a total estimated potential contract value of $48.1 billion, with 75% of its 2024 orders coming from IDIQ contracts or option exercises, underscoring a similar dependency on future funding decisions. Meanwhile, Gulfstream\u2019s international aircraft backlog, though not quantified directly, is part of the broader defense segments\u2019 $70.9 billion total backlog, where the unfunded portion and estimated potential contract value of $52.2 billion reflect exposure to uncertain future appropriations.

This operational risk raises concerns about the timing and feasibility of the planned spin-off of the Aviation business, which is part of GE's broader strategy to separate into three independent companies (page_60). Furthermore, the separation is intended to be tax-free for U.S. shareholders, but there is no assurance it will qualify as such; if it is determined to be taxable, GE could incur significant tax liabilities, which would complicate the financial viability of the spin-off and impact the newly formed Aviation company\u2019s financial position (page_62).

          "chunk_text": "on a different timeline than expected. If we are unable to complete any of the separations, we will have incurred costs without realizing the benefits of such transaction. In addition, the terms and conditions of the required regulatory authorizations and consents that are granted, if any, may impose requirements, limitations or costs, or place restrictions on the conduct of the independent companies. And, although we intend for the separation transactions to be tax-free to the Company's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we expect to incur non-U.S. cash taxes on the preparatory restructuring and may also incur non-cash tax expense including potential impairments of deferred tax assets. Moreover, there can be no assurance that the separation transactions will qualify as taxfree for U.S. purposes. If the separation transactions were ultimately determined to be taxable, we would incur a significant tax liability, while the distributions to the Company's shareholders would become taxable and the new independent companies might incur income tax liabilities as well. Furthermore, if the separation transactions are completed, we cannot be assured that each separate company will be successful.\n\nWhether or not the separation transactions are completed, our businesses may face material challenges in connection with these transactions, including, without limitation the diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns and impact on the businesses of the Company; appropriately allocating assets and liabilities among the three companies, particularly given the staggered nature of the separation transactions; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing or attracting new business and operational relationships, including with customers, suppliers, employees and other counterparties; assigning customer contracts and intellectual property to each of the businesses; and potential negative reactions from the financial markets. In particular, GE for the past several years has been undertaking various restructuring and business transformation actions (including workforce reductions, global facility consolidations and other cost reduction initiatives) that have entailed changes across our organizational structure, senior leadership, culture, functional alignment, outsourcing and other areas. This poses risks in the form of personnel capacity constraints and institutional knowledge loss that could lead to missed performance or financial targets, loss of key personnel and harm to our reputation, and these risks are heightened with the additional interdependent actions that will be needed to complete the planned separation transactions. Moreover, completion of the separation transactions will result in the three independent public companies that are smaller, less diversified companies with more limited businesses concentrated in their respective industries than GE is today. As a result, each company may be more vulnerable to changing market conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the diversification of revenues, costs, and cash flows will diminish, such that each company's results of operations, cash flows, working capital, effective tax rate, and financing requirements may be subject to increased volatility and its ability to fund capital expenditures and investments, pay dividends and meet debt obligations and other liabilities may be diminished. Each of the separate companies will also incur ongoing costs, including costs of operating as independent companies, that the separated businesses will no longer be able to share. Additionally, we cannot predict whether the market value of our common stock and the common stock of each of the new independent companies after the separation transactions will be, in the aggregate, less than, equal to or greater than the market value of our common stock prior to the separation transactions. If the separation transactions are completed, investors holding our common stock may sell the common stock of any of the new independent companies that do not match their investment strategies, which may cause a decline in the market price of such common stock.\n\nCOVID-19 - The global COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have a material adverse impact on our operations and financial performance, as well as on the operations and financial performance of many of the customers and suppliers in industries that we serve. Our operations and financial performance since early 2020 have been negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has caused, and may continue to cause, a slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), disruptions in global supply chains and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect economic activity globally or in various regions, the extent to which this will adversely impact our future operations and financial performance is uncertain. Across all of our businesses, we have experienced and expect to continue to experience operational challenges from the need to protect employee health and safety, site shutdowns, workplace disruptions and restrictions on the movement of people, raw materials and goods, both at our own facilities and at those of our customers and suppliers, global supply chain disruptions and price inflation. We also have experienced, and may continue experiencing, lower demand and volume for products and services, customer requests for potential payment deferrals or other contract modifications, supply chain under-liquidation, delays of deliveries and the achievement of other billing milestones, delays or cancellations of new projects and related down payments and other factors related directly and indirectly to the COVID-19 pandemic's effects on our customers that adversely impact our businesses. In particular, interruptions of regional and international air travel from COVID-19 are having a material adverse effect on our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our services and products. While our Aviation business is showing continued signs of recovery, the recently renewed intensity of the COVID-19 pandemic in many parts of the world could stall the recovery achieved to date and lead to future requests for payment deferrals, contract modifications, and similar actions across the aviation sector, which may lead to additional charges, impairments and other adverse financial impacts, or to customer disputes.\n\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control, including, but not limited, to: the severity and duration of the pandemic, including the impact of coronavirus variants and resurgences; governmental, business and individuals' actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transport and workforce pressures); the impact of the pandemic and actions taken in response on global and regional economies, travel, and economic activity; the development, availability and public acceptance of effective treatments or vaccines; our employees' compliance with vaccine mandates that may apply in various jurisdictions; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace and extent of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. A number of accounting estimates that we make have been and will continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and uncertainties related to these and other factors, and our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time in response to COVID-19 (see Note 1). As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risk factors described below.",

FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE GRAPH\n\nThe annual changes for the five-year period shown in the above graph are based on the assumption that $100 had been invested in General Electric common stock, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index (S&amp;P 500) and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Industrials Stock Index (S&amp;P Industrial) on December 31, 2016, and that all quarterly dividends were reinvested. The cumulative dollar returns shown on the graph represent the value that such investments would have had on December 31 for each year indicated. In 2020, we began measuring GE's relative performance against the S&amp;P Industrial index for performance share unit awards.\n\nWith respect to 'Market Information,' in the United States, General Electric common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol \"GE\" (its principal market). General Electric common stock is also listed on the London Stock Exchange, Euronext Paris, the SIX Swiss Exchange and the Frankfurt Stock Exchange.\n\nAs of January 31, 2022, there were approximately 294,000 shareholder accounts of record.\n\nPURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES BY THE ISSUER AND AFFILIATED PURCHASERS. GE repurchased 109,000 shares of common stock at an average price of $95.94, in connection with the settlement of hedging instruments related to the Company's deferred incentive compensation program during the three months ended December 31, 2021.\n\nRISK FACTORS. The following discussion of the material factors, events and uncertainties that may make an investment in the Company speculative or risky contains \"forward-looking statements,\" as discussed in the Forward-Looking Statements section. These risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Form 10-K report or elsewhere. The risks described below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks that we face, and additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also negatively impact us. The following information should be read in conjunction with the MD&amp;A section and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. The risks we describe in this Form 10-K report or in our other SEC filings could, in ways we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial position, results of operations, cash flows and stock price, and they could cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate.\n\nSTRATEGIC RISKS. Strategic risk relates to the Company's future business plans and strategies, including the risks associated with: our strategic plan to separate into three public companies; the global macro-environment; the global energy transition; competitive threats, the demand for our products and services and the success of our investments in technology and innovation; our portfolio of businesses and capital allocation decisions; dispositions, acquisitions, joint ventures and restructuring activity; intellectual property; and other risks.\n\nStrategic plan - We may encounter challenges to executing our plan to separate GE into three public companies, or to completing the plan within the timeframes we anticipate, and we may not realize some or all of the expected benefits of the separations. In November 2021, we announced our plan to form three independent public companies from our (i) Aviation business, (ii) Healthcare business and (iii) combined Renewable Energy, Power and Digital businesses, in order to better position those businesses to deliver long-term growth and create value for customers, investors, and employees. The planned business separations are expected to be effected through spin-offs by GE that are intended to be tax-free for the Company's shareholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. These separation transactions will be subject to the satisfaction of a number of customary conditions, including, among others, final approvals by GE's Board of Directors, receipt of tax rulings in certain jurisdictions and/or tax opinions from external counsel, the filing with the SEC and effectiveness of Form 10 registration statements, and satisfactory completion of financing. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the separation transactions for a significant period of time or prevent them from occurring at all. Additionally, the separation transactions are complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes may affect our ability to complete one or both of the separation transactions as currently expected, within the anticipated timeframes or at all. These or other developments could cause us not to realize some or all of the expected benefits, or to realize them",

      "question": "How does GE's accounting treatment of annuity benefits in its run-off insurance operations reconcile with the investment portfolio strategy supporting these liabilities and the risk factors associated with structured settlement annuities, particularly considering the impact of unrealized gains and expected capital contributions?",
      "answer": "GE accounts for annuity benefits under long-duration insurance contracts by calculating future policy benefit reserves as the present value of future benefits less the present value of future premiums. As of December 31, 2021, insurance liabilities and annuity benefits totaled $37.2 billion, including $10.3 billion in structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves. These liabilities are supported by an investment portfolio of $41.6 billion in investment securities and $1.8 billion in commercial mortgage loans, with $6.7 billion in net unrealized gains recorded in AOCI. GE is required to consider the impact of unrealized gains on investment securities as if realized, leading to a $3.4 billion increase in future policy benefit reserves in 2021 due to potential premium deficiencies. This reserve adjustment reflects both the lower unrealized gains compared to 2020 and the results of the 2021 premium deficiency test. Looking forward, GE plans to invest approximately $5.5 billion in new assets through 2024, including non-traditional asset classes such as private equity and infrastructure debt, to enhance yield and diversify risk while managing asset-liability duration variances and regulatory capital constraints.",

          "chunk_text": "We estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimates of expected credit losses.\n\nINVENTORIES. All inventories are stated at lower of cost or realizable values. Cost of inventories is primarily determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. See Note 5 for further information.\n\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. The cost of property, plant and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic life. See Note 6 for further information.\n\nLEASE ACCOUNTING FOR LESSEE ARRANGEMENTS. At lease commencement, we record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) asset. Options to extend the lease are included as part of the ROU lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. We have elected to include lease and non-lease components in determining our lease liability for all leased assets except our vehicle leases. Non-lease components are generally services that the lessor performs for the Company associated with the leased asset. The present value of our lease liability is determined using our incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease inception. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, an ROU asset and lease liability is not recognized and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We test ROU assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired.\n\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. When a portion of a reporting unit is disposed, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.\n\nFor other intangible assets that are not deemed indefinite-lived, cost is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated economic life, except for individually significant customer-related intangible assets that are amortized in relation to total related sales. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In these circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to estimated fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. See Note 7 for further information.\n\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. We use derivatives to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to interest rates, foreign exchange, certain equity investments and commodity prices. Accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that, at inception and over the term of the arrangement, the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting. In evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset, within a specified range, changes in the fair value of the hedged item. If fair value changes fail this test, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. Fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating marketbased assumptions, subject to third-party confirmation, as applicable. See Note 20 for further information.\n\nDEFERRED INCOME TAXES. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when those taxes are paid or recovered. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent we consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred taxes, as needed, are provided for our investment in affiliates and associated companies when we plan to remit those earnings. See Note 14 for further information.\n\nINSURANCE LIABILITIES AND ANNUITY BENEFITS. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks.\n\nLiabilities for traditional long-duration insurance contracts include both future policy benefit reserves and claims reserves. Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions. Liabilities for investment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date.\n\nClaim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred and represent our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustments expenses.\n\nTo the extent that unrealized gains on specific investment securities supporting our insurance contracts would result in a premium deficiency, should those gains be realized, an increase in future policy benefit reserves is recorded, with an offsetting after-tax reduction to net unrealized gains recorded in other comprehensive income.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(a)    Statutory balances reflect recognition of the estimated remaining statutory increase in reserves of approximately $3.6 billion through 2023 under the permitted accounting practice discussed further below and in Note 11 .\n\nStructured settlement annuities and life insurance contracts. We reinsure approximately 27,400 structured settlement annuities with an average attained age of 54. These structured settlement annuities were primarily underwritten on impaired lives (i.e., shorter-thanaverage life expectancies) at origination and have projected payments extending decades into the future. Our primary risks associated with these contracts include mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity), mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time), which may extend the duration of payments on life contingent contracts beyond our estimates, and reinvestment risk (i.e., a low interest rate environment may reduce our ability to achieve our targeted investment margins). Unlike long- term care insurance, structured settlement annuities offer no ability to require additional premiums or reduce benefits.\n\nOur life reinsurance business typically covers the mortality risk associated with various types of life insurance policies that we reinsure from approximately 150 ceding company relationships where we pay a benefit based on the death of a covered life. As of December 31, 2021, across our U.S. and Canadian life insurance blocks, we reinsure approximately $70 billion of net amount at risk (i.e., difference between the death benefit and any accrued cash value) from approximately 1.7 million policies with an average attained age of 60. In 2021, our incurred claims were approximately $0.6 billion with an average individual claim of approximately $50,000. The covered products primarily include permanent life insurance and 20 and 30-year level term insurance. We anticipate a significant portion of the 20-year level term policies, which represent approximately 25% of the net amount of risk, to lapse through 2024 as the policies reach the end of their 20-year level premium period.\n\nInvestment portfolio and other adjustments. Our insurance liabilities and annuity benefits are primarily supported by investment securities of $41.6 billion and $42.0 billion and commercial mortgage loans of $1.8 billion and $1.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Additionally, we expect to purchase approximately $5.5 billion of new assets through 2024 in conjunction with expected capital contributions to our insurance subsidiaries, of which approximately $2.0 billion is expected to be contributed in the first quarter of 2022, pending completion of our December 31, 2021 statutory reporting process, which includes asset adequacy testing. Our investment securities are classified as available-for-sale and comprise mainly investment-grade debt securities. The portfolio includes $6.7 billion of net unrealized gains that are recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), net of applicable taxes and other adjustments as of December 31, 2021.\n\nIn calculating our future policy benefit reserves, we are required to consider the impact of net unrealized gains and losses on our available-for-sale investment securities supporting our insurance contracts as if those unrealized amounts were realized. To the extent that the realization of gains would result in a premium deficiency, an adjustment is recorded to increase future policy benefit reserves with an after-tax offset to Accumulated other comprehensive income. At December 31, 2021, $3.4 billion of net unrealized gains on our investment securities required a related increase to future policy benefit reserves. This adjustment decreased from $8.2 billion in 2020 to $3.4 billion in 2021 primarily from the higher margin resulting from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities. See Note 3 for further information about our investment securities.\n\nWe manage the investments in our run-off insurance operations under strict investment guidelines, including limitations on asset class concentration, single issuer exposures, asset-liability duration variances, and other factors to meet credit quality, yield, liquidity and diversification requirements associated with servicing our insurance liabilities under reasonable circumstances. This process includes consideration of various asset allocation strategies and incorporates information from several external investment advisors to improve our investment yield subject to maintaining our ability to satisfy insurance liabilities when due, as well as considering our risk-based capital requirements, regulatory constraints, and tolerance for surplus volatility. With the expected capital contributions through 2024, we intend to further diversify our portfolio, including with non-traditional asset classes such as private equity, senior secured loans and infrastructure debt, among others. Asset allocation planning is a dynamic process that considers changes in market conditions, risk appetite, liquidity needs and other factors which are reviewed on a periodic basis by our investment team. Investing in these assets exposes us to both credit risk (i.e., debtor's ability to make timely payments of principal and interest), interest rate risk (i.e., market price, cash flow variability, and reinvestment risk due to changes in market interest rates) and equity risk (i.e., the risk arising from",

          "chunk_text": "## OTHER ITEMS\n\nINSURANCE. The run-off insurance operations of North American Life and Health (NALH) primarily include Employers Reassurance Corporation (ERAC) and Union Fidelity Life Insurance Company (UFLIC). ERAC primarily assumes long-term care insurance and life insurance from numerous cedents under various types of reinsurance treaties and stopped accepting new policies after 2008. UFLIC primarily assumes long-term care insurance, structured settlement annuities with and without life contingencies and variable annuities from Genworth Financial Inc.(Genworth) and has been closed to new business since 2004. The vast majority of NALH's reinsurance exposures are long-duration arrangements that still involve substantial levels of premium collections and benefit payments even though ERAC and UFLIC have not entered into new reinsurance treaties in more than a decade. These long-duration arrangements involve a number of direct writers and contain a range of risk transfer provisions and other contractual elements. In many instances, these arrangements do not transfer to us 100 percent of the risk embodied in the encompassed underlying policies issued by the direct writers. Furthermore, we cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies.\n\nOur run-off insurance liabilities and annuity benefits primarily comprise a liability for future policy benefits for those insurance contract claims not yet incurred and claim reserves for claims that have been incurred or are estimated to have been incurred but not yet reported. The insurance liabilities and annuity benefits amounted to $37.2 billion and $42.2 billion and primarily relate to individual long- term care insurance reserves of $21.7 billion and $21.3 billion and structured settlement annuities and life insurance reserves of $10.3 billion and $10.7 billion, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The decrease in insurance liabilities and annuity benefits of $5.0 billion from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 is primarily due to an adjustment of $4.8 billion resulting from the higher margin from the 2021 premium deficiency test and the decline in unrealized gains on investment securities that would result in a premium deficiency should those gains be realized.\n\nIn addition to NALH, Electric Insurance Company (EIC) is a property and casualty insurance company primarily providing insurance to GE and its employees with net claim reserves of $0.2 billion and $0.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n\nWe regularly monitor emerging experience in our run-off insurance operations and industry developments to identify trends that may help us refine our reserve assumptions. We believe recent elevated mortality across our portfolio and lower long-term care insurance claims are short term in nature and attributable to COVID-19. However, the effects of COVID-19, including the continued emergence of variants and success of vaccinations, remain uncertain and may result in variability in levels of future mortality and long-term care insurance claims activity, including changes in policyholder behavior (e.g., policyholder willingness to enter long-term care facilities or seek care at home), among others. These monitoring activities also allow us to evaluate opportunities to reduce our insurance risk profile and improve the results of our run-off insurance operations. Such opportunities may include the pursuit of future premium rate increases and benefit reductions on long-term care insurance contracts in accordance with our reinsurance contracts with our ceding companies; recapture and reinsurance transactions to reduce risk where economically justified; investment strategies to improve asset and liability matching and enhance investment portfolio yields; and managing our expense levels.\n\n## Key Portfolio Characteristics\n\nLong-term care insurance contracts. The long-term care insurance contracts we reinsure provide coverage at varying levels of benefits to policyholders and may include attributes that could result in claimants being on claim for longer periods or at higher daily claim costs, or alternatively limiting the premium paying period, compared to contracts with a lower level of benefits. For example, policyholders with a lifetime benefit period could receive coverage up to the specified daily maximum as long as the policyholder is claim eligible and receives care for covered services; inflation protection options increase the daily maximums to protect the policyholder from the rising cost of care with some options providing automatic annual increases of 3% to 5% or policyholder elected inflation-indexed increases for increased premium; joint life policies provide coverage for two lives which permit either life under a single contract to receive benefits at the same time or separately; and premium payment options may limit the period over which the policyholder pays premiums while still receiving coverage after premium payments cease, which may limit the impact of our benefit from future premium rate increases.\n\nThe ERAC long-term care insurance portfolio comprises more than two-thirds of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is assumed from approximately 30 ceding companies through various types of reinsurance and retrocession contracts having complex terms and conditions. Compared to the overall long-term care insurance block, it has a lower average attained age and more policies (and covered lives, as over one-third of the policies are joint life policies) with lifetime benefit periods and/or with inflation protection options which may result in a higher potential for future claims.\n\nThe UFLIC long-term care insurance block comprises the remainder of our total long-term care insurance reserves and is more mature with policies that are more uniform, as it is assumed from a single ceding company, Genworth, and has fewer policies with lifetime benefit periods, no joint life policies and slightly more policies with inflation protection options.\n\nPresented in the table below are GAAP and statutory reserve balances and key attributes of our long-term care insurance portfolio.",

      "question": "How does GE's quantitative presentation of claim reserves in its insurance liabilities table align with its methodology for estimating these reserves and the broader accounting framework for insurance liabilities, particularly in terms of actuarial assumptions and the treatment of future obligations?",
      "answer": "GE presents its claim reserves as $4,546 million (2021) and $4,393 million (2020) in the insurance liabilities table, indicating a relatively stable level of incurred but unpaid claims. The company explains that these reserves are established when a claim is incurred and are based on the present value of expected future payments and adjustment expenses, derived from actual claim facts and historical experience. This aligns with the broader accounting framework, where claim reserves are part of long-duration insurance contracts and are estimated using actuarial assumptions such as morbidity, claim termination rates, and benefit utilization. The reserves are periodically reviewed and adjusted as necessary, with changes reflected in earnings. This comprehensive approach ensures that the reserves are consistent with both the quantitative disclosures in the liabilities table and the qualitative actuarial and accounting standards applied across the insurance portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "Our run-off insurance operations have approximately $0.8 billion of assets held by states or other regulatory bodies in statutorily required deposit accounts, and approximately $31.0 billion of assets held in trust accounts associated with reinsurance contracts and reinsurance security trust agreements in place between either ERAC or UFLIC as the reinsuring entity and a number of ceding insurers. Assets in these trusts are held by an independent trustee for the benefit of the ceding insurer, and are subject to various investment guidelines as set forth in the respective reinsurance contracts and trust agreements. Some of these trust agreements may allow a ceding company to withdraw trust assets from the trust and hold these assets on its balance sheet, in an account under its control for the benefit of ERAC or UFLIC which might allow the ceding company to exercise investment control over such assets.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates. Our insurance reserves include the following key accounting estimates and assumptions described below.\n\nFuture policy benefit reserves . Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions including, but not limited to, morbidity (i.e., frequency and severity of claim, including claim termination rates and benefit utilization rates); morbidity improvement (i.e., assumed rate of improvement in morbidity in the future); mortality (i.e., life expectancy or longevity); mortality improvement (i.e., assumed rate that mortality is expected to reduce over time); policyholder persistency or lapses (i.e., the length of time a policy will remain in force); anticipated premium increases or benefit reductions associated with future in-force rate actions, including actions that are: (a) approved and not yet implemented, (b) filed but not yet approved, and (c) estimated on future filings through 2030, on long-term care insurance policies; and interest rates. Assumptions are locked-in throughout the remaining life of a contract unless a premium deficiency develops.\n\nClaim reserves . Claim reserves are established when a claim is incurred and represents our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustment expenses. Key inputs include actual known facts about the claim, such as the benefits available and cause of disability of the claimant, as well as assumptions derived from our actual historical experience and expected future changes in experience factors. Claim reserves are evaluated periodically for potential changes in loss estimates with the support of qualified actuaries, and any changes are recorded in earnings in the period in which they are determined.\n\nReinsurance recoverables . We cede insurance risk to third-party reinsurers for a portion of our insurance contracts, primarily on longterm care insurance policies, and record receivables for estimated recoveries as we are not relieved from our primary obligation to policyholders or cedents. These receivables are estimated in a manner consistent with the future policy benefit reserves and claim reserves. Reserves ceded to reinsurers, net of allowance, were $2.7 billion and $2.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the caption All other assets in our Statement of Financial Position.\n\nPremium Deficiency Testing . We annually perform premium deficiency testing in the third quarter in the aggregate across our run-off insurance portfolio. The premium deficiency testing assesses the adequacy of future policy benefit reserves, net of unamortized capitalized acquisition costs, using current assumptions without provision for adverse deviation. A comprehensive review of premium deficiency assumptions is a complex process and depends on a number of factors, many of which are interdependent and require evaluation individually and in the aggregate across all insurance products. The vast majority of our run-off insurance operations consists of reinsurance from multiple ceding insurance entities pursuant to treaties having complex terms and conditions. Premium deficiency testing relies on claim and policy information provided by these ceding entities and considers the reinsurance treaties and underlying policies. In order to utilize that information for purposes of completing experience studies covering all key assumptions, we perform detailed procedures to conform and validate the data received from the ceding entities. Our long-term care insurance business includes coverage where credible claim experience for higher attained ages is still emerging, and to the extent future experience deviates from current expectations, new projections of claim costs extending over the expected life of the policies may be required. Significant uncertainties exist in making projections for these long-term care insurance contracts, which requires that we consider a wide range of possible outcomes.\n\nThe primary assumptions used in the premium deficiency tests include:\n\nMorbidity . Morbidity assumptions used in estimating future policy benefit reserves are based on estimates of expected incidences of disability among policyholders and the costs associated with these policyholders asserting claims under their contracts, and these estimates account for any expected future morbidity improvement. For long-term care exposures, estimating expected future costs includes assessments of incidence (probability of a claim), utilization (amount of available benefits expected to be incurred) and continuance (how long the claim will last). Prior to 2017, premium deficiency assumptions considered the risk of anti-selection by including issue age adjustments to morbidity based on an actuarial assumption that long-term care policies issued to younger individuals would exhibit lower expected incidences and claim costs than those issued to older policyholders. Recent claim experience and the development of reconstructed claim cost curves indicated issue age differences had minimal impact on claim cost projections, and, accordingly, beginning in 2017, issue age adjustments were eliminated in developing morbidity assumptions. Higher morbidity increases, while lower morbidity decreases, the present value of expected future benefit payments.",

          "chunk_text": "We estimate expected credit losses based on relevant information about past events, including historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount. When measuring expected credit losses, we pool assets with similar country risk and credit risk characteristics. Changes in the relevant information may significantly affect the estimates of expected credit losses.\n\nINVENTORIES. All inventories are stated at lower of cost or realizable values. Cost of inventories is primarily determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis. See Note 5 for further information.\n\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. The cost of property, plant and equipment is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over its estimated economic life. See Note 6 for further information.\n\nLEASE ACCOUNTING FOR LESSEE ARRANGEMENTS. At lease commencement, we record a lease liability and corresponding right-of-use (ROU) asset. Options to extend the lease are included as part of the ROU lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain the Company will exercise the option. We have elected to include lease and non-lease components in determining our lease liability for all leased assets except our vehicle leases. Non-lease components are generally services that the lessor performs for the Company associated with the leased asset. The present value of our lease liability is determined using our incremental collateralized borrowing rate at lease inception. For leases with an initial term of 12 months or less, an ROU asset and lease liability is not recognized and lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We test ROU assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the asset may be impaired.\n\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. We test goodwill at least annually for impairment at the reporting unit level. We recognize an impairment charge if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value. When a portion of a reporting unit is disposed, goodwill is allocated to the gain or loss on disposition based on the relative fair values of the business or businesses disposed and the portion of the reporting unit that will be retained.\n\nFor other intangible assets that are not deemed indefinite-lived, cost is generally amortized on a straight-line basis over the asset's estimated economic life, except for individually significant customer-related intangible assets that are amortized in relation to total related sales. Amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In these circumstances, they are tested for impairment based on undiscounted cash flows and, if impaired, written down to estimated fair value based on either discounted cash flows or appraised values. See Note 7 for further information.\n\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING. We use derivatives to manage a variety of risks, including risks related to interest rates, foreign exchange, certain equity investments and commodity prices. Accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that, at inception and over the term of the arrangement, the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting. In evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting, we test effectiveness at inception and each reporting period thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset, within a specified range, changes in the fair value of the hedged item. If fair value changes fail this test, we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively. Fair values of both the derivative instrument and the hedged item are calculated using internal valuation models incorporating marketbased assumptions, subject to third-party confirmation, as applicable. See Note 20 for further information.\n\nDEFERRED INCOME TAXES. Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases, as well as from net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when those taxes are paid or recovered. Deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable on taxable income in future years. We evaluate the recoverability of these future tax deductions and credits by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. To the extent we consider it more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be recovered, a valuation allowance is established. Deferred taxes, as needed, are provided for our investment in affiliates and associated companies when we plan to remit those earnings. See Note 14 for further information.\n\nINSURANCE LIABILITIES AND ANNUITY BENEFITS. Our run-off insurance operations include providing insurance and reinsurance for life and health risks and providing certain annuity products. Primary product types include long-term care, structured settlement annuities, life and disability insurance contracts and investment contracts. Insurance contracts are contracts with significant mortality and/or morbidity risks, while investment contracts are contracts without such risks.\n\nLiabilities for traditional long-duration insurance contracts include both future policy benefit reserves and claims reserves. Future policy benefit reserves represent the present value of future policy benefits less the present value of future gross premiums based on actuarial assumptions. Liabilities for investment contracts equal the account value, that is, the amount that accrues to the benefit of the contract or policyholder including credited interest and assessments through the financial statement date.\n\nClaim reserves are established when a claim is incurred or is estimated to have been incurred and represent our best estimate of the present value of the ultimate obligations for future claim payments and claim adjustments expenses.\n\nTo the extent that unrealized gains on specific investment securities supporting our insurance contracts would result in a premium deficiency, should those gains be realized, an increase in future policy benefit reserves is recorded, with an offsetting after-tax reduction to net unrealized gains recorded in other comprehensive income.",

Additionally, the segment faced asset exposure risks tied to the commercial aerospace industry, as RTX monitored recoverability of assets and off-balance sheet exposures due to reduced demand for air travel (page_92).

As  a  result  of  COVID-19,  governments,  businesses  and  individuals  have  taken  actions  such  as  instituting  lockdowns, quarantines, border closings and other travel restrictions and requirements, adopting remote working and reducing business and leisure travel, which collectively led to an unprecedented decline in demand for commercial air travel. The unprecedented decrease in air travel adversely affected our airline and airframer customers and their demand for our products and services of our Collins Aerospace and Pratt &amp; Whitney businesses. Refer to 'Note 1: Basis of Presentation and Summary of Accounting Principles' for further  details.  While  we  have  seen  indications  that  commercial  air  travel  is  recovering,  we  continue  to  closely  monitor  our commercial aerospace assets for recoverability and our off-balance sheet exposures.

      "answer": "RTX's future income tax benefits valuation allowance increased from $605 million in 2018 to $825 million in 2021, with notable fluctuations driven by additions and reductions tied to acquisitions, goodwill, and tax planning strategies. Despite this upward trend, RTX's management asserts confidence in realizing these benefits over time, citing projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. However, the company acknowledges that in jurisdictions where realization is uncertain due to factors like tax carryforward expiration or insufficient projected earnings, valuation allowances are applied to reduce deferred tax assets to expected realizable amounts, particularly for tax credit and loss carryforwards. This reflects a nuanced approach where RTX balances optimism in long-term realizability with conservative adjustments where risks are higher.",

For  additional  information  related  to  the  Raytheon  Merger,  see  'Note  2:  Business Acquisitions, Dispositions, Goodwill and Intangible Assets' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\n\nCosts incurred for engineering and development of aerospace products under contracts with customers are capitalized as contract fulfillment costs, to the extent recoverable from the associated contract margin and customer funding, and subsequently amortized as  the  OEM  products  are  delivered  to  the  customer.  The  estimation  of  contract  costs,  and  margin,  considered  as  part  of  this recoverability  assessment  requires  significant  judgment.  See  'Note  1:  Basis  of  Presentation  and  Summary  of  Accounting Principles' within Item 8 of this Form 10-K for further discussion. We regularly assess capitalized contract fulfillment costs for impairment. In 2020, we recognized impairment of $111 million related to contract fulfillment costs.\n\nIncome Taxes. Management believes that our earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related future income tax benefits, which may be realized over an extended period of time. For those jurisdictions where the expiration date of tax carryforwards or the projected operating results indicate that realization is not likely, a valuation allowance is provided.\n\nIn  assessing  the  need  for  a  valuation  allowance,  we  consider  available  positive  and  negative  evidence  including  past  operating results,  projections  of  future  taxable  income,  the  feasibility  of  ongoing  tax  planning  strategies  and  the  realizability  of  tax  loss carryforwards.  Our  projections  of  future  taxable  income  include  estimates  and  assumptions  regarding  our  volume,  pricing,  and costs, as well as the timing and amount of reversals of taxable temporary differences. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be affected by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a portion of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would reduce such amounts through an increase to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made or when tax law changes are enacted. Conversely, if we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, we would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a decrease to tax expense in the period in which that determination is made.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business there is inherent uncertainty in quantifying our income tax positions. Significant judgment is required when assessing our income tax positions and in determining our tax expense and benefits. Each quarter, management",

      "answer": "RTX reported a 61% year-over-year increase in bookings in one segment (from $9,716M in 2020 to $15,650M in 2021) and a 33% increase in another segment (from $10,568M in 2020 to $14,019M in 2021), reflecting strong order growth. This aligns with their strategic focus on backlog as a forward-looking indicator of sales growth, as bookings feed into backlog. With total backlog rising from $150B in 2020 to $156B in 2021, the surge in bookings supports the growth in backlog, indicating a healthy pipeline of future revenue. Thus, the significant booking increases across segments directly support RTX\u2019s strategic emphasis on backlog as a key performance measure.",

See Results of Operations below for our definition of the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss), which are not defined measures under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) and may be calculated differently by other companies.\n\nWe also focus on backlog as a key financial performance measure of our forward-looking sales growth. Total backlog was $156 billion  and  $150  billion  as  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  respectively.  Backlog,  which  is  equivalent  to  our  remaining performance obligations (RPO) for our sales contracts, represents the aggregate dollar value of firm orders for which products have not  been  provided  or  service  has  not  been  performed  and  excludes  unexercised  contract  options  and  potential  orders  under ordering-type  contracts  (e.g.,  indefinite-delivery,  indefinite-quantity  (IDIQ)  type  contracts).  Segment  backlog  does  not  include intercompany backlog. Backlog generally increases with bookings and/or orders and generally decreases as sales are recognized on these bookings and is affected by changes in foreign exchange rates, as well as contract cancellations and terminations, and cost underruns on cost-type contracts.\n\nIn addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating income and cash. We focus on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and measures to assess our cash generation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital, such as free cash flow (FCF), both of which are not defined measures under U.S. GAAP and may be calculated differently by other companies.\n\nConsidered together, we believe these metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareowner value. We feel these measures are balanced among long-term and short-term performance, efficiency and growth. We also use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes.\n\nA discussion of our results of operations and financial condition follows below in Results of Operations, Segment Review, and Liquidity and Financial Condition.\n\n## RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nAs described in our 'Cautionary Note Concerning Factors That May Affect Future Results' in this Form 10-K, our period-to-period comparisons of our results, particularly at a segment level, may not be indicative of our future operating results.

However, the company also acknowledges significant uncertainty in predicting future liabilities due to variables like filing rates, disease classifications, and judicial outcomes, which could materially impact both the recorded liability and future financial performance.

      "question": "What does the pattern of repositioning and other charges from 2021 to 2023\u2014$569M in 2021, $1,266M in 2022, and $860M in 2023\u2014suggest about Honeywell's restructuring efforts, especially in light of the $294M cash spending in 2023 and the strategic business realignment announced in October 2023?",
      "answer": "The fluctuation in repositioning and other charges\u2014rising sharply to $1,266M in 2022 and declining to $860M in 2023\u2014suggests that Honeywell underwent significant restructuring activity in 2022, followed by a more measured execution phase in 2023, which aligns with the $294M cash outflow reported for repositioning in that year. The October 2023 announcement of a strategic business realignment, which included forming two new segments and renaming existing ones, likely reflects the culmination of these restructuring efforts. The reduction in charges from 2022 to 2023 may indicate that the company transitioned from planning and initiating restructuring actions to implementing them with more controlled spending. This trajectory provides insight into how financial commitments to strategic realignment evolved over time, with implications for both near-term cash flow commitments and long-term operational design.",

      "question": "How has the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment evolved from 2021 to 2023 in terms of financial performance, organizational structure, and restructuring investments, and what does this evolution suggest about Honeywell's strategic focus for this business unit?",
      "answer": "The Safety and Productivity Solutions segment experienced a decline in net repositioning charges from $268 million in 2021 to $188 million in 2022 and further to $112 million in 2023, indicating a decreasing emphasis on restructuring costs over time. In July 2022, Honeywell realigned business units within the segment, merging the Safety and Retail business with Advanced Sensing Technologies to form the Sensing and Safety Technologies business unit, reflecting a strategic reorganization to enhance integration and focus. Despite this reorganization, the segment continued to incur significant restructuring costs, including $41 million in asset impairments and 5,854 workforce reductions in 2023, primarily tied to productivity and transformation initiatives. This combination of structural change and ongoing investment in restructuring suggests that Honeywell is seeking to streamline and refocus the Safety and Productivity Solutions segment for long-term efficiency and competitiveness.",

      "question": "How does Emerson's treatment of inventory step-up amortization in acquisition-related costs, tax implications, and pro forma financial adjustments collectively impact the company's financial reporting and strategic evaluation of the National Instruments acquisition?",
      "answer": "Emerson recorded $231 of acquisition-related inventory step-up amortization in Corporate and Other expenses for 2024, directly affecting operating profit. This amortization also had tax implications, as the Test & Measurement segment noted a lower tax benefit due to this expense, with $213 of inventory step-up amortization included in the pro forma financials for the prior year. Additionally, the pro forma results for the year ended September 30, 2023, included $213 of inventory step-up amortization as part of the ongoing adjustments to reflect the acquisition as if it had occurred earlier, indicating that the amortization is a recurring cost that must be considered in assessing the acquisition's true financial impact. Together, these figures show that inventory step-up amortization significantly affects both GAAP profitability and tax positioning, while also shaping the pro forma narrative used to evaluate the strategic success of the NI acquisition.",

      "answer": "Raytheon aligns its pension and postretirement benefit (PRB) cost recovery with its contract pricing strategy, particularly under U.S. government contracts, where it expects to recover these costs through the pricing of its products and services (page_46). This is consistent with the revenue recognition methodology described in the document, where substantially all of Raytheon\u2019s defense contracts recognize revenue over time using a percentage-of-completion basis, typically tied to costs incurred, including labor, materials, and subcontractor costs (page_79). This cost-based pricing and revenue recognition approach allows Raytheon to incorporate pension and PRB expenses\u2014adjusted under the FAS/CAS operating adjustment\u2014into the total estimated costs of fulfilling contracts. This alignment is further supported by the significant contract awards detailed in the Raytheon segment, such as the $639 million for AN/SPY-6(V) radars and $5.7 billion in classified contracts (page_53), which reflect the scale and nature of long-term, cost-driven defense contracts that enable such cost recovery mechanisms.",

A contract's transaction price is allocated to each distinct performance obligation and recognized as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. When there are multiple performance obligations within a contract, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on its standalone selling price when available. If standalone selling price is not available, we estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation, which is generally based on an expected cost-plus-a-margin approach.\n\nWe  consider  the  contractual  consideration  payable  by  the  customer  and  assess  variable  consideration  that  may  affect  the  total  transaction  price,  including contractual  discounts,  contract  incentive  payments,  estimates  of  award  fees,  flight  hours,  aircraft  landings  or  other  customer  usage  activities  on  long-term maintenance contracts, and other sources of variable consideration, when determining the transaction price of each contract.

Consideration payable to a customer may include cash amounts we are obligated to pay or expect to pay a customer, as well as credits or other items that can be applied against amounts owed to us.

These estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance, and our best judgment at the time. We also consider whether our contracts contain a significant financing component, which they generally do not.\n\nTiming of the satisfaction of performance obligations varies across our businesses due to our diverse product and service mix, customer base, and contractual terms.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied as of a point-in-time for certain aerospace components, engines, and spare parts. Revenue is recognized when control of the product transfers to the customer, generally upon product shipment. Since billing also typically occurs upon product shipment, we generally do not have Contract assets or Contract liabilities balances related to point-in-time sales.\n\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time if the customer receives the benefits as we perform work, if the customer controls the asset as it is being produced (continuous transfer of control), or if the product being produced for the customer has no alternative use and we have a contractual right to payment for performance to date. We recognize revenue on an over-time basis for substantially all defense contracts and certain long-term aerospace OEM and aftermarket contracts.\n\nSubstantially all of our defense business revenue, which primarily relates to our Raytheon segment, and to a lesser extent Pratt &amp; Whitney and Collins, is recognized over time because of the continuous transfer of control to our customers. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized on a percentage-ofcompletion basis generally using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress. Incurred costs represent work performed, which correspond with and best depict transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs can include labor, materials, subcontractors' costs, or other direct costs and indirect costs. Our contracts with the U.S. government are typically subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and are priced based on estimated or actual costs of producing goods or providing services. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services provided under U.S. government contracts. The pricing for non-U.S. government contracts is based on the specific negotiations with each customer. Under the typical payment terms of our U.S. government fixed-price contracts, the customer pays us either performance-based payments (PBPs) or progress payments. PBPs are interim payments equal to a negotiated percentage of the contract price based on quantifiable measures of performance or on the achievement of specified events or milestones. Progress payments are interim payments up to 80-90% of costs incurred as the work progresses. Because the customer retains a portion of the contract price until completion of the contract, our U.S. government fixed-price contracts generally result in revenue recognized in excess of billings which we present as Contract assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. For our U.S. government cost-type contracts, the customer generally pays us for our costs incurred within a short period of time. For non-U.S. government contracts, we typically receive interim payments as work progresses, although for some contracts, we may be entitled to receive an advance payment. Such advances are not considered a significant financing component because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract and to protect us from the other party failing to adequately complete some or all of its obligations under the contract. We recognize a liability for advance payments in excess of revenue recognized and present it as Contract liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n\nFor certain of our long-term aftermarket contracts, revenue is recognized over the contract period. We generally account for such contracts as a series of daily performance obligations to stand ready to provide spare parts, product maintenance, and aftermarket services. These arrangements include the sale of spare parts with integral services to our customers, and are generally classified as Services sales, with the corresponding costs classified in Cost of sales - services, within the Consolidated Statement of Operations.

While the ultimate liability for pension and PRB costs under FAS and CAS is similar, the pattern of cost recognition is different. Over time, we generally ex pect to recover the related Raytheon pension and PRB liabilities through the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. government. Collins and Pratt &amp; Whitney generally record pension and PRB expense on a FAS basis.\n\nGiven the nature of our business, we believe that Total net sales and Operating profit (loss) (and the related operating profit (loss) margin percentage), which we disclose and discuss at the segment level, are most relevant to an understanding of management's view of our segment performance, as described below.\n\nWe provide the organic change in Net sales and Operating profit (loss) for our segments as discussed above in 'Results of Operations.' We believe that these nonGAAP measures are useful to investors because they provide transparency to the underlying performance of our business, which allows for better year-over-year comparability.

      "answer": "The $6.2 billion organic increase in total cost of sales in 2024 (from page 41) is directly tied to increased activity at Pratt & Whitney, among other segments. According to page 46, Pratt & Whitney's segment performance includes the transactional impact of foreign exchange hedging, which significantly affects its operating results. Meanwhile, page 79 explains that Pratt & Whitney recognizes revenue from long-term aftermarket contracts over time using a percentage-of-completion method based on incurred costs. This means that as costs rise (as seen in the $6.2 billion increase), revenue is recognized progressively, aligning cost growth with revenue timing. Thus, the cost increase is not only a reflection of higher operational activity but also interacts with Pratt & Whitney's revenue recognition framework, which could affect the timing and volatility of reported segment profitability.",

The change in net EAC adjustments was primarily due to improvement in net EAC adjustments related to certain fixed price development contracts. Included in the change in net EAC adjustments was a benefit from the absence of a $51 million unfavorable adjustment in 2023 related to significant contract options exercised, which was offset by a $53 million unfavorable EAC adjustment in the third quarter of 2024 related to cost increases on a classified program.\n\nThe decrease in net sales and operating profit due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily relates to the sale of the CIS business completed in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe decrease in Other operating profit in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily driven by $0.6 billion related to the Raytheon Contract Termination initiated in the second quarter of 2024, partially offset by a $0.4 billion gain on the sale of the CIS business in the first quarter of 2024, and a $0.1 billion net benefit primarily related to reserve and contract loss provision adjustments recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024 as a result of restarting work under certain contracts with a Middle East customer.\n\n## 2023 Compared with 2022\n\nThe organic net sales increase of $1.3 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to higher net sales of $0.5 billion from advanced technology programs, $0.3 billion from air and space defense systems programs, $0.2 billion from cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs, and $0.2 billion from naval power programs. The increase in advanced technology programs includes higher net sales on an advanced development program awarded in the third quarter of 2022, and higher net sales on certain classified programs awarded in 2022. The increase in air and space defense systems programs includes higher net sales on the StormBreaker program, driven by awards in the first and fourth quarters of 2023 and higher net sales on the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) program, driven by an award in the second quarter of 2023. The increase in cybersecurity, intelligence and services programs was driven by certain classified programs as well as federal and civil programs. The increase in naval power programs was due to higher volumes on Naval Strike Missile and AIM-9X programs.\n\nThe organic operating profit decrease of $0.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to an unfavorable change in mix and other performance of $0.1 billion, and an unfavorable net change in  EAC adjustments of $0.1 billion,  partially  offset  by  higher  volume  of  $0.2  billion.  The  unfavorable  change  in  mix   and  other performance was primarily driven by an expected decline in certain higher margin international programs and higher volume on various lower margin programs including early production phase programs. The net change in EAC adjustments was primarily due to unfavorable changes in net EAC adjustments related to certain fix ed  price  development  contracts  and  approx imately  $50  million  of  unfavorable  EAC  adjustments  related  to  significant  contract  options  ex ercised  in  2023.  The increase in volume was principally driven by the higher net sales discussed above.\n\nThe increase in Other operating profit in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily driven by the absence of a $42 million charge in 2022 associated with a divestiture of a small non-core naval power business, with the remaining change spread across multiple items.\n\nThe decrease in net sales due to acquisitions / divestitures, net in 2023 compared to 2022 primarily relates to the divestiture of a small non-core naval power business in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nRestructuring actions relate to ongoing cost reduction efforts including workforce reductions.\n\nDefense Backlog and Bookings - Backlog was $63 billion at December 31, 2024 compared to $52 billion at December 31, 2023. Included in the change in backlog was a $1.1 billion reduction related to the sale of the CIS business and a $0.9 billion increase related to restarting work on certain contracts with a Middle East customer, as discussed above. In addition to a number of smaller bookings, in 2024, Raytheon booked $2.4 billion to provide Patriot Air Defense systems to G ermany, $1.9 billion for  low-rate  initial  production  of  L TAMDS for the  U.S. Army and  Poland, $1.6 billion to provide  Standard  Missile 3 (SM-3) to the  U.S.  Navy and international customers, $1.4 billion to provide G uidance Enhanced Missiles (GEM-T) for NATO Support and Procurement Agency (NSPA), $1.2 billion to provide AMRAAM to the U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force and international customers, $1.0 billion to provide Evolved SeaSparrow Missile (ESSM) for the U.S. Navy and international consortium partners, $848 million to provide Patriot Air Defense systems, including GEM-T missiles, to Romania, $763 million to provide Stinger missiles to NSPA and Poland, $737 million to provide AIM-9X Sidewinder short-range air-to-air missiles for the U.S. Navy,",

Commercial aerospace operating profit in 2023 also benefited from two favorable contract matters totaling $0.1 billion, which was partially offset by the absence of a prior year $50 million favorable contract adjustment resulting from a contract modification on a commercial aftermarket contract. Military operating profit was relatively consistent compared to 2022. The increase from the military sales volume was more than offset by higher production costs and an unfavorable EAC adjustment of $0.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023. Higher research and development expenses were partially offset by lower selling, general, and administrative ex penses.\n\nThe change in Other operating profit (loss) of $2.9 billion in 2023 compared to 2022 was primarily due to the charge recognized in the third quarter of 2023 related to the Powder Metal Matter of $2.9 billion and a $0.2 billion charge related to a customer insolvency during the second quarter of 2023, partially offset by the absence of $0.2 billion of pre-tax  charges recorded in the first quarter of 2022 related to global sanctions on and export controls with respect to Russia.

      "question": "How did RTX's military operating profit performance in 2023 reflect both the challenges from production cost pressures and the opportunities from increased F135 sustainment volume, considering the year-over-year changes and segment-specific dynamics?",
      "answer": "RTX's military operating profit in 2023 was relatively consistent compared to 2022, despite an increase in military sales of $0.3 billion primarily driven by higher F135 sustainment volume. However, this increase was offset by higher production costs and an unfavorable EAC adjustment of approximately $60 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, which constrained operating profit growth. Looking at the prior year comparison, military operating profit in 2022 decreased $0.4 billion compared to 2021, mainly due to lower military sales driven by reduced material receipts and decreased volume. This decline was partially offset by favorable mix in 2022. The 2023 performance reflects a stabilization in military operating profit despite ongoing cost pressures, suggesting that the increased F135 sustainment volume helped counterbalance these challenges and marked a shift from the downward trend observed in 2022.",

      "answer": "Pratt & Whitney faces significant operational risks tied to the Powder Metal Matter, which resulted in a $2.6 billion net reduction in total cost of sales and caused increased engine removals, inspections, and costs. This issue threatens customer satisfaction and contract profitability, especially for the Geared Turbofan engine family. At the same time, the segment holds $196 billion in Remaining Performance Obligations (RPO), with 45% tied to long-term commercial aerospace maintenance contracts, indicating a strong strategic position and future revenue visibility over up to 20 years. Despite these risks and long-term commitments, Pratt & Whitney contributed $20.53 billion in business segment sales in 2022, making it a key revenue driver for RTX.

      "answer": "RTX excludes the amortization of customer contractual obligations\u2014related to loss-making or below-market contracts acquired\u2014from both their segment performance evaluation and organic change metrics. In segment reporting (page_109), these acquisition accounting adjustments are explicitly not part of management\u2019s evaluation of segment results. Similarly, in the organic change analysis (page_36), these amortization costs are excluded from Net Sales, Cost of Sales, and Operating Profit to provide better year-over-year comparability. Additionally, page_49 reinforces this treatment by including this amortization under broader acquisition accounting adjustments, which are consistently separated from operational performance indicators across the company\u2019s financial reporting.",

      "question": "How does 3M's treatment of 'Other Expense (Income), Net' across its consolidated operating performance, segment-level reporting, and discontinued operations reflect its overall financial volatility and strategic adjustments in 2024 compared to prior years?",
      "answer": "In 2024, 3M's 'Other Expense (Income), Net' was $3 million in the consolidated operating performance (page_45), reflecting minimal impact on overall earnings. However, at the segment level (page_111), the 'Other' category showed a net expense of $6 million, indicating slight drag from non-core activities. In contrast, discontinued operations (page_55) reported $44 million in other expense, net, signaling a more significant negative impact from divested or winding-down businesses. This divergence suggests that while core operations remained relatively stable, discontinued and residual activities contributed disproportionately to financial volatility, aligning with 3M\u2019s strategic refocusing efforts.",

      "question": "How does 3M's $0.77 per share restructuring benefit in 2024 compare to its earlier divestiture-related restructuring costs, particularly the $41 million charge in 2022, and what does this shift indicate about the company's transformation journey?",
      "answer": "In 2024, 3M recognized a restructuring benefit of $0.77 per share, driven by productivity initiatives and a $30 million cumulative translation adjustment restructuring benefit from the liquidation of certain entities. This contrasts sharply with the $41 million divestiture-related restructuring charge recorded in 2022, as disclosed in the Total Company GAAP amounts. The shift from a cost center to a source of earnings suggests that 3M's earlier restructuring actions, including divestiture-related activities, have transitioned from incurring costs to delivering operational efficiencies and financial benefits. This transformation reflects progress in the company\u2019s structural reorganization strategy, moving from the implementation phase\u2014marked by charges like the $41 million in 2022\u2014to a phase where restructuring efforts are now contributing positively to earnings.",

        "Hop 1: [MMM](page_111) \u2192 Divestiture-Related Restructuring Actions: The 2022 GAAP financial statement on page 111 shows a $41 million charge for divestiture-related restructuring actions, indicating a significant cost associated with restructuring during that year.",
        "Hop 2: [MMM](page_21) \u2192 Divestiture-Related Restructuring Actions: In 2024, page 21 highlights a $0.77 per share restructuring benefit, including a $30 million cumulative translation adjustment benefit from entity liquidations, showing a reversal in restructuring impact from cost to gain.",
        "Hop 3: [MMM](page_24) \u2192 Divestiture-Related Restructuring Actions: Page 24's 2022 financial summary confirms the $41 million restructuring charge was part of the company's broader special items, further validating its materiality and the significance of its absence in 2024's restructuring narrative."

The year-on-year impact of non-Solventum related transition services agreements is included in acquisitions/divestitures as further described below.\n\nIn 2023, the following components impacted earnings (loss) from continuing operations per diluted share year-on-year:\n\n- Declines in disposable respirator demand year-on-year and the 2022 exit of operations in Russia negatively impacted earnings (loss) per share by $0.38.\n- Remaining organic growth/productivity and other impacts resulted in a net year-on-year increase of $0.61 per share which was impacted by the following:\n- Benefits from spending discipline, sourcing actions, restructuring, higher selling prices and ongoing productivity actions\n- Lower sales volumes (particularly electronics/consumer retail); investments in growth, productivity, and sustainability;\n- manufacturing/supply chain headwinds; inflation impacts; China; and Europe's geopolitical impacts\n- In 2024 and 2023, lower defined benefit pension and postretirement service cost decreased expense year-on-year.\n\n## Restructuring and related charges:\n\n- 3M recorded restructuring pre-tax charges of $187 million, $415 million, and $16 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022 respectively, related to the 2023 to 2025 structural reorganization actions and 2020 through 2022 operational/marketing capability actions (refer to Note 6 for additional discussion). The 2024 pre-tax charge included a $30 million cumulative translation adjustment restructuring benefit as certain entities were substantially liquidated in the fourth quarter of 2024. That benefit is reflected in organic growth/productivity and other as described above. In addition, 3M recorded certain pre-tax adjustments, accelerated depreciation and other charges related to these actions of $44 million and $4 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. 3M also recorded restructuring charges in 2023 and 2024 for PFAS exit actions and in 2022 for divestiture-related restructuring actions as further described in Note 6 which are part of the manufactured PFAS products and divestiture-related restructuring actions special items, respectively (see the Certain amounts adjusted for special items - (non-GAAP measures) section below).\n\n## Foreign exchange impacts:\n\n- Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) decreased operating income from continuing operations by approximately $101 million (or a decrease of pre-tax income by approximately $104 million) year-on-year for 2024. Foreign currency impacts (net of hedging) increased operating loss from continuing operations by approximately $116 million (or a increase of pre-tax  loss by approx imately $111 million) year-on-year for 2023. These estimates include: (a) the effects of year-on-year changes in exchange rates on translating current period functional currency profits into U.S. dollars and on current period non-functional currency denominated purchases or transfers of goods between 3M operations, and (b) year-on-year changes in transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.\n\n\u2022",

      "question": "How does the $45 million net cost for significant litigation in 2024 impact MMM's operating income and earnings per share, and what does this reveal about the financial reporting treatment of litigation expenses across different sections of the filing?",
      "answer": "The $45 million net cost for significant litigation in 2024 directly reduced MMM's operating income, as shown in the Corporate and Unallocated section under special items on page 111. This expense was then carried through to the earnings per share (EPS) reconciliation on page 20, where it contributed to a $1.32 reduction in EPS. The amplification from $45 million in operating expense to a $1.32 EPS impact reflects both tax effects (applying the 16.6% effective tax rate mentioned on page 20) and the distribution of the cost across diluted shares. This analysis reveals that litigation costs are reported upfront in operating performance but then adjusted in EPS calculations, showing different financial reporting treatments depending on the metric being presented.",

        "Hop 1: MMM (page_111) \u2192 Net Costs for Significant Litigation: The $45 million net cost is explicitly listed under Corporate and Unallocated special items, directly reducing operating income.",

        "Hop 3: MMM (page_20) \u2192 Net Costs for Significant Litigation: The $45 million cost translates to a $1.32 reduction in EPS, showing how operating expenses flow through to per-share metrics after tax adjustments (16.6% effective tax rate) and share count considerations."

      "question": "How does the overall sales performance of MMM in 2024 reflect the regional and segment-level dynamics, particularly in light of the contrasting organic sales growth in Asia Pacific and the negative contributions from Europe, Middle East & Africa, as well as the divestiture impacts in the Consumer and Transportation and Electronics segments?",
      "answer": "MMM's total sales change in 2024 was a decline of 1.9%, as reported in the consolidated sales analysis. This decline was influenced by contrasting regional performances: Asia Pacific saw 1.2% organic growth, while Europe, Middle East & Africa experienced a 3.1% decline in organic sales. Additionally, segment-level data shows that the Consumer segment declined by 5.0% and Transportation and Electronics declined by 4.5%, with divestitures contributing negatively to both (-0.1% and -0.7%, respectively). Regionally, divestitures added 0.6% to growth globally, but this was offset by translation effects (-0.7%) and weak performance in key markets like Europe. Thus, the consolidated sales change reflects a complex interplay of regional headwinds, segment-specific challenges, and strategic divestitures.",

      "question": "How do Caterpillar's quarterly eliminations in the Corporate Items and Eliminations segment for Q4 2021 reconcile with the full-year 2021 inter-segment adjustments and consolidated sales figures, and what does this reveal about the relationship between segment reporting and consolidated financials?",
      "answer": "In Q4 2021, Caterpillar's Corporate Items and Eliminations segment reported inter-segment eliminations of **$1,239 million**, which contributed to the reconciliation of total segment sales of **$13,097 million** to the consolidated sales figure of **$13,798 million** (page_41). For the full year 2021, the Corporate Items and Eliminations segment showed inter-segment eliminations of **$4,556 million**, reconciling total segment sales of **$50,971 million** to consolidated sales of **$50,971 million** (page_35). This indicates that the full-year inter-segment eliminations offset entirely within the consolidated total, while in Q4, the eliminations reduced consolidated sales compared to total segment sales. The expense for Corporate Items and Eliminations in Q4 2021 was **$318 million**, which remained flat compared to Q4 2020 (page_45), suggesting consistent corporate-level expense treatment during the reconciliation process. These figures reveal that Caterpillar applies inter-segment eliminations differently across reporting periods, with Q4 2021 showing a net reduction in consolidated sales due to eliminations, while the full-year 2021 adjustments fully offset within the consolidated total, aligning with the company's segment and consolidated reporting methodology.",

The increase was mainly due to a favorable impact from returned or repossessed equipment and lower provision for credit losses at Cat Financial, partially offset by an increase in SG&amp;A expenses primarily due to higher short-term incentive compensation expense.\n\n## Corporate Items and Eliminations\n\nExpense for corporate items and eliminations was $318 million in the fourth quarter of 2021, about flat to the fourth quarter of 2020.\n\n## 2020 COMPARED WITH 2019\n\nFor discussions related to the consolidated sales and revenue and consolidated operating profit between 2020 and 2019, refer to Part II,  Item  7.

We expect that prior restructuring actions will result in an incremental benefit to operating costs, primarily Costs of goods sold and SG&amp;A expenses of about $75 million in 2022 compared with 2021.\n\nAdditional information related to restructuring costs is included in Note 25 - \"Restructuring Costs\" of Part II, Item 8 \"Financial Statements and Supplemental Data.\"\n\n## GLOSSARY OF TERMS\n\n1. Adjusted Operating Profit Margin - Operating profit excluding restructuring costs as a percent of sales and revenues.\n2. Adjusted Profit Per Share -  Profit  per  share  excluding  pension  and  OPEB  mark-to-market  gains/losses  and  restructuring income/costs.\n3. All  Other  Segment -  Primarily  includes  activities  such  as:  business  strategy;  product  management  and  development; manufacturing and sourcing of filters and fluids, undercarriage, ground-engaging tools, fluid transfer products, precision seals, rubber  sealing  and  connecting  components  primarily  for  Cat\u00ae  products;  parts  distribution;  integrated  logistics  solutions; distribution services responsible for dealer development and administration, including a wholly owned dealer in Japan; dealer portfolio  management  and  ensuring  the  most  efficient  and  effective  distribution  of  machines,  engines  and  parts;  brand management  and  marketing  strategy;  and  digital  investments  for  new  customer  and  dealer  solutions  that  integrate  data analytics with state-of-the-art digital technologies while transforming the buying experience.\n4. Consolidating  Adjustments -  Elimination  of  transactions  between  Machinery,  Energy  &amp;  Transportation  and  Financial Products.\n5. Construction Industries - A segment primarily responsible for supporting customers using machinery in infrastructure and building  construction  applications.  Responsibilities  include  business  strategy,  product  design,  product  management  and development, manufacturing, marketing and sales and product support. The product portfolio includes asphalt pavers; backhoe loaders; compactors; cold planers; compact track and multi-terrain loaders; mini, small, medium and large track excavators; motor graders; pipelayers; road reclaimers; skid steer loaders; telehandlers; small and medium track-type tractors; track-type loaders; utility vehicles; wheel excavators; compact, small and medium wheel loaders; and related parts and work tools.\n6. Corporate Items and Eliminations - Includes corporate-level expenses, timing differences (as some expenses are reported in segment  profit  on  a  cash  basis),  methodology  differences  between  segment  and  consolidated  external  reporting,  certain restructuring costs and inter-segment eliminations.",

      "question": "How does Caterpillar's treatment of interest expense from Financial Products across consolidated operations, segment reporting, and cash flow hedging disclosures reflect its overall financial risk exposure and cost management strategy?",
      "answer": "Caterpillar's interest expense from Financial Products is reported at $455 million in the consolidated income statement (2021), indicating a core operating cost. Segment reporting shows this expense is fully attributed to the Financial Products segment, highlighting its significance as a standalone cost center within the broader organization. Cash flow hedging disclosures reveal that interest rate contracts are used to manage this expense, with $28 million of gains/losses reclassified from AOCI into earnings during 2021, showing active risk mitigation. Together, these perspectives indicate that Caterpillar recognizes Financial Products' interest expense as a material, concentrated cost that is actively hedged to stabilize earnings.",

The business was formally classified as held for sale in Q2 2024 and sold to Dolby Laboratories for $441 million, as detailed in the discontinued operations note. Additionally, the cash flow statement reflected proceeds from the disposition of this business, along with Electric Insurance Company, totaling $0.5 billion within investing activities.
