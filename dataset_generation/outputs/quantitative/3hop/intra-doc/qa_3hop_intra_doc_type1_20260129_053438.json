      "question": "How does the growth in Amazon's international sales in 2021 relate to the increase in unit sales, and how does this relationship impact operating income in the International segment?",
      "answer": "Amazon's international sales grew by 22% in 2021, primarily driven by increased unit sales, which were supported by reduced pricing and shipping offers. This growth in unit sales also appears in the International segment's operating income discussion on page 24, where it is noted that increased unit sales partially offset rising fulfillment and shipping costs. However, despite this growth, the International segment moved from operating income to an operating loss in 2021 due to significant increases in fulfillment costs and marketing expenses. Thus, while unit sales growth positively contributed to international sales, it was insufficient to maintain profitability in the segment under the rising cost structure.",

However, this supplemental information should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related GAAP measures. Non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may differ from similar measures used by other companies.\n\nReturn on Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is meaningful for investors and management because it measures how effectively we deploy our capital base. We define ROIC as NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, for the most recent twelve-month period, divided by average debt and equity. We define average debt and equity as the average of beginning and ending long-term debt (including current installments) and equity for the most recent twelve-month period.\n\nThe following table presents the calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of NOPAT to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP measure):\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe reported net sales of $151.2 billion in fiscal 2021. Net earnings were $16.4 billion, or $15.53 per diluted share. We opened five new stores in the U.S. and two new stores in Mexico during fiscal 2021, resulting in a total store count of 2,317 at January 30, 2022, which includes 14 stores in the U.S. from a small acquisition completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. At the end of fiscal 2021, a total of 311 of our stores, or 13.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $604.74 in fiscal 2021. Our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2020. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment.\n\nWe generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt during fiscal 2021. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $14.8 billion for share repurchases, pay $7.0 billion of dividends, fund $2.6 billion in capital expenditures, and repay an aggregate of $1.5 billion of long-term debt. In February 2022, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.90 per share.\n\nOur ROIC was 44.7% for fiscal 2021 and 40.8% for fiscal 2020. See the 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure).",

      "question": "How does GM's decline in GMNA fleet sales volume from 2023 to 2024 compare with the corresponding change in GMNA's net sales and revenue during the same period, and what might this indicate about pricing or product mix trends?",
      "answer": "GMNA's fleet sales volume decreased from 679,000 units in 2023 to 615,000 units in 2024, a decline of 64,000 units or 9.4%. However, GMNA's net sales and revenue increased from $127,472 million in 2023 to $128,378 million in 2024, indicating a slight increase of $906 million. This suggests that despite a drop in fleet sales volume, GMNA was able to maintain or slightly increase revenue, potentially due to higher pricing, a shift toward higher-margin vehicles, or improved fleet pricing strategies.",

      "question": "How do Starbucks' increased investments in partner wages and benefits across both company-operated stores and corporate functions impact store operating expenses as a percentage of revenue, and what does this suggest about the company's strategic trade-off between labor cost pressures and operational efficiency gains?",
      "answer": "Starbucks reported that store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased by 140 basis points in fiscal 2024, with approximately 170 basis points of that increase attributed to investments in store partner wages and benefits. Meanwhile, within corporate and other unallocated expenses, the company also invested an additional $57 million in partner wages and benefits. Despite these increased labor costs, the company noted in-store operational efficiencies offset approximately 170 basis points of the expense pressure. This indicates a strategic trade-off where Starbucks is intentionally absorbing higher labor costs to invest in workforce quality, while simultaneously pursuing efficiency initiatives to mitigate the impact on profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

Store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues increased 140 basis points, primarily due to investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 170 basis points), deleverage (approximately 80 basis points), and increased promotional activity (approximately 70 basis points), partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies (approx imately 170 basis points).\n\nOther operating expenses increased $26 million, primarily due to support costs for our growing licensed markets.\n\nDepreciation and amortization expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased 40 basis points, primarily due to deleverage.\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses increased $82 million, primarily due to incremental investments in technology ($93 million), investments in partner wages and benefits ($90 million), and certain prox y solicitation and advisory services costs incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 ($28 million).

These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($61 million) and the lapping of donations to The Starbucks Foundation made in fiscal 2023 ($30 million).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of September 29, 2024, approximately $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Borrowing Capacity\n\n## Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the '2021 credit facility'), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital ex penditures, and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\n\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's rating agencies. The 'Base Rate' is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\n\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of September 29, 2024, or October 1, 2023.",

      "answer": "GMI's revenue increased from $15,420 million in 2022 to $15,949 million in 2023, reflecting a modest $529 million growth. However, the volume variance for GMI during this period was -$0.6 billion, indicating a decline in sales volume. This suggests that the revenue growth was not driven by increased volume but rather by other factors such as pricing or mix improvements. Therefore, GMI's revenue growth was primarily supported by higher pricing or product mix rather than an increase in unit sales.",

      "answer": "Starbucks' consolidated financial statements disclose that the China reporting unit, part of the International segment, had a goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million as of September 29, 2024, and remained unimpaired despite macroeconomic risks (page 92). Meanwhile, the Channel Development segment maintained a consistent goodwill balance of $34.7 million across all three fiscal years presented (page 78). This fixed allocation suggests that Starbucks views the Channel Development segment as a stable, lower-risk growth channel that is not subject to the same volatility as the China market. The lack of change in goodwill for this segment may indicate a consistent strategic positioning and limited need for impairment testing, contrasting with the more dynamic and risk-exposed China reporting unit.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "The increase in wage-related expenses directly contributed to a 17% increase in the loss before interest and taxes for the Global Brand Divisions in fiscal 2022, as these divisions primarily represent demand creation and operating overhead costs rather than revenue-generating activities. Despite this, the Global Brand Divisions only contributed $102 million in total revenues, as shown in the geographic revenue breakdown, highlighting the cost-center nature of these operations. This indicates that while the Global Brand Divisions are essential for supporting brand-wide initiatives such as digital capabilities and product design, they do not directly contribute to top-line growth and instead place upward pressure on expenses.",

NIKE Direct revenues increased 15%, primarily due to comparable store sales growth of 30% due to improved physical retail traffic, in part resulting from temporary store closures and safety-related measures in response to COVID-19 in the prior year, as well as digital sales growth of 8%.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues increased 9%, driven by higher revenues in the Jordan Brand and Men's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 1%, while higher ASP per pair contributed approximately 10 percentage points of footwear revenue growth. Higher ASP per pair was primarily due to higher NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs as well as a higher mix of full-price sales.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues increased 16% due primarily to higher revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel increased 9%, while higher ASP per unit contributed approximately 7 percentage points of apparel revenue growth, primarily due to higher full-price and NIKE Direct ASPs.\n\nReported EBIT increased 35% as gross margin expansion and higher revenues more than offset higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin increased approximately 570 basis points primarily due to higher NIKE Direct margins, favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates, a higher mix of full-price sales and higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, partially offset by higher product costs. Higher full-price ASP, net of discounts, was largely due to strategic pricing actions, while higher product costs were primarily due to increased freight and logistics costs. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Higher demand creation expense was driven by higher advertising and marketing expense. Higher operating overhead expense was primarily due to increases in wage-related expenses and professional services.\n\n2022 FORM 10-K 38",

      "answer": "GM recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its investment in SAIC-GMAC due to market challenges in China, which directly impacted GM Financial. GM Financial, in turn, includes 'provision for loan losses' as a key expense item, indicating its role in managing credit risk exposure. This provision is used to recognize expected loan losses over the life of finance receivables, suggesting that GM Financial must account for potential downstream effects from weakened international operations. The impairment charge and the provision for loan losses together highlight how GM's international performance pressures flow through to its captive finance subsidiary, requiring increased reserves and signaling broader financial interdependencies.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "Starbucks' International Segment experienced a revenue decline driven by unfavorable foreign currency translation impacts of $235 million and lower licensee sales, as reported on page 39. Despite this, the International segment's goodwill balance increased from $2,691.1 million in fiscal 2023 to $2,788.5 million in fiscal 2024, as shown in the goodwill table on page 78. On page 92, the auditor confirms that the China reporting unit, which is part of the International segment, had a fair value greater than its carrying value, supporting the lack of impairment. This suggests that despite short-term revenue pressures, the long-term strategic value of the International segment, particularly in China, remains strong enough to justify the increased goodwill balance.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "GM relies on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services to customers and dealers, which directly supports vehicle sales and market penetration. GM Financial's ability to offer competitive financing is affected by the depreciation rate of its leased vehicles, which is influenced by residual value estimates. In 2021, due to high used vehicle prices, GM Financial increased its residual value estimates, resulting in a prospective decrease in depreciation rates over the remaining lease terms. However, if used vehicle prices weaken, GM Financial may increase depreciation expense or record impairment charges on the lease portfolio. These impairment charges, as disclosed in GM's consolidated financial statements, would be recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses, directly impacting GM's financial performance. Therefore, the interplay between GM Financial's residual value assumptions, depreciation rates, and potential impairments introduces financial and operational risk that could affect GM's broader asset valuation and impairment disclosures.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Realization  of  the  residual  values  is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is evaluated over the life of the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes. Adjustments may be in the form of revisions to the depreciation rate or recognition of an impairment charge. A lease vehicle asset group is determined to be impaired if an impairment indicator exists and the expected future cash flows, which include estimated residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the vehicle asset group. If the carrying amount is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the vehicle asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows, including estimated residual values. In our automotive finance operations when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed the asset is recorded in Other assets at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for any difference between the net book value of the leased asset and the proceeds from the disposition of the asset.\n\nEquity  Investments When  events  and  circumstances  warrant,  equity  investments  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of accounting are evaluated for impairment. An impairment charge is recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other-than-temporary. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are recorded in Equity income. Equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value or in  certain  cases  adjusted  to  fair  value  upon  an  observable  price  change,  with  changes  in  fair  value  recorded  in  Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\nProperty, net Property, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend the useful life or add functionality are capitalized. The gross amount of assets under finance leases is included in property, plant and equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate depreciable property using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The amortization of the assets under finance leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of property, plant  and  equipment,  the  cost  and  related  accumulated  depreciation  are  eliminated  and  any  resulting  gain  or  loss  is  recorded  in earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales, Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nSpecial Tools Special tools represent product-specific propulsion and non-propulsion related tools, dies, molds and other items used in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize special tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method or an accelerated amortization method based on their historical and estimated production volume. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nGoodwill Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually on October 1 and when events warrant such a review. The impairment test entails an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.\n\nIntangible Assets, net Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, primarily include brand names, technology and intellectual property, customer  relationships  and  dealer  networks.  Intangible  assets  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  or  an  accelerated  method  of amortization over their estimated useful lives. An accelerated amortization method reflecting the pattern in which the asset will be consumed is utilized if that pattern can be reliably determined. We consider the period of expected cash flows and underlying data used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  the  intangible  assets  when  selecting  a  useful  life. Amortization  of  developed  technology  and intellectual property is recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and our dealer networks is recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Impairment charges, if any, related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Product-specific long-lived asset groups and non-product specific long-lived assets are separately tested for impairment on an asset group basis. Fair value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated",

Unallocated corporate expenses include corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments.\n\nCorporate and Other operating loss increased to $1.9 billion for fiscal 2024, or 5%, compared to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2023. This increase was primarily driven by incremental investments in technology ($93 million), investments in partner wages and benefits ($57 million), and certain proxy solicitation and advisory services costs incurred in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 ($28 million). These increases were partially offset by lower performance-based compensation ($61 million) and the lapping of donations to The Starbucks Foundation made in fiscal 2023 ($30 million).\n\n## FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n\n## Cash and Investment Overview\n\nOur cash and investments were $3.8 billion and $4.2 billion as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, respectively. We actively manage our cash and investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, fund acquisitions, and return cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments and share repurchases. Our investment portfolio primarily includes highly liquid available-for-sale securities, including corporate debt securities, government treasury securities (domestic and foreign), and commercial paper as well as principal-protected structured deposits. As of September 29, 2024, approximately $2.1 billion of cash and short-term investments were held in foreign subsidiaries.\n\n## Borrowing Capacity\n\n## Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper\n\n## Revolving Credit Facility\n\nOur $3.0 billion unsecured five-year revolving credit facility (the '2021 credit facility'), of which $150.0 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit, is currently set to mature on September 16, 2026. The 2021 credit facility is available for working capital, capital ex penditures, and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We have the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $1.0 billion.\n\nBorrowings under the 2021 credit facility, which was most recently amended in April 2023, will bear interest at a variable rate based on Term SOFR, and, for U.S. dollar-denominated loans under certain circumstances, a Base Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility), in each case plus an applicable margin. The applicable margin is based on the Company's long-term credit ratings assigned by the Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's rating agencies. The 'Base Rate' is the highest of (i) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the 2021 credit facility) plus 0.500%, (ii) Bank of America's prime rate, and (iii) Term SOFR plus 1.000%. Term SOFR means the forward-looking SOFR term rate administrated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange plus a SOFR Adjustment of 0.100%.\n\nThe 2021 credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. As of September 29, 2024, we were in compliance with all applicable covenants. No amounts were outstanding under our 2021 credit facility as of September 29, 2024, or October 1, 2023.",

See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

      "answer": "GM made a strategic investment of $1.0 billion in Cruise in 2021, as part of a broader $2.7 billion funding round aimed at accelerating the development and commercialization of autonomous vehicles (AVs). Cruise, in turn, relies on a multi-year credit agreement with GM Financial for up to $5.2 billion to fund the exclusive purchase of AVs from GM. However, the GM Financial section highlights significant risks related to its ability to provide financing, including access to capital, performance of loan portfolios, and residual value volatility due to fluctuating used vehicle prices. These risks suggest that GM Financial\u2019s capacity to support Cruise\u2019s AV purchases could be constrained under economic stress, which would directly impact Cruise\u2019s ability to scale its operations and fulfill GM\u2019s strategic vision for autonomous mobility.

U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021.

Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.

Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does Nike's categorization of 'Miscellaneous Revenues' within the Global Brand Divisions reconcile with the $102 million in 'Other' revenues reported in the geographic segment disclosures, and what does this imply about the company's centralized revenue streams?",
      "answer": "Nike's Global Brand Divisions include revenues from licensing and other miscellaneous sources that are not part of geographic operating segments, as noted in the discussion on page 37. This aligns with the $102 million in 'Other' revenues listed under the Global Brand Divisions column in the geographic segment table on page 88. The fact that these revenues are separately categorized outside of geographic performance metrics suggests that Nike manages certain revenue streams centrally, likely to reflect corporate-level activities or non-operational income such as licensing or digital operations. This distinction implies that Nike evaluates geographic performance excluding these centralized revenue contributions.",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial for automotive financing expose the company to risks associated with residual value estimates, given the $29.1 billion estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles and GM's disclosure of $1.3 billion in residual value-related activity in 2020?",
      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services to customers and dealers, which directly supports vehicle sales and market penetration. GM Financial's ability to offer competitive leasing terms is influenced by its residual value estimates on leased vehicles, which totaled $29.1 billion at the end of 2021. These estimates are based on market assumptions such as used vehicle prices and auction values. If actual used vehicle prices fall below these estimates, GM Financial would face higher depreciation expenses or impairment charges, which could reduce its profitability and constrain its financial flexibility. This, in turn, could limit GM Financial\u2019s ability to support GM\u2019s sales through favorable leasing programs. Furthermore, GM disclosed that in 2020, $1.3 billion of activity was tied to residual value estimates, indicating a material financial exposure. Thus, GM\u2019s business strategy is closely tied to the accuracy and performance of these residual value assumptions, which are subject to market volatility and could materially affect both GM Financial and GM\u2019s automotive operations.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "GMNA's revenue increased from $128.378 billion in 2022 to $141.445 billion in 2023, representing a $13.067 billion growth. Of this increase, $0.7 billion is attributed to mix variance, indicating that the segment's revenue growth was only marginally influenced by changes in product or customer mix. This suggests that the majority of the growth was volume-driven ($8.5 billion) and price-driven ($3.2 billion), with mix playing a relatively minor role. The low impact of mix variance implies that GMNA's product or customer composition remained largely stable year-over-year, despite significant overall revenue growth.",

      "question": "Given that Global Brand Divisions reported a loss before interest and taxes that decreased by 2% in fiscal 2024, primarily due to lower operating overhead but higher demand creation expense, how does this trend reconcile with the $4,285 million total demand creation expense reported in the footnotes, and what does this reveal about Nike's strategic allocation of marketing investments across its global brand divisions?",
      "answer": "Nike's Global Brand Divisions experienced a 2% decrease in loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2024, driven by lower operating overhead costs, but this was partially offset by an increase in demand creation expense. The footnotes disclose that total demand creation expense for fiscal 2024 was $4,285 million, up from $4,060 million in fiscal 2023. This indicates that despite cost-cutting in other areas, Nike increased its investment in marketing and brand promotion. The strategic emphasis on demand creation\u2014driven by advertising, endorsements, and digital marketing\u2014suggests Nike is prioritizing brand strength and consumer engagement as a lever for future revenue growth, even as it reduces other overhead costs.",

Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net R evenues is recorded in the period in which such determ ination is m ade.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales consists prim arily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in C ost of sales.\n\n## DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE\n\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and prom otion costs, including costs of endorsem ent contracts, com plim entary products, television, digital and print advertising as well as m edia costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first tim e an advertisem ent is run. Advertising m edia costs are expensed when the advertisem ent appears. C osts related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. C osts related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is com plete and delivered.\n\nA significant am ount of the C om pany's prom otional expenses result from  paym ents under endorsem ent contracts. In general, endorsem ent paym ents are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term  of the contract. H owever, certain contracts contain elem ents that m ay be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circum stances of each individual contract. P repaym ents m ade under contracts are included in P repaid expenses and other current assets or D eferred incom e taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applies.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent paym ents to endorsers based upon specific achievem ents in their sport (e.g., winning a cham pionship). T he C om pany records D em and creation expense for these am ounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable paym ents based upon endorsers m aintaining a level of perform ance in their sport over an extended period of tim e (e.g., m aintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). W hen the C om pany determ ines paym ents are probable, the am ounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the C om pany's best estim ate of the endorser's perform ance.

      "question": "How does GM's disclosure about the delinquency risk in GM Financial's retail finance receivables with $602 million in suspended finance charge income at the end of 2021 relate to the interest rate sensitivity of GM Financial's portfolio and the broader risk GM faces if GM Financial's ability to provide competitive financing is impaired?",
      "answer": "GM Financial's retail finance receivables, which are a core part of its automotive financing business, had $602 million in suspended finance charge income at the end of 2021 due to delinquencies. This highlights credit risk and potential income loss from non-performing assets. GM Financial's interest rate risk profile further complicates this, as it was liability-sensitive in 2021, meaning rising interest rates would initially reduce net interest income. This sensitivity could exacerbate the financial impact of delinquencies, reducing GM Financial's profitability and capital availability. GM, in turn, depends on GM Financial to provide competitive financing to customers and dealers, and any reduction in this capability\u2014whether from delinquencies or interest rate pressures\u2014could impair GM's ability to support vehicle sales and expand market penetration, as explicitly stated in the risk factors section.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks related to our operations\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability  of  affordable  financing,  elevated  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or uncertainty, the occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons, including a moderate to severe recession in any of the markets in which we operate, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials, energy or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, elevated cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials for our EV  propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EV s and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. G eopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic, regulatory and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials, energy and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of  the  largest  global  manufacturers  and  numerous  domestic  manufacturers,  which  have  ex perienced  significant  growth  in  customer  acceptance,  as  well  as  nontraditional  market  participants,  such  as  domestic  technology  companies.  Over  the  last  several  years,  this  intense  competition  and  an  increasingly  challenging operating environment negatively impacted the profitability of our operations in China, our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. As a result, in December 2024, our Board of Directors determined there to be a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JV s. Updated business forecasts and recent restructuring actions to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions have indicated that the loss in value is other-than-temporary for our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), certain SGM subsidiaries and SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC). As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024. We also recorded additional equity losses of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of these restructuring actions, which includes plant closures and portfolio optimization, in the year ended December 31, 2024. These charges are non-cash in nature. We expect SGM will likely incur additional restructuring charges in 2025. We cannot guarantee that the restructuring actions will be successful in our China JV s achieving long-term profitability or that additional, material restructuring actions will not be required.\n\nIn addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EV s, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies while achieving affordability. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China and the unique regulatory landscape in China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions, weakening economic conditions in China or China's level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.",

However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion.

If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1)  the  sum  of  remaining  lease  payments  plus  estimated  residual  value;  over  (2)  leased  vehicles,  net  less  deferred  revenue.

SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial to fund Cruise's AV purchases align with the risks GM highlights about GM Financial's access to capital, especially in light of Cruise's $5.2 billion borrowing arrangement and GM's strategic investment in Cruise's self-driving ambitions?",
      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide up to $5.2 billion in financing to Cruise specifically for the purchase of autonomous vehicles (AVs), which directly supports Cruise's strategic mission to commercialize self-driving services. However, GM acknowledges in its risk factors that GM Financial faces significant risks related to access to capital, including the availability and cost of financing sources such as securitization programs and debt issuances. If GM Financial were to face disruptions in its access to capital markets or experience increased borrowing costs, it could impair its ability to fund Cruise\u2019s AV purchases, thereby delaying Cruise\u2019s commercialization timeline. This risk is particularly relevant given that GM has already made a $1.0 billion strategic investment in Cruise, underscoring the importance of GM Financial\u2019s continued financial health to the success of GM's broader autonomous vehicle strategy.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\n\nGMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

      "answer": "The International segment experienced a $69 million decline in revenue from licensees, which signals weakening performance in this region. This decline could indicate reduced future cash flow expectations, potentially affecting the impairment or valuation of goodwill tied to the segment. Between fiscal years 2022 and 2023, the goodwill balance for the International segment decreased from $2,756.7 million to $2,691.1 million, a reduction of $65.6 million. This reduction aligns with the 'Other (1)' line item showing a $65.6 million decrease in goodwill for the International segment.

      "answer": "GM reported an increase in near-prime FICO score 620 to 679 retail finance receivables from $7,935 million in 2020 to $8,479 million in 2021, indicating a growing share of this credit segment in their financing portfolio. At the same time, fleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales declined from 12.4% in 2020 to 11.3% in 2021, suggesting a relative shift away from fleet toward retail sales. This alignment reflects a strategic emphasis on expanding retail financing, particularly among near-prime borrowers, as fleet sales decreased proportionally.",

      "answer": "The Channel Development segment maintained a consistent $34.7 million goodwill balance from 2022 through 2024, indicating no impairment or reallocation occurred for this segment during the period. Meanwhile, the auditor's report highlights a specific focus on the China reporting unit within the International segment, which carried $2,788.5 million of the total $3,315.7 million goodwill balance as of September 29, 2024. Although the fair value of the China unit exceeded its carrying value, avoiding an impairment charge, the auditor emphasized the complexity and subjectivity involved in these valuations. This contrast reveals that while the Channel Development segment's goodwill remains stable and unproblematic, the majority of goodwill risk and audit scrutiny is concentrated in the International segment, particularly China, due to its scale and exposure to market and economic assumptions.",

      "question": "How does GM's strategic investment of $1.0 billion in Cruise, which is dependent on a $5.2 billion credit agreement with GM Financial, reconcile with the acknowledged risks to GM Financial's ability to provide financing services due to potential disruptions in capital availability?",
      "answer": "GM's strategic investment of $1.0 billion in Cruise (page_33) underscores its commitment to advancing autonomous vehicle (AV) technology. However, Cruise's operations are partially dependent on a multi-year credit agreement with GM Financial, allowing up to $5.2 billion in borrowings (page_43) exclusively for purchasing AVs from GM. This financial linkage creates a dependency where Cruise\u2019s growth and development of AVs hinge on GM Financial\u2019s capacity to fund the agreement. Meanwhile, GM Financial faces risks related to capital availability and financing costs (page_24), which could impair its ability to support not only customer and dealer financing but also internal obligations like the Cruise credit line. Therefore, while GM is doubling down on its AV ambitions through Cruise, the viability of this strategy is contingent on GM Financial maintaining stable access to capital markets, which is not guaranteed given the acknowledged financial and regulatory risks.",

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\n\nGMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

These residual values are critical to GM Financial\u2019s operations, as they underpin the depreciation schedules and financial performance of its leasing portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial could face increased depreciation expense or impairment charges, which would negatively affect its financial health.

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "GM reported an allowance for loan losses of 2.7% of finance receivables at the end of 2023, consistent with the prior year. On page 73, the data shows that 12.8% of the retail finance receivables portfolio, totaling $8,392 million, is categorized as near-prime (FICO score 620 to 679). This segment falls between prime and sub-prime borrowers, suggesting moderate credit risk. The fact that the allowance for loan losses remains steady at 2.7% despite the presence of a notable near-prime exposure implies that GM may view this segment as relatively stable or manageable within its overall credit risk framework.

      "answer": "GM reports dealer financing balances of $13.3 billion at December 31, 2023, indicating significant exposure to commercial finance receivables tied to its dealers. GM Financial, which manages these receivables, uses static pool modeling and economic forecasts\u2014such as unemployment rates and GDP growth\u2014to estimate its allowance for loan losses. However, the aging table shows that 2.9% of retail finance receivables were either more than 30 days delinquent or in repossession at year-end, suggesting actual credit performance challenges. This implies that while GM Financial's allowance methodology incorporates forward-looking economic indicators, the current delinquency levels highlight potential gaps between forecasted and realized losses, especially as dealer financing remains a large portion of its portfolio.",

      "answer": "GM evaluates its Automotive Segment using EBIT-adjusted, a non-GAAP metric that excludes certain non-core expenses such as advertising, which is listed as a key component of segment expenses. While advertising is a material cost category within the Automotive Segment's operating expenses, it is also a discretionary and strategic investment that can be adjusted based on market conditions and corporate priorities. This dual treatment suggests that while advertising is integral to segment performance, its variable nature allows GM to manage it separately when assessing core operational profitability through EBIT-adjusted.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "The reduction in technology spending directly contributed to a decrease in operating overhead expenses for the Global Brand Divisions, which led to a 2% decrease in their loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2024. This cost-saving measure was a key factor in improving the segment's operating performance despite higher demand creation expenses. Although the Global Brand Divisions reported only $102 million in revenues in fiscal 2024 (primarily from licensing and other miscellaneous revenue streams), their cost structure includes centrally managed digital operations and enterprise technology for the broader NIKE Brand. The reduction in technology spend helped offset the increased advertising and marketing costs, highlighting a strategic focus on managing overhead while maintaining investment in demand creation.",

      "question": "How does GM's inclusion of equity income in Automotive segment expenses align with its EBIT-adjusted metric that excludes automotive interest income when evaluating the true profitability of its core automotive operations?",
      "answer": "On page 104, GM explicitly states that equity income is a component of Automotive segment expenses, indicating that joint venture earnings directly impact segment-level financials. This inclusion suggests that equity income is considered integral to the Automotive segment's operational performance. However, on page 46, GM defines EBIT-adjusted as excluding automotive interest income and expense, framing these as non-core items not reflective of operational performance. This creates a tension: while equity income (which may include interest-related components) is embedded in segment-level results, it is later stripped out in a key corporate profitability metric. This dual treatment implies that GM views equity income as operationally relevant at the segment level but strategically separable at the consolidated performance evaluation stage, which could affect how analysts assess the sustainability and quality of the company's automotive earnings.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "Starbucks reported a goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million for the International segment as of September 29, 2024, with no impairment charge recorded for the China reporting unit, indicating that its fair value exceeded carrying value during the annual assessment. However, the International segment also experienced negative revenue impacts during the year, including a $69 million decline in licensed store revenue driven by lower product and royalty revenues. This contrast suggests that while the segment's long-term cash flow projections and market multiples used in the goodwill impairment analysis supported no impairment, the actual financial performance of the segment showed signs of pressure, particularly in licensing, which could raise questions about the assumptions used in the valuation models and the forward-looking sustainability of the segment's fair value.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "GM reports that as of December 31, 2020, 3.0% of retail finance receivables were more than 30 days delinquent or in repossession, totaling $1,548 million. GM Financial, which manages these receivables, uses static pool modeling techniques supplemented by management judgment to determine the allowance for loan losses, incorporating forecasts of economic conditions such as unemployment rates and interest rate spreads. However, GM acknowledges that any reduction in GM Financial\u2019s ability to provide leasing and financing\u2014due to risks such as access to capital, interest rate fluctuations, or delinquency performance\u2014would negatively affect GM's ability to support vehicle sales and expand market penetration.

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "The reduction in wage-related expenses within the Global Brand Divisions contributed to a 2% decrease in the segment's loss before interest and taxes, primarily due to lower operating overhead costs. This cost-saving measure also had a direct positive impact on Nike's Corporate segment, where a favorable change of $80 million was attributed to lower wage-related expenses. This alignment reveals that cost reductions implemented at the Global Brand Division level, such as decreased wage-related spending, flowed into broader corporate financial improvements, even as other corporate expenses (like restructuring charges) offset some of these gains. The evidence shows that strategic cost management at the segment level was partially reflected in the corporate financial results, indicating a coordinated approach to expense control.",

Our prim ary foreign currency exposures arise from  the recording of transactions denom inated in non-functional currencies and the translation of foreign currency denom inated results of operations, financial position and cash flows into U .S. D ollars.\n\nOur foreign exchange risk m anagem ent program  is intended to lessen both the positive and negative effects of currency fluctuations on our consolidated results of operations, financial position and cash flows. W e m anage global foreign exchange risk centrally on a portfolio basis to address those risks m aterial to N IKE , Inc. W e m anage these exposures by taking advantage of natural offsets and currency correlations existing within the portfolio and, where practical and m aterial, by hedging a portion of the rem aining exposures using derivative instrum ents such as forward contracts and options. As described below, the im plem entation of the N IKE  T rading C om pany (\"N T C \") and our foreign currency adjustm ent program  enhanced our ability to m anage our foreign exchange risk by increasing the natural offsets and currency correlation benefits existing within our portfolio of foreign exchange exposures. Our hedging policy is designed to partially or entirely offset the im pact of exchange rate changes on the underlying net exposures being hedged. W here exposures are hedged, our program  has the effect of delaying the im pact of exchange rate m ovem ents on our C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents; the length of the delay is dependent upon hedge horizons. We do not hold or issue derivative instrum ents for trading or speculative purposes.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 44",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial for commercial lending align with the concentration risk in GM Financial's commercial finance receivables portfolio as of December 31, 2020, particularly given that $6,968 million of receivables originated in 2020 and represent 90.5% of the total portfolio?",
      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide commercial lending to dealers, which is critical for supporting vehicle sales and market penetration. GM Financial's commercial finance receivables portfolio, as of December 31, 2020, was heavily concentrated in receivables originated in 2020, amounting to $6,968 million or 90.5% of the total portfolio. This high concentration in a single origination year suggests a significant exposure to the credit quality and performance of that specific cohort. If economic or operational conditions deteriorate for dealers originating in that year, GM Financial could face higher delinquencies or charge-offs, which would impair its ability to fund future lending and, in turn, negatively affect GM's vehicle sales strategy. This aligns with GM's risk disclosure that GM Financial\u2019s ability to provide financing services is sensitive to factors such as delinquencies, charge-offs, and the overall performance of its loan portfolio.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\n\n",

      "answer": "Nike's Global Brand Divisions are described as capturing revenues from licensing and other miscellaneous sources not aligned with geographic operating segments or standard product categories like footwear, apparel, or equipment. This qualitative characterization aligns with the $102 million 'Other' revenue line item reported under Global Brand Divisions in the revenue breakdown by product category. The 'Other' classification in the quantitative section reflects non-core product revenues, which correspond to the definition provided in the earlier section that emphasizes the non-geographic, non-core nature of these revenues. This reconciliation shows that Nike systematically accounts for and isolates revenue streams that do not fit within their primary business segments into the 'Other' category under Global Brand Divisions.",

      "question": "Given the minimal goodwill allocation to the Corporate and Other segment despite its role in supporting international operations, how does Starbucks' goodwill impairment assessment for the China reporting unit reinforce or conflict with the strategic importance attributed to this segment in the consolidated financial reporting?",
      "answer": "Starbucks allocated only $1.0 million of goodwill to the Corporate and Other segment as of September 29, 2024, despite its role in supporting international operations (page 78). Meanwhile, the China reporting unit, part of the International segment, held $2,788.5 million in goodwill and was assessed for impairment using income and market approaches, with management concluding that its fair value exceeded carrying value, so no impairment was recorded (page 92). This suggests that while the Corporate and Other segment is functionally important, the majority of goodwill is tied directly to revenue-generating international units like China, aligning valuation risk with operational performance rather than corporate infrastructure.",

        "Hop 1: SBUX(page_92) \u2192 Goodwill Balance: The auditor's report confirms no goodwill impairment for the China reporting unit, which had a goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million as of September 29, 2024.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

In 2022, the mix of airline ticket gross bookings also increased, contributing to a decline in the metric from 14.3% in 2021 to 14.1% in 2022.

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "question": "Given GMNA's 14.6% increase in net sales and revenue from 2023 to 2024 alongside a 9.4% decrease in fleet sales volume, what does this imply about the segment's pricing or product mix strategy?",
      "answer": "The 14.6% increase in GMNA's net sales and revenue\u2014from $127,472 million in 2023 to $140,536 million in 2024\u2014contrasts with a 9.4% decrease in fleet sales volume\u2014from 679,000 units in 2023 to 615,000 units in 2024. This divergence implies that GMNA likely achieved higher average selling prices or shifted toward higher-margin products within its portfolio. The revenue growth outpaces unit volume changes, suggesting a strategic emphasis on premium offerings or pricing discipline rather than volume-driven sales. This aligns with a broader trend of optimizing revenue per unit, particularly in light of GM's stated focus on profitability and electrification investments.",

      "question": "How did changes in product mix contribute to GMI's revenue growth from 2022 to 2023, particularly in light of the negative volume variance, and what does this suggest about the segment's pricing power and cost management effectiveness?",
      "answer": "GMI's revenue increased from $15.42 billion in 2022 to $15.95 billion in 2023, a growth of $529 million. According to the variance analysis, this growth was driven by a $1.2 billion favorable price variance and a $0.4 billion favorable mix variance, despite a $0.6 billion unfavorable volume variance. This indicates that GMI was able to offset declining sales volume through higher pricing and a more profitable product mix.

      "answer": "GM Financial records a provision for loan losses to recognize expected credit losses over the life of its finance receivables, which is a key component of its financial performance. In 2024, GM Financial was directly impacted by the challenging market conditions in China, leading to a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its investment in SAIC-GMAC, a joint venture primarily engaged in automotive financing. This impairment was driven by the same competitive pressures and regulatory changes affecting the broader Automotive China JVs, which collectively recorded $4.4 billion in equity losses, including $2.1 billion in other-than-temporary impairments. The connection reveals that deteriorating credit conditions in China\u2019s automotive sector are not only affecting joint venture profitability but are also increasing GM Financial's credit risk exposure, as evidenced by both the impairment charge and the expected lifetime loan loss provisions. This dual impact highlights a systemic financial stress point in GM\u2019s international operations.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial for automotive financing align with the liquidity requirements that GM Financial must meet, given GM Financial's $3.5 billion dividend payout in 2021 and its dependence on competitive financing sources?",
      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services to customers and dealers, which directly supports vehicle sales and market expansion. However, GM Financial's ability to fulfill this role is contingent on its access to competitive financing sources, such as credit facilities and debt issuances, which are subject to market conditions and regulatory oversight. Despite these liquidity pressures, GM Financial paid $3.5 billion in dividends in 2021, indicating strong earnings and residual value performance. GM's overall liquidity strategy, which includes $15.5 billion in credit facilities and access to capital markets, is designed to ensure that liquidity needs are met across the company, including for GM Financial. This alignment suggests that GM maintains a coordinated liquidity framework to support both operational needs and financial services, even while distributing capital through dividends.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2021. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\n\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed  securities.  Our  investment  guidelines,  which  we  may  change  from  time  to  time,  prescribe  certain  minimum  credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the total size of our credit facilities was $18.5 billion, which consisted principally of four revolving credit facilities. In April 2021, we increased the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $10.5 billion facility to $11.2 billion and extended the termination date for a $9.9 billion portion of the five-year facility by three years, now set to mature on April 18, 2026. The termination date of April 18, 2023 for the remaining portion of the five-year facility remains unchanged. We also renewed and increased the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.0 billion facility to $4.3 billion, which now matures on April 7, 2024, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use by GM Financial, which now matures on April 6, 2022. We also terminated a separate 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into in May 2020. Additionally, the prior restrictions on share repurchases and dividends on our common shares were removed upon entrance into the renewed three-year, $4.3 billion facility. In December 2021, we terminated our three-year, $2.0 billion transformation credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the total size of our credit facilities was $15.5 billion, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities.\n\nIf available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2021 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.\n\nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $3.5 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.4 billion on its common stock in  2021,  2020,  and  2019.  Current  dividend  levels  are  reflective  of  GM  Financial  earnings  supported  by  strong  residual  values, favorable  credit  performance  and  improved  economic  conditions.  Future  dividends  from  GM  Financial  will  depend  on  several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial for customer and dealer financing align with the reported $1.839 billion allowance for loan losses on retail receivables, given GM Financial's sensitivity to forecast recovery rate changes and economic conditions?",
      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services to customers and commercial lending to dealers, which is critical to supporting vehicle sales and market penetration. GM Financial's ability to offer these services is impacted by its allowance for loan losses, which stood at $1.839 billion for retail receivables as of December 31, 2021. This allowance reflects forecasted credit losses over the next two years and is sensitive to GM Financial's assumptions about recovery rates\u2014each 5% decrease in recovery rates would increase the allowance by $0.1 billion. The reported allowance, which is netted against $58.093 billion in retail receivables, indicates a material financial exposure that could grow under adverse economic conditions. Therefore, while GM depends on GM Financial to drive sales, the size and sensitivity of the allowance for loan losses highlight the financial risk GM assumes through this dependency, especially if economic conditions deteriorate.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

      "question": "Given the 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2022, how does the growth in selling and administrative expenses\u2014specifically the $14,804 million total reported in fiscal 2022\u2014reflect the strategic investments and demand creation costs outlined in the Global Brand Divisions' operating model?",
      "answer": "The 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2022 was driven by a significant rise in selling and administrative expenses, which reached $14,804 million. This expense growth was primarily attributed to higher operating overhead, including strategic technology investments, digital capabilities expansion, and wage-related costs, as well as increased demand creation expenses such as advertising and sports marketing. These investments align with the Global Brand Divisions' role in managing centrally driven brand initiatives, digital infrastructure, and product creation, despite not contributing directly to geographic segment revenues. The elevated costs reflect a deliberate strategic shift to strengthen global brand positioning and digital engagement, even at the expense of short-term profitability.",

      "question": "How does GM's exposure to used vehicle price volatility, as outlined in the valuation of GM Financial's leased assets, reconcile with GM Financial's reported dealer financing balances and their strategic reliance on automotive financing to support vehicle sales?",
      "answer": "GM's exposure to used vehicle price volatility directly affects GM Financial's leased asset valuations, where a weakening in used vehicle prices could increase depreciation expense or require impairment charges on the $22.7 billion estimated residual value of leased vehicles. This sensitivity is outlined in the valuation methodology that GM Financial uses to manage residual risk, which is a core component of its leasing program. GM Financial's leasing penetration was 42% of U.S. retail sales in 2023, and gains on lease terminations declined to $0.9 billion in 2023 from $1.2 billion in 2022, partly due to higher net book values at termination. Meanwhile, GM Financial's dealer financing balances stood at $13.3 billion at the end of 2023, showing a growing dependence on commercial financing to support dealership operations. This creates a dual exposure: GM Financial must manage both residual risk on consumer leases and credit risk on dealer financing, which together support the broader automotive sales strategy. The interplay suggests that volatility in used vehicle prices could simultaneously impact consumer lease residuals and dealer liquidity, thereby affecting GM's broader automotive sales and financial services profitability.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM(page_45) \u2192 Used Vehicle Prices: GM Financial estimates residual values of leased vehicles based on used vehicle prices, third-party data, and market conditions. A weakening in used vehicle prices could trigger increased depreciation or impairment charges on the $22.7 billion estimated residual value of leased vehicles.",
        "Hop 2: Used Vehicle Prices \u2192 GM Financial: GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual value risk, which is directly tied to used vehicle prices. In 2023, gains on lease terminations decreased to $0.9 billion from $1.2 billion in 2022, partly due to higher net book values at termination, indicating sensitivity to market pricing trends.",
        "Hop 3: GM Financial \u2190 GM(page_72): GM Financial's dealer financing balances increased to $13.3 billion in 2023, reflecting its strategic role in supporting dealership operations and GM's vehicle sales. This exposure, combined with residual risk from consumer leases, highlights GM Financial's dual financial services role in supporting both consumers and dealers."

      "question": "How did the $529 million increase in GMI's net sales from 2022 to 2023 compare to its fleet sales volume growth, and what does this suggest about GMI's pricing power and market positioning in the automotive segment, given the $1.2 billion price variance contribution and negative $600 million volume variance?",
      "answer": "GMI's net sales increased by $529 million from 2022 to 2023, driven primarily by a $1.2 billion positive price variance, despite a negative $600 million volume variance. This indicates that GMI's revenue growth was not due to increased sales volume but rather to higher pricing. At the same time, GMI's fleet sales volume grew from 426,000 units in 2022 to 506,000 units in 2023, representing a 18.7% increase. However, this volume growth was not the primary revenue driver. Instead, the significant price variance suggests that GMI leveraged pricing power in its market positioning, potentially through premium offerings or strategic pricing adjustments, even as it expanded its fleet presence. This dual dynamic implies a deliberate shift toward enhancing profitability per unit rather than prioritizing volume growth.",

      "answer": "The $4.9 billion increase in collections and recoveries on finance receivables in 2021 directly improved GM Financial\u2019s liquidity, as collections are a primary source of cash for the segment, alongside proceeds from leased vehicle terminations and secured borrowings. This cash inflow supports GM Financial\u2019s ability to fund new finance receivables, manage credit enhancement requirements, and service debt. However, GM's risk disclosures highlight that GM Financial\u2019s ability to provide automotive financing is dependent on the performance of its loan and lease portfolio, which is sensitive to charge-offs, delinquencies, and access to securitization markets. Thus, while the increase in collections bolsters short-term liquidity, GM remains exposed to broader systemic risks in GM Financial\u2019s operations that could disrupt its access to capital and, in turn, GM\u2019s vehicle financing support and market penetration strategy.",

Risk Factors, banks will no longer be persuaded or compelled to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. GM Financial established a LIBOR transition initiative in 2019 to evaluate the potential impacts of the transition, and continues to implement strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the LIBOR discontinuation such as including fallback language into any new LIBOR based contracts. GM Financial has only a limited amount of debt outstanding that  is  scheduled  to  mature  after  June  30,  2023  and  would  utilize  the Alternative  Reference  Rates  Committee  fallback  process. Furthermore, GM Financial has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's Fallbacks Protocol and plans to transition its existing LIBOR-based derivative exposure in advance of the June 30, 2023 date when applicable LIBOR will no longer be published. For any residual exposure after the end of 2021, GM Financial expects to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions to transition such exposure.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the  use  of  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods  presented.  We  believe  the  accounting  estimates  employed  are  appropriate  and  the  resulting  balances  are  reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments  to  these  balances  in  future  periods.  Refer  to  Note  2  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  our  significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.\n\nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.",

      "question": "Given the significant contribution of Automotive Regulatory Credits to total automotive revenues, how does Tesla's reliance on these credits compare with the overall performance and strategic emphasis of the Automotive Segment as detailed in the segment reporting?",
      "answer": "Tesla's Automotive Regulatory Credits contributed $1,790 million to total automotive revenues of $82,419 million in 2023, representing approximately 2.2% of the segment's revenue. These credits are explicitly included as part of the Automotive Segment's revenue stream, which also encompasses vehicle sales, leasing, and services. In the segment reporting, the Automotive Segment is described as the core of Tesla's business, emphasizing electric vehicle design, manufacturing, and sales, alongside regulatory credit sales. Despite the relatively small percentage contribution from regulatory credits, their inclusion in the segment's financial performance highlights Tesla's strategic reliance on these credits as a supplementary revenue source. This aligns with Tesla's broader positioning as a leader in sustainable transportation, where regulatory incentives support both market expansion and financial flexibility.",

      "question": "How does GM's disclosure of $476 million in 'other financing' at the end of 2023 relate to the operational and financial risks GM Financial faces, particularly in light of GM's dependency on its ability to provide competitive financing services?",
      "answer": "GM disclosed $476 million in 'other financing' at the end of 2023, which includes loans to commercial vehicle upfitters and is managed by GM Financial. This financing activity is directly tied to GM Financial's broader operations, which face risks such as rising interest rates, delinquencies, and regulatory compliance. GM depends heavily on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services that support vehicle sales and dealer relationships. If GM Financial's ability to manage these risks or access capital is impaired, it could reduce its capacity to offer competitive financing, directly impacting GM's sales growth and market penetration, especially in commercial segments where $476 million in other financing plays a role.",

      "question": "How does the significant decrease in goodwill specifically within the International segment between 2021 and 2022 align with Starbucks' reliance on the licensed store model in international markets?",
      "answer": "Starbucks reported a decrease in goodwill within the International segment from $3,148.3 million in 2021 to $2,756.7 million in 2022 \u2014 a drop of $391.6 million \u2014 indicating a potential impairment or strategic shift in that region. On another part of the filing, Starbucks explains that in international markets, it heavily uses the licensed store model, which shifts operating costs and capital investments to licensees while Starbucks earns a margin on product sales and collects royalties. This model inherently requires less direct investment from Starbucks and may reduce the need for large goodwill balances associated with company-operated stores. Thus, the decline in goodwill may reflect a strategic pivot toward a lighter asset footprint in international markets through increased reliance on licensing, which aligns with Starbucks\u2019 operational model where local partners manage store-level capital and costs.",

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

      "answer": "Home Depot defines return on invested capital (ROIC) using NOPAT, which is reconciled to net earnings in their non-GAAP financial measures section. NOPAT serves as the numerator in the ROIC calculation and represents operating profits after tax but before financing costs. The retained earnings reconciliation on another page shows that net earnings of $16,433 million in fiscal 2022 flow into retained earnings, demonstrating how GAAP net earnings ultimately contribute to equity changes despite being distinct from the NOPAT metric used for capital efficiency analysis.",

      "answer": "The 6% increase in demand creation expense, driven by higher advertising and marketing costs, contrasts with the flat operating overhead expense, where lower wage-related expenses offset restructuring charges. This cost discipline in operating overhead, particularly in wage-related expenses, contributed to a 2% decrease in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes. Despite the rise in demand creation spending, the reduction in wage-related and technology costs helped stabilize overall operating overhead, leading to an improvement in the division\u2019s pre-tax loss.

      "answer": "GM explicitly lists advertising as one of the primary expenses within its Automotive segment, indicating that advertising spend is a direct operational cost tied to segment performance. However, in the non-GAAP reconciliation, EBIT-adjusted is used to evaluate core Automotive results, and this metric excludes certain items like impairment charges and restructuring costs, but does not specifically call out advertising as an adjustment. This suggests that advertising is considered a core operating expense, rather than an item to be excluded when measuring ongoing performance. Therefore, while advertising is a significant cost center within the Automotive segment, it is not treated as a non-core item in EBIT-adjusted, implying that management views advertising as integral to sustaining core business performance.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "The 140 basis point increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues was partially offset by 170 basis points of in-store operational efficiencies at the company level. However, in the international segment, only 100 basis points of operational efficiencies were noted, suggesting that the global rollout of efficiency initiatives may be less effective outside North America. This discrepancy highlights the uneven impact of cost management strategies across different markets, despite efforts to standardize operations.",

      "answer": "The $3.2 billion favorable price variance for GMNA, as disclosed in the consolidated performance section, indicates that pricing strategies significantly contributed to revenue growth. This aligns with the increase in GMNA fleet sales from 564,000 units in 2022 to 679,000 units in 2023, suggesting that GMNA not only sold more vehicles but also achieved higher pricing. This dual effect implies strong pricing power in the North American market, where both volume and pricing positively impacted financial performance.",

      "answer": "GM Financial reported $13.3 billion in dealer financing receivables at the end of 2023, indicating a significant portion of its commercial finance activities is tied to supporting dealerships. This aligns with its contribution of $14.2 billion to GM's total net sales and revenue for the year, showing that financial services are a meaningful revenue driver. Further analysis of GM Financial's revenue distribution reveals that $12.1 billion of its $14.2 billion in revenue originated from U.S. operations, suggesting that the growth in dealer financing is largely U.S.-centric and directly contributes to the company's overall revenue expansion.",

      "answer": "GM reported a 11.6% year-over-year revenue growth in GM Financial, indicating strong performance in its financial services segment. However, this positive trend contrasts with the $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge GM Financial recorded to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment, which was tied to the broader challenges in the China joint ventures. This reveals that while GM Financial as a segment is growing, it remains exposed to risks from its international investments, particularly in markets facing regulatory and competitive pressures like China.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How does the $0.1 billion sensitivity of GM Financial's Allowance for Loan Losses to a 5% relative change in recovery rates interact with the $2.7 billion growth in dealer financing exposure from 2022 to 2023, and what implications does this have for the adequacy of the allowance given the different methodologies applied to retail and commercial finance receivables?",
      "answer": "GM Financial disclosed that a 5% relative decrease in forecast recovery rates would increase the Allowance for Loan Losses by $0.1 billion, indicating a relatively low sensitivity to recovery rate volatility. However, dealer financing exposure grew significantly from $10.6 billion in 2022 to $13.3 billion in 2023 \u2014 a $2.7 billion increase \u2014 suggesting heightened credit risk concentration. This growth in commercial finance receivables, particularly dealer financing, is concerning because the allowance for commercial loans is based on historical loss experience and forecasted industry conditions, rather than the more dynamic modeling used for retail loans. The relatively small sensitivity amount may not fully capture the increased risk from the larger dealer financing portfolio, raising questions about the allowance's adequacy if economic conditions deteriorate or industry performance worsens beyond current forecasts.",

      "question": "Given Tesla's increasing warranty reserve exposure tied to its automotive segment and the 7% decline in automotive regulatory credit revenue between 2021 and 2022, what does this suggest about the financial pressures and revenue diversification challenges facing the automotive segment?",
      "answer": "Tesla's warranty reserve is primarily tied to its automotive segment, with significant accrued liabilities reflecting the scale of its vehicle sales and the inherent uncertainty in projecting future warranty costs (page 68). The automotive segment also generates revenue through automotive regulatory credits, which saw a $115 million (7%) decline from 2020 to 2021 (page 38). This decline in regulatory credit revenue, a historically significant income source, combined with the growing warranty liability, suggests increasing financial pressure on the automotive segment. This dynamic highlights challenges in revenue diversification, as Tesla may face reduced financial flexibility if core vehicle sales growth does not sufficiently offset the decline in regulatory credit income and rising service obligations.",

        "Hop 1: TSLA(page_68) \u2192 Automotive Segment: Warranty reserve exposure is primarily related to the automotive segment, with significant liabilities tied to vehicle sales and uncertain future costs.",

We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How should we interpret Nike's 2% improvement in Global Brand Divisions' pre-tax loss given their disclosure that certain corporate costs, including administrative expenses, are not included in EBIT?",
      "answer": "Nike reported a 2% decrease in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes, which they attributed to lower operating overhead expenses, including reductions in wage-related expenses, technology spending, and other administrative costs. However, in a separate section, Nike clarifies that certain corporate costs\u2014such as administrative expenses\u2014are not included in EBIT. This creates a nuanced interpretation: the improvement in the pre-tax loss may reflect cost-cutting in administrative areas, but since those costs are excluded from EBIT, the reported EBIT performance may not fully reflect the underlying cost structure of the Global Brand Divisions. Thus, while the 2% improvement suggests operational efficiency, the exclusion of corporate costs from EBIT means that the full financial impact of administrative cost changes is not captured in the primary performance metric used by the company.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "The $2.059 billion year-over-year decline in GM International's net sales (from $15.949 billion in 2023 to $13.890 billion in 2024) reflects specific financial performance pressures within that segment. However, GM's broader non-U.S. automotive revenue of $31.07 billion in 2024 includes not only GM International's results but also contributions from other international operations, particularly equity ownership stakes in entities like those in China marketing Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, and Wuling vehicles. This distinction shows that while the GM International segment itself underperformed, other international business arrangements\u2014such as joint ventures and partnerships\u2014helped sustain a larger non-U.S. revenue base, aligning with GM\u2019s strategic focus on global market access through multiple structures.",

Business\n\nGeneral Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, G eneral Motors or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development of autonomous vehicle (AV ) technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs)  and  AV s,  software-enabled  services  and  subscriptions  and  new  business  opportunities,  while  strengthening  our  market  position  in  profitable  internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\n\nElectric Vehicles We are offering customers choice with our diverse EV  lineup. A key element in our EV  strategy is our dedicated EV  propulsion architecture. Our current-generation, flexible EV  platform is being deployed across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, leveraging our technology to expand our EV portfolio over a wide and growing variety of segments and price points. With our next-generation battery technology, we intend to expand to multiple chemistries, multiple form factors and multiple cell suppliers as we continue to deliver even more EV choices for our customers.\n\nTo support our expanding portfolio of EV s, we have made significant investments in our plants across North America. GM's Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center is a fully dedicated EV  facility which produces a variety of vehicles, including the GMC HUMMER EV  Pickup and SUV , the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the recently launched Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, with globally sourced parts. GM's CAMI Assembly is Canada's first full-scale EV  manufacturing facility. We plan to convert Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan to build electric pickups, with the plant slated to begin production in 2026. GM is also investing in our propulsion, stamping and components plants to support EV production. We are mass-producing battery cells for these and other future EV s through Ultium Cells Holdings LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG  Energy Solution) in plants in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee, with plans to expand our battery cell manufacturing footprint, including in Indiana through a joint venture with Samsung SDI.\n\nGM's all-electric future is guided by customer choice and focused on delivering a world-class portfolio of EV s and an ecosystem to support them, while maintaining a compelling lineup of gas-powered vehicles. GM EV  drivers have access to more than 231,000 chargers across North America. This includes access to more than 20,000  Tesla  Superchargers  with  the  use  of  a  G M-approved  North American  Charging  Standard  adapter.  In  2024,  GM  also  announced  that  it  will  enhance  its collaboration with EV go to build 2,850 DC fast charging stalls, including 400 fast chargers at flagship destinations in major metropolitan areas across the U.S. GM is also a founding member of IONNA, a joint venture with seven other automakers aiming to create a high-powered charging network with a targeted installation of at least 30,000 chargers in urban and highway locations throughout North America. The joint venture broke ground on its first charging station in October 2024.\n\nSoftware-Enabled Services and Subscriptions Our vehicles are equipped with a suite of software-enabled services, including OnStar services, Super Cruise and others. With nearly three decades of experience, OnStar is a global leader in enabling automotive services. OnStar is currently available in 20 markets globally and growing. As  GM  introduces  more  software-defined  vehicles,  OnStar  is  playing  a  key  role  as  an  enabler  of  active  safety,  infotainment,  connectivity  and  driver assistance features. OnStar provides one ecosystem for retail and fleet customers to use, engage and shop through a broader set of service offerings available at and after vehicle purchase.

      "question": "How does GM's exposure to used vehicle price volatility through GM Financial's leasing portfolio impact its allowance for loan losses and depreciation expense, given the $0.9 billion in gains on lease terminations and the $22.7 billion estimated residual value of leased vehicles?",
      "answer": "GM's exposure to used vehicle price volatility is significant through GM Financial's leasing operations, where residual values are directly tied to used vehicle prices. In 2023, GM Financial recorded $0.9 billion in gains on lease terminations, a decrease from $1.2 billion in 2022, primarily due to higher net book values at termination and fewer lease terminations. This indicates that lower-than-expected used vehicle prices can reduce gains and increase depreciation. Additionally, GM Financial estimates the residual value of its leased vehicles at $22.7 billion as of December 31, 2023. If used vehicle prices weaken, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and potentially record impairment charges on the lease portfolio. This sensitivity is also reflected in the allowance for loan losses, where forecast recovery rates (influenced by used vehicle prices) directly impact the $2.3 billion allowance for retail loan losses. Thus, declining used vehicle prices would not only increase depreciation and impairments but could also necessitate higher loan loss provisions, directly affecting both the income statement and balance sheet.",

      "question": "Given GM's reliance on GM Financial to support vehicle sales and market penetration, how does the decline in the allowance for loan losses from $1,978 million in 2020 to $1,886 million in 2021 align with the company's risk disclosures about GM Financial's exposure to credit losses and economic volatility?",
      "answer": "GM's reliance on GM Financial to support vehicle sales is closely tied to GM Financial's ability to maintain competitive financing services, which in turn depends on its financial health and risk exposure. The decline in the allowance for loan losses from $1,978 million in 2020 to $1,886 million in 2021 reflects a reduction in GM Financial's estimated credit losses, likely due to improved economic conditions and higher used vehicle prices in 2021, which increased recovery rates. However, GM's risk disclosures caution that GM Financial remains exposed to economic volatility, including fluctuations in charge-offs, delinquencies, and recovery rates, which could materially affect its operations and ability to support GM's sales. Thus, while the allowance decreased, the company still acknowledges significant uncertainty and risk, suggesting that this reduction should not be interpreted as a definitive sign of reduced exposure but rather as a reflection of short-term economic improvements.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

      "answer": "NIKE actively hedges foreign exchange risk associated with product costs, which are primarily generated through non-functional currency-denominated product purchases, to stabilize consolidated financial results (page_84). This strategy contributed to a 110 basis point increase in gross margin for the NIKE Brand in fiscal 2024, with lower product costs adding approximately 10 basis points to the margin improvement (page_39). However, foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to revenues generated by entities within the NIKE Brand geographic operating segments are managed centrally and reported under corporate revenues (page_88), suggesting that while hedging protects cost-side volatility, the financial impact of those hedges may not flow directly to the segment-level results. This separation implies that the NIKE Brand segment's performance may not fully reflect the effectiveness of the company's foreign exchange risk management strategy, which is instead captured at the corporate level.",

First, an unfavorable mix effect of $0.4 billion from increased crossover and EV sales worked against the pricing benefit. Additionally, a $1.6 billion decline due to lower volume and a $1.1 billion negative impact from other factors \u2014 primarily foreign currency changes in the Mexican peso \u2014 further reduced revenue.

      "question": "How does GM's significant impairment charge related to its China joint ventures, including the $0.3 billion impairment of GM Financial's SAIC-GMAC investment, reconcile with GM Financial's relatively small 'Other income' of $435 million in 2022, and what does this suggest about the financial resilience of GM Financial in light of its exposure to Chinese automotive finance entities?",
      "answer": "GM recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on GM Financial's SAIC-GMAC investment due to deteriorating market conditions in China, including intense competition and regulatory pressures. This impairment reflects a material negative impact on GM Financial\u2019s investment portfolio. However, GM Financial's 'Other income' in 2022 was only $435 million, which suggests that this impairment charge was significant relative to GM Financial's non-core income streams. The juxtaposition of a large impairment against a relatively modest 'Other income' figure raises concerns about GM Financial\u2019s ability to absorb such losses without affecting its broader financial stability, especially given its exposure to Chinese automotive finance entities like SAIC-GMAC. This indicates that GM Financial's earnings may be more vulnerable to international market disruptions than suggested by its core income sources alone.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSGM is a joint venture we established with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) (50%). SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "The 6% increase in demand creation expense, largely attributed to higher digital marketing spend, aligns with the Global Brand Divisions' responsibility for managing global digital operations and enterprise technology. Despite a decrease in the division's overall loss due to lower wage-related and technology expenses, the rise in demand creation reflects a strategic emphasis on digital engagement and brand visibility. This investment in digital marketing supports the broader operational mandate of the Global Brand Divisions, which includes centrally managed product creation, design, and digital infrastructure, suggesting a coordinated effort to strengthen digital capabilities across the NIKE brand ecosystem.",

      "answer": "The goodwill balance for the International segment increased from $2,691.1 million in fiscal 2023 to $2,788.5 million in fiscal 2024, reflecting a $97.4 million addition. Despite this increase in goodwill, the International segment's revenue was negatively impacted by $69 million due to lower product and equipment sales and royalty revenues, along with an additional $27 million decline from unfavorable foreign currency translation. This suggests that while Starbucks continues to allocate goodwill to the International segment, the segment faced real revenue pressures that could affect the long-term valuation of that goodwill.",

      "answer": "The International segment's operating loss in 2021 occurred despite a 22% sales growth, which included contributions from advertising sales. However, this growth was offset by increased operating costs such as shipping, fulfillment, wage rates, and marketing expenses. Additionally, foreign exchange rate fluctuations had a $435 million impact on operating income in 2021, further contributing to the loss. While advertising sales helped mitigate some of the cost pressures, they were not sufficient to prevent the segment from reporting an operating loss. This contrast highlights that while advertising sales contributed positively to revenue, the segment faced significant cost and margin pressures that led to an overall decline in profitability.",

      "question": "How does the increase in Demand Creation Expense, driven by higher advertising and digital marketing costs, impact the financial performance of the Global Brand Divisions, especially considering their minimal revenue contribution relative to other segments?",
      "answer": "The increase in Demand Creation Expense, which rose to $4,285 million in FY2024 from $4,060 million in FY2023, was primarily driven by higher advertising and digital marketing costs. This increase contributed to a smaller decline in the Global Brand Divisions' pre-tax loss, which decreased by only 2% year-over-year despite lower operating overhead expenses. However, the Global Brand Divisions contributed only $102 million in total revenues in FY2024, a negligible portion compared to the $44,436 million generated by the broader NIKE Brand and $2,346 million by CONVERSE. This suggests that while the company is investing more in brand creation efforts at the global level, the financial return in terms of revenue from these centralized activities remains limited, raising questions about the efficiency and ROI of these demand creation investments in the context of overall segment profitability.",

      "question": "How does GM Financial's reported revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 align with its 2024 impairment charge related to the SAIC-GMAC investment, and what does this suggest about its exposure to the Chinese automotive finance market?",
      "answer": "GM Financial reported revenue growth from $12,766 million in 2022 to $14,225 million in 2023, indicating a positive financial trajectory. However, in 2024, GM Financial recorded a $300 million other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its investment in SAIC-GMAC, a Chinese automotive finance joint venture. This impairment suggests that despite overall revenue growth, GM Financial faced significant risks and valuation challenges in its China-focused financial services investments. The contrast between growing revenues and the subsequent impairment indicates that GM Financial's expansion and performance in the Chinese market may have been accompanied by increasing exposure to volatile or structurally challenged assets, particularly in the automotive finance sector.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How does GM's accounting treatment of selling, general and administrative people-related costs within its Automotive Segment impact segment-level profitability metrics following recent restructuring actions?",
      "answer": "GM's EBIT-adjusted metric excludes certain strategic costs like restructuring charges but includes selling, general and administrative (SG&A) people-related costs as part of segment expenses. Specifically, restructuring actions related to Buick dealerships and Russia shutdowns are excluded from EBIT-adjusted calculations, while SG&A people-related costs remain included. This creates a situation where segment-level profitability (as measured by EBIT-adjusted) may appear stronger than actual operational performance, since the costs directly tied to executing restructuring efforts remain embedded in the segment's financial reporting. The inclusion of SG&A people-related costs contrasts with the exclusion of strategic restructuring charges, creating a nuanced view of Automotive Segment profitability that requires careful analysis of both the non-GAAP adjustments and segment expense disclosures.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "GM recorded cumulative restructuring charges related to Cruise of $1.7 billion across 2023 and 2024, including $529 million in 2023 and $631 million in 2024, primarily tied to the indefinite delay of the Cruise Origin and the decision to stop funding Cruise\u2019s robotaxi development. Additionally, in 2024, GM recognized $142 million in impairment charges related to the write-off of technology and intellectual property associated with Cruise. This indicates that the strategic pivot away from Cruise\u2019s autonomous vehicle development not only involved significant restructuring costs but also led to substantial asset impairments, reflecting the broader financial impact of the operational and strategic changes.",

In conjunction with these actions, Cruise recorded charges before noncontrolling interest of $529 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which included noncash restructuring charges of $250 million. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin and recognized primarily non-cash charges before noncontrolling interest of $631 million. In December 2024, in conjunction with GM's announcement of its decision to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and its plans, subject to approval by the Cruise Board of Directors, to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges before noncontrolling interest of $522 million, which included net non-cash restructuring charges of $173 million. The non-cash restructuring charges are not reflected in the table above. Cumulatively, we have incurred $287 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities.

We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn the year ended December 31, 2024, we recorded restructuring charges of $200 million, primarily in GMNA, related to employee separations.As of December 31, 2024, we have incurred $163 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring actions. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities to be substantially completed by the end of 2025.\n\nIn March 2023, we announced a VSP to accelerate attrition related to the cost reduction program announced in January 2023. We recorded charges in GMNA of $1.0 billion in the year ended December 31, 2023, primarily related to employee separation charges of $905 million, which are reflected in the table above, and non-cash pension curtailment and settlement charges of approximately $130 million, not reflected in the table above. We incurred cash outflows of $58 million and $820 million in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. This program is complete as of December 31, 2024.\n\nIn October 2023, Cruise voluntarily paused all of its driverless, supervised and manual AV  operations in the U.S. while it ex amined its processes, systems and tools. In conjunction with these actions, Cruise recorded charges before noncontrolling interest of $529 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which included noncash restructuring charges of $250 million. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin and recognized primarily non-cash charges before noncontrolling interest of $631 million. In December 2024, in conjunction with GM's announcement of its decision to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and its plans, subject to approval by the Cruise Board of Directors, to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges before noncontrolling interest of $522 million, which included net non-cash restructuring charges of $173 million. The non-cash restructuring charges are not reflected in the table above. Cumulatively, we have incurred $287 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities. We expect the remaining cash outflows related to these activities of approximately $389 million to be completed by the end of 2025.\n\n## Note 19. Interest Income and Other Non-Operating Income\n\n",

      "answer": "The decline in GM Financial's allowance for loan losses from $1,978 million in 2020 to $1,886 million in 2021 indicates an improvement in the expected credit losses on the finance receivables. This aligns with GM\u2019s acknowledgment on page 24 that GM Financial\u2019s ability to provide competitive financing is influenced by the performance of its loan and lease portfolio, including charge-offs and delinquencies. The reduction in the allowance suggests that these credit risk factors may have improved during this period, thereby supporting GM\u2019s broader strategy of using GM Financial to facilitate vehicle sales. However, the continued reliance on GM Financial means that any future deterioration in portfolio performance could directly impact GM\u2019s ability to sustain or grow vehicle financing and, consequently, sales.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "Nike reported a 2% decrease in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes, which was primarily attributed to lower operating overhead expenses, including reductions in wage-related expenses, technology spend, and other administrative costs. This indicates that cost-cutting measures had a direct positive impact on the EBIT performance of the Global Brand Divisions. However, despite this improvement, the Global Brand Divisions contributed only $102 million in revenue out of Nike\u2019s total revenues of $46,710 million\u2014less than 0.2%. This minimal revenue contribution, coupled with the segment still reporting a loss, implies that the Global Brand Divisions, while strategically central to brand management and digital operations, are not a revenue driver but rather a cost center focused on long-term brand development and infrastructure support.",

      "answer": "The increase in net advertising expense by $135 million (from $909 million to $1,044 million) between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 suggests a strategic decision to elevate advertising spend. However, this figure represents a 'net' amount after accounting for co-op advertising allowances from vendors, which are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors' products. These allowances are recorded as an offset against advertising expense. Therefore, the gross advertising spend was likely higher than the $1,044 million reported, with the difference being covered by vendor contributions. This dynamic indicates that Home Depot leveraged vendor support to manage a portion of its growing advertising costs during a period of increased marketing activity.",

As of January 30, 2022 and January 31, 2021, our performance obligations for unredeemed gift cards were $1.0 billion and $839 million, respectively. Gift card breakage income, which is our estimate of the portion of our gift card balance not expected to be redeemed, is recognized in net sales and was immaterial in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019.\n\nWe also have agreements with third-party service providers who directly extend credit to customers, manage our PLCC program, and own the related receivables. We have evaluated the third-party entities holding the receivables under the program and concluded that they should not be consolidated. The agreement with the primary third-party service provider for our PLCC program expires in 2028, with us having the option, but no obligation, to purchase the existing receivables at the end of the agreement. Deferred interest charges incurred for our deferred financing programs offered to these customers, interchange fees charged to us for their use of the cards, and any profit sharing with the third-party service providers are included in net sales.\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nCost of sales includes the actual cost of merchandise sold and services performed; the cost of transportation of merchandise from vendors to our distribution network, stores, or customers; shipping and handling costs from our stores or distribution network to customers; and the operating cost and depreciation of our sourcing and distribution network. Vendor allowances that are not reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs are also included within cost of sales.\n\n## Vendor Allowances\n\nVendor allowances primarily consist of volume rebates that are earned as a result of attaining certain purchase levels and co-op advertising allowances for the promotion of vendors' products that are typically based on guaranteed minimum amounts with additional amounts being earned for attaining certain purchase levels. These vendor allowances are accrued as earned, with those allowances received as a result of attaining certain purchase levels accrued over the incentive period based on estimates of purchases. Volume rebates and certain co-op advertising allowances reduce the carrying cost of inventory and are recognized in cost of sales when the related inventory is sold.\n\n## Selling, General and Administrative\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses include compensation and benefits for retail and store support center associates, occupancy and operating costs of retail locations and store support centers, insurance-related expenses, advertising costs, credit and debit card processing fees, and other administrative costs.\n\n## Advertising Expense\n\nAdvertising costs, including digital, television, radio and print, are expensed when the advertisement first appears. Certain co-op advertising allowances that are reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to promote vendors' products are recorded as an offset against advertising expense.

      "question": "How does Nike's increased advertising and marketing spend in fiscal 2022 relate to the financial performance of its Global Brand Divisions, especially in light of the reported revenue declines in key geographic regions and product categories?",
      "answer": "Nike's advertising and marketing expense increased significantly in fiscal 2022, contributing to a 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes. This rise in demand creation costs occurred alongside declines in key revenue drivers, including a 13% currency-neutral revenue drop in Greater China and double-digit decreases in NIKE Direct digital and comparable store sales. Despite these revenue challenges, the company continued to invest heavily in brand-building activities, with Global Brand Divisions primarily representing demand creation and operating overhead expenses, including centrally managed product design and digital operations. This strategic choice to maintain or increase advertising spend, even in the face of declining revenues and geographic market pressures, suggests a prioritization of long-term brand strength over short-term profitability.",

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. NIKE Direct revenues decreased 12% due to digital sales declines of 15% and comparable store sales declines of 14%, in part due to reduced physical retail traffic as a result of government restrictions due to COVID-19 as well as ongoing marketplace dynamics, partially offset by the addition of new stores.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues decreased 10%, driven primarily by lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 7%, while lower ASP per pair reduced footwear revenues by approximately 3 percentage points, driven by lower NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues decreased 21%, due primarily to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel decreased 15%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 6 percentage points, primarily due to lower NIKE Direct and fullprice ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nReported EBIT decreased 27% due to lower revenues, gross margin contraction and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased approximately 390 basis points, reflecting impacts from COVID-19 related government restrictions which reduced physical retail traffic and led to higher inventory obsolescence reserves recognized primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin was also largely due to higher product costs and lower NIKE Direct margins. This activity was partially offset by favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Growth in demand creation expense was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense. Operating overhead expense increased largely due to higher wage-related costs and higher strategic technology investments.",

      "answer": "Nike's Global Brand Divisions experienced a 2% decrease in their loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2024, partly due to lower operating overhead expenses, which included reduced technology spend. This reduction in technology spend, as disclosed on page 39, contributed to the improved financial performance of the Global Brand Divisions. Despite this cost-saving measure, the Global Brand Divisions generated only $102 million in revenues in fiscal 2024, a negligible portion compared to the $44.4 billion from the Nike Brand and $2.3 billion from Converse. Thus, while lower technology spending helped reduce costs, the segment's minimal revenue contribution highlights the ongoing challenge of aligning expenses with limited income generation.",

Despite this support, Cruise's net sales remained flat at $102 million in both 2022 and 2023, as reported in the segment revenue variance table. Furthermore, Cruise's revenue contribution to GM's total net sales of $171.8 billion in 2023 was minimal at just 0.06%, indicating a strategic investment phase rather than a revenue-generating segment in the near term.",

      "answer": "GM recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to fair value due to market challenges in China, which is part of GM Financial's broader portfolio. This impairment charge comes after two years of stable leased vehicle income reported by GM Financial\u2014$7,266 million in 2023 and $7,811 million in 2022. The decline in asset value of SAIC-GMAC suggests a weakening in the financial performance or outlook of this joint venture, which raises questions about the sustainability of future leased vehicle income streams tied to these operations. This indicates a potential disconnect between recent impairment pressures and the historically stable leased vehicle income, suggesting that the impairment may signal a shift in the financial health of GM Financial\u2019s leasing activities in China.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "GM Financial adjusts residual values of leased vehicles based on third-party data, including auction values and market conditions, and revises them periodically during the lease term. This approach reflects sensitivity to external economic factors and market volatility (page 63). In the impairment analysis of SAIC-GMAC, GM used discounted cash flow models with key assumptions such as a 13.0% discount rate, 3.5% long-term growth rate, and alignment with Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share (page 76). Both GM Financial and GM's impairment analysis rely on forward-looking market assumptions and external economic indicators. However, while GM Financial's residual value estimates are adjusted throughout the lease term based on observable market data, the impairment testing of SAIC-GMAC relied on long-term projections and unobservable Level 3 inputs, indicating a more speculative and less frequent reassessment of value. This contrast highlights different risk management approaches for short-term lease assets versus long-term equity investments.",

In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.4 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales Incentives The estimated effect of sales incentives offered to dealers and end customers is recorded as a reduction of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate of customer acceptance of incentive programs, all of which are estimated based on historical experience and assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by approximately $0.4 billion. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables portfolio consists of smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses ex pected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a weighted-average remaining life of approximately two years. GM Financial forecasts net credit losses based on relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates, there can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that our credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Each 5% relative decrease/increase in the forecast recovery rates would increase/decrease the allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the U.S. retail finance receivables portfolio of $2.1 billion. If the forecast economic conditions were based entirely on the weakest scenario considered, the allowance for loan losses would increase by $0.2 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of financing products for dealers and other businesses. GM Financial provides commercial lending  products  to  its  dealer  customers  that  include  floorplan  financing,  also  known  as  wholesale  or  inventory  financing,  which  is  lending  to  finance  vehicle inventory. GM Financial also provides dealer loans, which are loans to finance improvements to dealership facilities, to provide working capital, or to purchase and/or finance dealership real estate. Additionally, GM Financial provides lending products to commercial vehicle upfitters and advances to certain of our subsidiaries. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry conditions. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nValuation of GM Financial Equipment on Operating Lease Assets and Residuals GM Financial has investments in leased vehicles recorded as operating leases. Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At the inception of a lease, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from one to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices.\n\nDuring the term of a lease, GM Financial periodically evaluates the estimated residual value and may adjust the value downward, which increases the prospective depreciation, or upward (limited to the contractual residual value), which decreases the prospective depreciation.",

Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect market assumptions based on the best evidence available. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy: Level 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets; Level 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and model-derived valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable Debt Securities We generally classify marketable debt securities as available-for-sale. V arious factors, including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value with non-credit related unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Noncredit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent non-binding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of ex it prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover expected credit losses on the finance receivables. For retail finance receivables, GM Financial uses static pool modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected remaining life of the finance receivables. The economic forecasts incorporate factors which vary by region that GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Cost is determined on a first-in, first-out (FIFO) basis.  Net realizable value is the estimated  selling  price  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business  less  cost  to  sell,  and  considers  general  market  and  economic  conditions,  periodic  reviews  of  current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Inventories are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete, with a primary focus on productive material, supplies, work in process and parts and accessories.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of typically two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on forecasted auction proceeds when there is a reliable basis to make such a determination. Realization of the residual values is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is  evaluated  over  the  life  of  the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes.",

      "answer": "In April 2021, GM increased the borrowing capacity of its 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for GM Financial to support its financing activities. GM Financial, in turn, issued $25.8 billion in revolving credit facilities and $23.3 billion in securitization notes payable in 2021, showing its reliance on robust access to capital to sustain its operations. However, the 2022 risk disclosures emphasize that GM's ability to expand market penetration, especially in advanced technologies like autonomous vehicles (AVs), depends on GM Financial's continued access to competitive financing. If GM Financial faces disruptions in funding sources\u2014such as through securitization programs, credit facilities, or unsecured debt\u2014this could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers, directly impacting GM's sales and electrification strategy.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in Operating Overhead Expense impact the Global Brand Divisions' loss position, considering their minimal revenue contribution compared to other NIKE Brand segments?",
      "answer": "The Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes decreased by 2% in fiscal 2024, primarily due to a reduction in Operating Overhead Expense, which includes wage-related expenses, technology spend, and other administrative costs. Operating Overhead Expense is a key component of the Global Brand Divisions' cost structure, which also includes Demand Creation and centrally managed product design expenses. Despite this cost reduction, the Global Brand Divisions generated only $102 million in revenues in fiscal 2024\u2014significantly less than the revenues from geographic segments like North America ($18,353 million) or Europe, Middle East & Africa ($12,479 million). This minimal revenue contribution highlights that the division largely functions as a cost center focused on brand management and digital infrastructure rather than revenue generation. Therefore, the improvement in the loss position was driven by cost discipline rather than revenue growth, underscoring the importance of overhead management in mitigating the financial impact of a low-revenue, high-cost function.",

      "question": "How does Cruise's utilization of its $3.4 billion credit facility with GM Financial compare with GM Financial's broader commercial financing activities, particularly in light of Cruise's liquidity position and GM's strategic funding arrangements?",
      "answer": "Cruise had only drawn $0.3 billion from its $3.4 billion credit facility with GM Financial as of December 31, 2023, indicating limited utilization of this funding source despite its availability through 2024. This credit facility is specifically earmarked to fund purchases of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and related equipment from GM, aligning with Cruise's strategic dependence on GM for hardware development. Meanwhile, GM Financial's broader commercial finance receivables totaled $13.3 billion in dealer financing and $476 million in other financing at year-end 2023, showing that Cruise's draw is a small fraction of GM Financial's overall financing activity. This contrast suggests that while GM Financial plays a significant role in supporting Cruise\u2019s capital-intensive operations, Cruise has not yet tapped heavily into this internal credit line, possibly reflecting cautious spending or alternative liquidity sources.",

        "Hop 1: GM(page_42) \u2192 Cruise: GM provides a multi-year credit agreement through GM Financial allowing Cruise to borrow up to $3.4 billion through 2024 to fund AV purchases from GM, with $0.3 billion drawn as of year-end.",
        "Hop 2: Cruise \u2192 GM Financial: Cruise\u2019s borrowing from GM Financial is a targeted financing mechanism tied to AV procurement, not general operational funding.",

      "answer": "GM reports $13.3 billion in dealer financing through GM Financial as part of commercial finance receivables, which are net of dealer cash management balances of $2.6 billion at year-end 2023. GM Financial determines the allowance for loan losses on these receivables based on historical loss experience and forecasted auto industry conditions, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses. In a separate section, it is disclosed that each 5% relative decrease in forecast recovery rates would increase the allowance for loan losses by $0.1 billion, and at December 31, 2023, the allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio was $2.3 billion.

      "question": "How does the growth in GMNA's reported sales from 2022 to 2023 relate to the volume variance contribution to revenue growth, and what does this imply about the role of unit sales in GMNA's performance?",
      "answer": "GMNA's reported sales increased from $128,378 million in 2022 to $141,445 million in 2023, a growth of $13,067 million or 10.2%. According to the variance analysis, $8.5 billion of this growth was attributed to volume, indicating that the increase in units sold was the primary driver of revenue growth. This suggests that GMNA's performance was significantly influenced by higher sales volume, rather than changes in product mix or pricing. Therefore, the growth in GMNA's revenue is closely tied to its ability to sell more vehicles, highlighting the importance of volume in its financial performance.",

      "answer": "The $9 billion unfavorable change in Eliminations from 2023 to 2024, as disclosed on page 33, offsets part of the reported $15.6 billion growth in total Net Sales and Revenue found on page 32. This suggests that a portion of the growth in revenue\u2014especially between GMNA, Cruise, and GMFinancial\u2014may stem from internal transactions rather than external sales. Page 106 further shows that GMNA alone accounted for $140.5 billion in Net Sales and Revenue in 2024, indicating its dominant role in the consolidated total and raising questions about how intercompany eliminations affect the visibility of true external demand across segments.",

      "answer": "The Home Depot emphasizes ROIC as a key metric of capital deployment effectiveness, reporting it at 44.7% for fiscal 2021, up from 40.8% in fiscal 2020. This metric is calculated using NOPAT, which is defined in the glossary as 'net operating profit after tax.' The company's detailed reconciliation of NOPAT to GAAP net earnings in the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section shows that NOPAT excludes certain non-operational or non-recurring items, allowing investors to assess the core operating performance that drives ROIC. By linking NOPAT directly to ROIC and highlighting the increase in this metric, The Home Depot signals confidence in its ability to generate strong returns on its capital base, which includes both debt and equity. This aligns with their capital allocation strategy, which prioritizes share repurchases and dividends while maintaining disciplined investment in growth initiatives like store expansion and digital capabilities.",

We opened five new stores in the U.S. and two new stores in Mexico during fiscal 2021, resulting in a total store count of 2,317 at January 30, 2022, which includes 14 stores in the U.S. from a small acquisition completed during the second quarter of fiscal 2021. At the end of fiscal 2021, a total of 311 of our stores, or 13.4%, were located in Canada and Mexico. Total sales per retail square foot were $604.74 in fiscal 2021. Our inventory turnover ratio was 5.2 times at the end of fiscal 2021, compared to 5.8 times at the end of fiscal 2020. The decrease in our inventory turnover ratio was primarily driven by an increase in average inventory levels during fiscal 2021 to support the demand environment.\n\nWe generated $16.6 billion of cash flow from operations, issued $3.0 billion of long-term debt, net of discounts, and received $1.0 billion of net proceeds from short-term debt during fiscal 2021. This cash flow, together with cash on hand, was used to fund cash payments of $14.8 billion for share repurchases, pay $7.0 billion of dividends, fund $2.6 billion in capital expenditures, and repay an aggregate of $1.5 billion of long-term debt. In February 2022, we announced a 15% increase in our quarterly cash dividend to $1.90 per share.\n\nOur ROIC was 44.7% for fiscal 2021 and 40.8% for fiscal 2020. See the 'Non-GAAP Financial Measures' section below for our definition and calculation of ROIC, as well as a reconciliation of NOPAT, a non-GAAP financial measure, to net earnings (the most comparable GAAP financial measure).",

      "answer": "GM's decision to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development in December 2024 led to $522 million in net charges, including $173 million in non-cash restructuring charges. This decision appears to be a continuation of earlier financial actions taken in 2024, including the $142 million impairment charge recorded for the write-off of technology and intellectual property associated with Cruise. These charges indicate a progressive devaluation and strategic repositioning of Cruise-related assets, culminating in the restructuring actions disclosed later in the year. Together, these figures reflect a coordinated effort to reduce exposure to Cruise's autonomous vehicle initiatives and consolidate technical resources under GM.",

      "answer": "Lowe's manages commodity price risk operationally by adjusting selling prices, which are influenced by market prices and the competitive environment (page 36). This allows the company to offset some of the financial impact of volatile input costs. Separately, the company uses market price as a key input in valuing performance share units via Monte-Carlo simulations, which incorporate the market price of shares on grant dates (page 65). The dual use of market price\u2014both as a lever in pricing strategy and as a valuation input for equity compensation\u2014demonstrates a coordinated approach to managing financial exposure: one side stabilizes earnings through pricing agility, while the other aligns executive incentives with shareholder value in a volatile market context.",

      "question": "How do Starbucks' in-store operational efficiencies, which contributed to mitigating a 220 basis point contraction in international operating margin, relate to the 140 basis point increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, and what does this imply about the company's cost management effectiveness in its company-operated stores?",
      "answer": "Starbucks reported that in-store operational efficiencies offset approximately 100 basis points of a 220 basis point contraction in international operating margin (page 43). However, store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased by 140 basis points, primarily driven by higher wages, deleverage, and promotional activity, though partially offset by those same in-store operational efficiencies (page 40). Store operating expenses are further defined in page 66 as including wages, occupancy, and delivery commissions directly tied to store operations. This contrast suggests that while operational improvements helped cushion margin pressures, they were not sufficient to fully counterbalance rising labor and occupancy costs, indicating mixed effectiveness in cost containment despite efficiency gains.",

Also contributing to the decline in international total net revenues were lower product and equipment sales to, and royalty revenues from, our licensees ($69 million), largely driven by continued disruptions due to multiple international conflicts, partially offset by the performance of 654 net new licensed store openings over the past 12 months. These decreases were partially offset by net new company-operated store growth of 10%, or 893 stores, over the past 12 months ($378 million).\n\n## Operating Margin\n\nInternational operating income for fiscal 2024 decreased 15% to $1.0 billion, compared to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Operating margin contracted 220 basis points to 14.2%, primarily due to increased promotional activity (approximately 170 basis points) and investments in store partner wages and benefits (approximately 120 basis points), partially offset by in-store operational efficiencies (approx imately 100 basis points).",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

      "question": "Given GM Financial's $4,103 million in finance charge income in 2021, how does the company's reliance on this segment for customer financing align with the specific credit and market risks outlined in the risk factors that could impair its ability to support vehicle sales?",
      "answer": "GM Financial's $4,103 million in finance charge income in 2021 reflects its critical role in supporting customer financing, which directly enables vehicle sales by offering leasing and loan options. However, the risk factors section highlights that GM Financial faces credit risks tied to loan performance, including charge-offs and delinquencies, as well as market risks such as interest rate fluctuations and residual value volatility. These risks could impair GM Financial\u2019s ability to provide competitive financing, directly impacting GM's capacity to support additional vehicle sales. Therefore, while the finance charge income demonstrates the segment's profitability, its sustainability is contingent on managing these specific credit and market risks, which, if unmitigated, could disrupt the company's broader automotive sales strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - (Continued)\n\nin  active  markets,  quoted  prices  for  identical  or  similar  instruments  in  markets  that  are  not  active  and  model-derived  valuations whose significant inputs are observable; and Level 3 - Instruments whose significant inputs are unobservable.\n\nMarketable  Debt  Securities We  generally  classify  marketable  debt  securities  as  available-for-sale.  Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "GM's EBIT-adjusted guidance of $13.0 billion to $15.0 billion for the year ending December 31, 2022, incorporates the impact of equity income, which is explicitly noted to positively affect EBIT-adjusted. In 2021, GM reported $527 million in equity income from its joint ventures (primarily in China), and this figure directly contributed to the EBIT-adjusted increase. The financial performance analysis on page 37 highlights that favorable 'Other' factors, including increased equity income, were a key driver of EBIT-adjusted growth. Therefore, the inclusion of equity income as a component of EBIT-adjusted indicates that GM's guidance range assumes a continuation or strategic reliance on contributions from joint ventures, particularly in markets like China, to meet its adjusted earnings targets.",

We do not expect this shortage to impact our long-term growth and EV initiatives.  In  June  2021,  we  announced plans to increase our investment in EVs and AVs to more than $35.0 billion from 2020 through 2025, in part to accelerate battery and EV assembly capacity.\n\nWe also continue to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and government actions and measures taken to prevent its spread, and the potential to affect our operations.

The results of our joint ventures are recorded in Equity income, which is included in EBIT (loss)-adjusted above.\n\nGMI Total Net Sales and Revenue In the year ended December 31, 2021, Total net sales and revenue increased primarily due to: (1) favorable mix in South America, Asia/Pacific and the Middle East; (2) favorable pricing across multiple vehicle lines in South America; and (3) favorable Other primarily due to increased components, parts and accessories sales, partially offset by the foreign currency  effects  resulting  from  the  weakening  of  various  currencies  against  the  U.S.  dollar;  partially  offset  by  (4)  decreased wholesale  volumes  primarily  due  to  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage  and  the  wind-down  of  our  vehicle  sales  operations  in Australia, New Zealand and Thailand.\n\nGMI EBIT (loss)-Adjusted In the year ended December 31, 2021, EBIT-adjusted increased primarily due to: (1) favorable price; (2)  favorable  mix;  and  (3)  favorable  Other  primarily  due  to  increased  equity  income;  partially  offset  by  (4)  unfavorable  Cost primarily due to increased material costs; and (5) decreased wholesale volumes.\n\nWe view the Chinese market as important to our global growth strategy and are employing a multi-brand strategy. In the coming years  we  plan  to  leverage  our  global  architectures  to  increase  the  number  of  product  offerings  under  the  Buick,  Chevrolet  and Cadillac brands in China and continue to grow our business under the local Baojun and Wuling brands. We operate in the Chinese market through a number of joint ventures and maintaining strong relationships with our joint venture partners is an important part of our China growth strategy.\n\nThe following table summarizes certain key operational and financial data for the Automotive China JVs (vehicles in thousands):\n\n",

      "answer": "GM disclosed that GM Financial was liability-sensitive in 2021, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to reprice within twelve months, which would cause a decrease in net interest income during periods of rising interest rates. This sensitivity is a key financial risk, especially given GM Financial's reliance on variable rate debt and its exposure to interest rate fluctuations. Meanwhile, GM depends on GM Financial to provide competitive financing and leasing services to customers and dealers, which supports vehicle sales and market penetration. However, if interest rates rise and GM Financial's net interest income declines, it could face challenges in maintaining competitive financing offers, thereby potentially undermining GM's broader sales strategy. This creates a tension between GM Financial's financial exposure and its operational role in GM's automotive business strategy.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "The $2,756.7 million goodwill allocation to the International Segment reflects Starbucks' significant confidence in its licensing model strategy in international markets. The licensing model, which accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022, leverages local partners to expand access to desirable retail locations while reducing capital investment and operating costs. Despite having a lower gross margin than company-operated stores, the licensing model generates revenue through product sales and royalties, which Starbucks appears to view as sustainable enough to justify a substantial goodwill valuation. This suggests that the company sees the licensing model as a key driver of its international growth and long-term value creation.",

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

      "answer": "The 6% increase in demand creation expense, which included higher advertising and marketing costs, was partially offset by lower wage-related expenses that contributed to a 2% decrease in the Global Brand Divisions' pre-tax loss. Despite the increased investment in demand creation, the reduction in wage-related costs helped mitigate the financial impact, aligning with the company's broader cost management strategy reflected in the operating overhead expense being flat year-over-year. This cost discipline is also consistent with the Global Brand Divisions' role, which includes centrally managed demand creation and operating overhead expenses, and shows how strategic spending and cost reductions can coexist to improve financial performance.",

      "answer": "Starbucks reported a goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million allocated to the International segment as of September 29, 2024, with no impairment charge recorded because the fair value of the China reporting unit exceeded its carrying value. However, in another section, the International segment faced revenue declines from lower product and equipment sales and royalty revenues from licensees ($69 million impact), compounded by unfavorable foreign currency translation ($27 million). This raises questions about the optimism embedded in the goodwill valuation assumptions, particularly regarding future cash flow projections used in the income approach, given the current headwinds in the International market. The lack of impairment may reflect management's forward-looking confidence in recovery or strategic adjustments, despite near-term performance challenges.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "GM reported a $3.2 billion favorable price variance in net sales for 2023, which should have positively impacted profitability. However, despite this pricing tailwind, GM's EBIT-adjusted declined by $682 million year-over-year to $12,306 million in 2023. This decline was primarily driven by $5.1 billion in unfavorable cost impacts that more than offset the pricing and volume benefits. When viewed alongside GM's longer-term performance metrics, the company's ROIC-adjusted fell to 16.4% in 2023 from 20.0% in 2022 and 21.3% in 2021, suggesting that despite pricing strength, the company is facing structural cost pressures that are eroding its capital efficiency and profitability trajectory.",

      "answer": "The restructuring charges related to Cruise totaled $529 million in 2023 and $631 million in 2024, primarily due to the voluntary pause of AV operations in 2023 and the indefinite delay of the Cruise Origin in 2024. These charges included both cash and non-cash components, with non-cash restructuring charges of $250 million in 2023 and $631 million in 2024. In addition to these restructuring actions, GM recorded a $142 million impairment charge in 2024 specifically tied to the write-off of technology and intellectual property related to Cruise. This impairment reflects the diminished long-term value of Cruise's assets following the strategic decision to no longer fund robotaxi development and instead integrate Cruise's technical efforts into GM's broader autonomous and assisted driving initiatives. Together, these figures illustrate both the direct restructuring costs and the long-term asset devaluation resulting from the strategic pivot away from Cruise's standalone AV ambitions.",

      "answer": "GM discloses on page 24 that it depends heavily on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and dealers, and any impairment in GM Financial\u2019s ability to do so due to financial risks could negatively affect GM's vehicle sales. GM Financial, in turn, accounts for its loan portfolios and associated credit risks, including the use of static pool modeling and economic forecasts to estimate loan loss allowances, which directly affects its financial performance. In 2021, GM Financial generated $4,103 million in Finance Charge Income, a significant portion of its revenue. This creates a tension: while GM relies on GM Financial\u2019s financial health and lending capacity to support its automotive sales, GM Financial\u2019s ability to generate consistent income like Finance Charge Income is subject to economic volatility, credit losses, and regulatory changes, which could undermine both its own profitability and GM\u2019s broader sales strategy.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

      "question": "How does GM's exposure to variable interest rate commercial finance receivables, which totaled $7.662 billion in originations in 2020, impact GM Financial's liability-sensitive position as of December 31, 2021, and what risk does this pose to GM's automotive financing strategy given GM Financial's reliance on competitive financing rates to support vehicle sales?",
      "answer": "GM's exposure to variable interest rate commercial finance receivables, which totaled $7.662 billion in originations in 2020, directly affects GM Financial's interest rate risk profile. As of December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. This mismatch implies that rising interest rates would cause interest paid on liabilities to increase more quickly than interest earned on assets, initially decreasing net interest income. This sensitivity poses a risk to GM's automotive financing strategy, as GM Financial must maintain competitive financing rates to support vehicle sales. If GM Financial cannot sustain these rates due to compressed interest margins, it could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing services, which in turn could negatively affect GM's sales and market penetration efforts.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\n\n",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does the 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes relate to the $3,850 million in Demand Creation Expense reported in fiscal 2022, and what does this imply about the relationship between investment in demand creation and global brand performance?",
      "answer": "The 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes is directly tied to the rise in Demand Creation Expense, which reached $3,850 million in fiscal 2022. This increase in demand creation spending was primarily driven by higher advertising, marketing, and sports marketing costs, which are central components of the Global Brand Divisions' operating model. Despite the increased investment, the Global Brand Divisions only generated $102 million in revenues, indicating that these expenditures are strategic and long-term focused rather than immediately revenue-generating. This suggests that Nike views demand creation as a critical lever for brand strength and future revenue growth, even at the cost of near-term profitability in the Global Brand Divisions.",

      "answer": "GM's risk disclosure on page 24 highlights that GM Financial's ability to provide leasing and financing services depends on the performance of its loan and lease portfolio, particularly charge-offs, delinquencies, and prepayments. The company warns that poor portfolio performance could impair GM Financial\u2019s ability to support vehicle sales. On page 62, GM Financial explains that it uses static pool modeling and economic forecasts, including unemployment and interest rates, to estimate loan loss allowances. Specifically, for retail finance receivables, it evaluates expected losses over the life of the loans. Turning to page 70, the data shows that as of December 31, 2020, $25.894 billion out of $26.183 billion (97.0%) of 2020-originated retail finance receivables were 0-to-30 days delinquent, indicating strong early performance. This suggests that, at least through the end of 2020, the portfolio was performing well, which may have supported GM Financial\u2019s ability to continue offering competitive financing and, in turn, supported GM\u2019s vehicle sales. However, the risk disclosure implies that any deterioration in these metrics could threaten this dynamic.",

For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

      "answer": "Tesla's inclusion of 'sales of solar energy systems incentives' within the Energy Generation and Storage segment's revenue highlights the integration of government and regulatory incentives into Tesla's financial model for this segment. This aligns with Tesla's broader strategy of monetizing clean energy offerings beyond just product sales, treating incentives as a revenue stream rather than a cost offset. By explicitly listing these incentives as part of the segment's revenue, Tesla underscores the strategic importance of leveraging policy frameworks to enhance the economic viability of its solar and storage solutions. This treatment contrasts with other segments like Automotive, where regulatory credits are treated separately from core product revenue, indicating a differentiated financial and strategic approach to the Energy Generation and Storage segment.",

Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",

      "answer": "GM reported $4.5 billion in Finance Charge Income from GM Financial in 2022, indicating strong financial services performance. However, by 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion impairment charge against its SAIC-GMAC investment due to deteriorating market conditions in China, including excess capacity and regulatory pressures. This suggests a decline in the value of GM Financial\u2019s investments, particularly in China, which contrasts with earlier financial performance metrics like the 2022 finance charge income.

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

Despite GMFinancial\u2019s strong growth, its total revenue contribution in 2024 ($13,575 million) remains significantly smaller than the automotive segment\u2019s $140,536 million in U.S. revenue alone. This suggests that while GMFinancial is growing and contributes meaningfully to consolidated performance, the automotive business remains the dominant and strategically central component of GM\u2019s operations.",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial for commercial financing align with the concentration risk implied by the 2022 origination distribution of commercial finance receivables, particularly given GM Financial's methodology for estimating loan loss allowances?",
      "answer": "GM's reliance on GM Financial for commercial financing is a strategic dependency that supports its automotive sales and dealer network operations. However, GM Financial's methodology for estimating loan loss allowances on commercial finance receivables relies heavily on historical loss experience and forecasted industry vehicle sales, which introduces estimation risk. The 2022 origination distribution shows a heavy concentration in recent years\u2014$6,968 million originated in 2020 alone, representing 90.5% of total receivables\u2014indicating a relatively new and concentrated portfolio. This concentration could amplify credit risk if economic conditions deteriorate or if vehicle sales forecasts are overly optimistic, especially since the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates that may not fully capture risks in a rapidly changing market. Therefore, while GM depends on GM Financial to support dealer financing, the high concentration and estimation-based allowance suggest a potential vulnerability in credit risk management.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "question": "Given the stability of the Corporate and Other segment's $1.0 million goodwill balance over the three fiscal years, how does Starbucks' detailed audit disclosure around the $2,788.5 million international segment goodwill, particularly the China reporting unit, reflect a differentiated risk profile between these goodwill components?",
      "answer": "Starbucks' consolidated goodwill balance grew from $3,283.5 million in 2022 to $3,315.7 million in 2024, with the Corporate and Other segment maintaining a constant $1.0 million balance throughout. In contrast, the international segment's goodwill, which includes the China reporting unit, increased from $2,756.7 million in 2022 to $2,788.5 million in 2024. The audit report on page 92 singles out the China reporting unit for special scrutiny due to the complexity and subjectivity involved in its goodwill impairment assessment, which relies on forward-looking cash flow projections and market multiples. This highlights a significant contrast: while the Corporate and Other segment's goodwill is stable and negligible, the international segment's goodwill\u2014dominated by China\u2014is deemed a critical audit matter due to its materiality and the inherent estimation uncertainties. Thus, the Corporate and Other segment's goodwill appears immaterial and stable, whereas the international segment's goodwill, particularly China's portion, represents a focal point of financial risk and auditor attention.",

        "Hop 1: SBUX(page_78) \u2192 Corporate and Other Segment: The Corporate and Other segment's goodwill balance remained unchanged at $1.0 million across all three fiscal years (2022\u20132024), indicating stability and likely immateriality.",
        "Hop 2: Corporate and Other Segment \u2192 Goodwill Balance: The $1.0 million goodwill balance in the Corporate and Other segment contributes to the overall consolidated goodwill but represents a negligible portion of the total $3,315.7 million as of 2024.",

      "answer": "Nike's Global Brand Divisions reported a 17% increase in pre-tax loss for fiscal 2022, partly due to higher strategic technology investments and digital capabilities spending. This increase in operating overhead expense was driven by a deliberate focus on technology modernization. However, despite these investments, the company reported a 15% decline in NIKE Direct digital sales and lower average selling prices (ASPs) in both footwear and apparel, driven by higher discounts and marketplace dynamics.

Higher operating overhead expense was primarily due to an increase in strategic technology investments, continued investment in digital capabilities and higher wage-related expenses.

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. NIKE Direct revenues decreased 12% due to digital sales declines of 15% and comparable store sales declines of 14%, in part due to reduced physical retail traffic as a result of government restrictions due to COVID-19 as well as ongoing marketplace dynamics, partially offset by the addition of new stores.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues decreased 10%, driven primarily by lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 7%, while lower ASP per pair reduced footwear revenues by approximately 3 percentage points, driven by lower NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues decreased 21%, due primarily to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel decreased 15%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 6 percentage points, primarily due to lower NIKE Direct and fullprice ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nReported EBIT decreased 27% due to lower revenues, gross margin contraction and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased approximately 390 basis points, reflecting impacts from COVID-19 related government restrictions which reduced physical retail traffic and led to higher inventory obsolescence reserves recognized primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin was also largely due to higher product costs and lower NIKE Direct margins. This activity was partially offset by favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Growth in demand creation expense was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense. Operating overhead expense increased largely due to higher wage-related costs and higher strategic technology investments.",

      "question": "How does GM's confidence in meeting liquidity requirements, supported by access to $15.5 billion in credit facilities, reconcile with the risks posed by GM Financial's dependence on external financing and exposure to residual value volatility in its leasing operations?",
      "answer": "GM expresses confidence in meeting liquidity requirements by citing $15.5 billion in available credit facilities and sufficient liquidity sources to fund future cash needs (page 38). However, GM Financial, which is integral to supporting vehicle sales through leasing and dealer financing, depends heavily on external financing sources and is exposed to risks such as residual value performance and used vehicle auction values (page 24). The company also notes that GM Financial\u2019s access to GM\u2019s credit facilities could provide additional flexibility, though no borrowings were outstanding as of December 31, 2021 (page 40). This creates a nuanced picture where GM\u2019s liquidity strength may buffer GM Financial\u2019s external financing risks, but GM Financial\u2019s performance volatility\u2014especially in leased vehicle income and residual values\u2014could still constrain its ability to support automotive sales, thereby indirectly affecting GM\u2019s broader business strategy.",

          "chunk_text": "\nGM Financial Revenue In the year ended December 31, 2021, Total revenue decreased primarily due to decreased leased vehicle income of $0.5 billion, primarily due to a decrease in the size of the leased vehicles portfolio; partially offset by increased finance charge income of $0.1 billion, primarily due to growth in the retail finance receivables portfolio, partially offset by a decrease in the effective yield and a decrease in the size of the commercial finance receivables portfolio.\n\nGM Financial  EBT-Adjusted In  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  EBT-adjusted  increased  primarily  due  to:  (1)  increased leased  vehicle  income  net  of  leased  vehicle  expenses  of  $1.2  billion  primarily  due  to  decreased  depreciation  on  leased  vehicles resulting from increased residual value estimates and a decrease in the size of the portfolio, as well as increased lease termination gains; (2) decreased provision for loan losses of $0.6 billion primarily due to a reduction in the reserve levels established at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of actual credit performance that was better than forecasted and favorable expectations for future  charge-offs  and  recoveries,  reflecting  improved  economic  conditions,  partially  offset  by  reserves  established  for  loans originated during the year ended December 31, 2021; (3) decreased interest expense of $0.5 billion due to decreased credit spreads on GM Financial debt, partially offset by an increase in the average debt outstanding; partially offset by (4) increased operating expenses of $0.2 billion in 2021. GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses includes a $0.1 billion loss on extinguishment of debt.\n\nLiquidity and Capital Resources We believe our current levels  of  cash,  cash  equivalents,  marketable  debt  securities,  available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities and other liquidity actions currently available to us are sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements. We also maintain access to the capital markets and may issue debt or equity securities, which may provide an additional  source  of  liquidity.  We  have  substantial  cash  requirements  going  forward,  which  we  plan  to  fund  through  our  total available liquidity, cash flows from operating activities and additional liquidity measures, if determined to be necessary.",

Over 90% of our cash and marketable debt securities were managed within North America and at our regional treasury centers at December 31, 2021. We have used and will continue to use other methods including intercompany loans to utilize these funds across our global operations as needed.\n\nOur cash equivalents and marketable debt securities balances are primarily denominated in U.S. Dollars and include investments in U.S. government and agency obligations, foreign government securities, time deposits, corporate debt securities and mortgage and asset-backed  securities.  Our  investment  guidelines,  which  we  may  change  from  time  to  time,  prescribe  certain  minimum  credit worthiness thresholds and limit our exposures to any particular sector, asset class, issuance or security type. The majority of our current investments in debt securities are with A/A2 or better rated issuers.\n\nWe use credit facilities as a mechanism to provide additional flexibility in managing our global liquidity. At December 31, 2020, the total size of our credit facilities was $18.5 billion, which consisted principally of four revolving credit facilities. In April 2021, we increased the total borrowing capacity of our five-year, $10.5 billion facility to $11.2 billion and extended the termination date for a $9.9 billion portion of the five-year facility by three years, now set to mature on April 18, 2026. The termination date of April 18, 2023 for the remaining portion of the five-year facility remains unchanged. We also renewed and increased the total borrowing capacity of our three-year, $4.0 billion facility to $4.3 billion, which now matures on April 7, 2024, and renewed our 364-day, $2.0 billion facility allocated for exclusive use by GM Financial, which now matures on April 6, 2022. We also terminated a separate 364-day, $2.0 billion revolving credit facility, entered into in May 2020. Additionally, the prior restrictions on share repurchases and dividends on our common shares were removed upon entrance into the renewed three-year, $4.3 billion facility. In December 2021, we terminated our three-year, $2.0 billion transformation credit facility. At December 31, 2021, the total size of our credit facilities was $15.5 billion, which consisted primarily of two credit facilities.\n\nIf available capacity permits, GM Financial has access to our revolving credit facilities. GM Financial did not have borrowings outstanding against our revolving credit facilities at December 31, 2021 or 2020. Refer to Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on credit facilities. We had intercompany loans from GM Financial of $0.2 billion and $0.4 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, which primarily consisted of commercial loans to dealers we consolidate, and we had no intercompany loans to GM Financial. Refer to Note 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n\nSeveral of our loan facilities, including our revolving credit facilities, require compliance with certain financial and operational covenants as well as regular reporting to lenders. We have reviewed our covenants in effect as of December 31, 2021 and determined we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance in the future.\n\nGM Financial's Board of Directors declared and paid dividends of $3.5 billion, $0.8 billion, and $0.4 billion on its common stock in  2021,  2020,  and  2019.  Current  dividend  levels  are  reflective  of  GM  Financial  earnings  supported  by  strong  residual  values, favorable  credit  performance  and  improved  economic  conditions.  Future  dividends  from  GM  Financial  will  depend  on  several factors including business and economic conditions, its financial condition, earnings, liquidity requirements and leverage ratio.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial's commercial finance receivables of $13.3 billion at year-end relate to the treatment of finance charge income as a primary source of cash, given the accounting methodology described for recognizing finance charge income on delinquent accounts?",
      "answer": "GM's segment reporting on page 72 shows that GM Financial holds $13.3 billion in commercial finance receivables as of December 31, 2023. According to page 43, GM Financial identifies finance charge income as a primary source of cash, which directly depends on the performance and collectability of these receivables. However, page 64 clarifies that finance charge income on commercial receivables is suspended when accounts are more than 90 days delinquent or in bankruptcy, with payments applied first to principal. This creates a dependency where the $13.3 billion in receivables contributes to liquidity only if accounts remain current, highlighting a risk that delinquencies could materially impact the cash flow GM Financial relies on.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GM(page_72) \u2192 GM Financial: GM reports GM Financial's commercial finance receivables at $13.3 billion as of December 31, 2023, indicating a major asset segment.",
        "Hop 2: GM Financial \u2192 Finance Charge Income: GM Financial lists finance charge income as a primary source of cash, directly tied to the performance of these receivables.",
        "Hop 3: Finance Charge Income \u2190 GM(page_64): The accounting policy on page 64 reveals that finance charge income is suspended for commercial receivables over 90 days delinquent, affecting how much of the $13.3 billion actually contributes to liquidity."

However, equity income is explicitly listed as a component of Automotive segment expenses, indicating its material role in operational performance.

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "question": "How does Nike's reduction in operating overhead expense for Global Brand Divisions align with their disclosed cost structure of primarily wage and administrative expenses?",
      "answer": "Nike reported that the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes decreased by 2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to a reduction in operating overhead expense. This decrease was driven by lower wage-related expenses, technology spend, and other administrative costs. The operating overhead expense category is explicitly defined in the filing as consisting primarily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development, and administrative costs such as rent, depreciation, and professional services. The reduction in these specific cost components aligns with the broader decline in operating overhead. At the same time, Nike noted an corresponding increase in demand creation expense, which rose to $4,285 million in fiscal 2024, up from $4,060 million in fiscal 2023. This suggests a strategic shift toward investing more in demand generation while managing wage and administrative costs downward, reflecting a deliberate cost-allocation tradeoff in their global brand strategy.",

Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net R evenues is recorded in the period in which such determ ination is m ade.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales consists prim arily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in C ost of sales.\n\n## DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE\n\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and prom otion costs, including costs of endorsem ent contracts, com plim entary products, television, digital and print advertising as well as m edia costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first tim e an advertisem ent is run. Advertising m edia costs are expensed when the advertisem ent appears. C osts related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. C osts related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is com plete and delivered.\n\nA significant am ount of the C om pany's prom otional expenses result from  paym ents under endorsem ent contracts. In general, endorsem ent paym ents are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term  of the contract. H owever, certain contracts contain elem ents that m ay be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circum stances of each individual contract. P repaym ents m ade under contracts are included in P repaid expenses and other current assets or D eferred incom e taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applies.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent paym ents to endorsers based upon specific achievem ents in their sport (e.g., winning a cham pionship). T he C om pany records D em and creation expense for these am ounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable paym ents based upon endorsers m aintaining a level of perform ance in their sport over an extended period of tim e (e.g., m aintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). W hen the C om pany determ ines paym ents are probable, the am ounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the C om pany's best estim ate of the endorser's perform ance. In these instances, to the extent actual paym ents to the endorser differ from  the C om pany's estim ate due to changes in the endorser's perform ance, adjustm ents to D em and creation expense m ay be recorded in a future period.\n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty paym ents to endorsers based upon a predeterm ined percent of sales of particular products, which the C om pany records in C ost of sales as the related sales occur. F or contracts containing m inim um  guaranteed royalty paym ents, the C om pany records the am ount of any guaranteed paym ent in excess of that earned through sales of product within D em and creation expense.\n\nThrough cooperative advertising program s, the C om pany reim burses its wholesale custom ers for certain costs of advertising the C om pany's products. T o the extent the C om pany receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the custom er that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the am ounts reim bursed are recorded in D em and creation expense.\n\nTotal D em and creation expense was $4,285 m illion, $4,060 m illion and $3,850 m illion for the years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. P repaid advertising and prom otion expenses totaled $814 m illion and $755 m illion at M ay 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which $420 m illion and $372 m illion, respectively, were recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets, and $394 m illion and $383 m illion, respectively, were recorded in D eferred incom e taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applied.\n\n## OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE\n\nOperating overhead expense consists prim arily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and developm ent costs, bad debt expense as well as other adm inistrative expenses such as rent, depreciation and am ortization, professional services, certain technology investm ents, m eetings and travel.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 64",

      "question": "Given Nike's 6% increase in demand creation expense driven by digital marketing, how does the performance of the Global Brand Divisions reflect the effectiveness of Nike's brand investment strategy given their $102 million revenue contribution?",
      "answer": "Nike's 6% increase in demand creation expense, primarily driven by higher digital marketing and advertising costs, reflects a strategic emphasis on brand promotion. This increase is directly tied to the Global Brand Divisions, which are responsible for centrally managing demand creation and digital operations. Despite this rising investment, the Global Brand Divisions generated only $102 million in revenue, a relatively small figure compared to Nike's total revenue of $46.7 billion. This suggests that while Nike is increasing its investment in brand-building activities through digital channels, the Global Brand Divisions themselves are not revenue-generating units. Instead, their role is strategic and supportive, focusing on brand development and digital infrastructure rather than direct sales. Therefore, the effectiveness of this investment must be evaluated not on immediate revenue generation but on broader brand performance metrics, such as digital engagement, customer loyalty, and indirect support to regional segments.",

This aligns with the company's disclosure that a decrease in discount rates would generally increase future pension funding requirements.

Future funding requirements generally increase if the discount rate decreases or if actual asset returns are lower than ex pected asset returns, assuming other factors are held constant. We estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. Changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions.\n\nThere are additional risks due to the complexity and magnitude of our investments. Examples include implementation of significant changes in investment policy, insufficient market liquidity in particular asset classes and the inability to quickly rebalance illiquid and long-term investments.\n\nFactors that affect future funding requirements for our U.S. defined benefit plans generally affect the required funding for non-U.S. plans. Certain plans outside the U.S. do not have assets and therefore the obligation is funded as benefits are paid. If local legal authorities increase the minimum funding requirements for our nonU.S. plans, we could be required to contribute more funds, which could negatively affect our liquidity and financial condition.\n\n## *  *  *  *  *  *  *\n\n## Item 1B.

We have implemented cybersecurity policies, procedures, technologies and controls to aid in our efforts to access, identify and manage such risks. Material risks from cybersecurity threats are managed across GM, GM Financial, Cruise, service providers such as data processors, third-party suppliers, dealers and vendors, and monitoring such risks and threats are integrated into the Company's overall risk management program.\n\nGM has a Cybersecurity Management Board that brings together representatives from senior management across the Company's Software &amp; Services, Product Development, Information Technology, Manufacturing, Finance, Communications, Human Resources, Legal and Public Policy organizations to provide guidance and monitor overall company cybersecurity risk. The Company's cybersecurity maturity scorecard, cybersecurity threats and incident information are reviewed by the Company's Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), the Risk and Cybersecurity Committee of the Company's Board of Directors and the Cybersecurity Management Board during standing meetings as well as in impromptu sessions, when appropriate. During the reviews, various topics are discussed, which may include:\n\n- implementation and maturity of the Company's cybersecurity program, risk management framework, including cybersecurity risk policies, procedures and governance;\n- cybersecurity and privacy risk, including potential impact to the Company's employees, customers, supply chain, joint ventures and other stakeholders;\n- intelligence briefings on notable cyber events impacting the industry; and\n- cybersecurity budget and resource allocation, including industry benchmarking and economic modeling of various potential cybersecurity events.\n\nThe Company maintains administrative, physical, technical and organizational safeguards, including employee training, incident response capability reviews and exercises, cybersecurity insurance and business continuity mechanisms for the protection of the Company's assets. From time to time, the Company's processes are audited and validated by internal and external experts. The Company leverages a third-party cybersecurity program with the goal of minimizing disruption to the Company's  business  and  production  operations,  strengthening  supply  chain  resilience  in  response  to  cyber-related  events  and  supporting  the  integrity  of components and systems used in its products and services.\n\n*  *  *  *  *  *  *",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial for customer and dealer financing relate to the $4.9 billion increase in collections and recoveries on finance receivables in 2021, and what does this imply about the alignment between GM Financial's liquidity strategy and GM's broader automotive sales objectives?",
      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services to customers and dealers, which directly supports vehicle sales and market penetration. GM Financial's liquidity is significantly influenced by collections and recoveries on finance receivables, which increased by $4.9 billion in 2021, indicating strong cash inflow from its loan and lease portfolio. This increase suggests that GM Financial was able to effectively manage its credit portfolio, which in turn supports its ability to fund new finance receivables and leased vehicles. This aligns with GM's strategic objective of leveraging GM Financial to enhance automotive sales, as stronger collections improve GM Financial's capacity to continue offering competitive financing solutions, reinforcing the interdependence between GM's automotive business and GM Financial's financial health.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Risk Factors, banks will no longer be persuaded or compelled to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. GM Financial established a LIBOR transition initiative in 2019 to evaluate the potential impacts of the transition, and continues to implement strategies to mitigate the risks associated with the LIBOR discontinuation such as including fallback language into any new LIBOR based contracts. GM Financial has only a limited amount of debt outstanding that  is  scheduled  to  mature  after  June  30,  2023  and  would  utilize  the Alternative  Reference  Rates  Committee  fallback  process. Furthermore, GM Financial has adhered to the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's Fallbacks Protocol and plans to transition its existing LIBOR-based derivative exposure in advance of the June 30, 2023 date when applicable LIBOR will no longer be published. For any residual exposure after the end of 2021, GM Financial expects to leverage relevant contractual and statutory solutions to transition such exposure.\n\nCritical Accounting Estimates The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires the  use  of  estimates,  judgments  and  assumptions  that  affect  the  reported  amounts  of  assets  and  liabilities,  the  disclosure  of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses in the periods  presented.  We  believe  the  accounting  estimates  employed  are  appropriate  and  the  resulting  balances  are  reasonable; however, due to the inherent uncertainties in developing estimates, actual results could differ from the original estimates, requiring adjustments  to  these  balances  in  future  periods.  Refer  to  Note  2  to  our  consolidated  financial  statements  for  our  significant accounting policies related to our critical accounting estimates.\n\nProduct Warranty and Recall Campaigns The estimates related to product warranties are established using historical information on the nature, frequency and average cost of claims of each vehicle line or each model year of the vehicle line and assumptions about future activity and events. When little or no claims experience exists for a model year or a vehicle line, the estimate is based on comparable models.\n\nWe accrue the costs related to product warranty at the time of vehicle sale and we accrue the estimated cost of recall campaigns when they are probable and estimable.",

      "question": "How did the reduction in operating overhead expense impact the financial performance of Nike's Global Brand Divisions, given the divisions' limited revenue generation as reported in the segment disclosures?",
      "answer": "Nike reported that Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes decreased by 2% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023, primarily due to lower operating overhead expense, which includes wage-related expenses, technology spend, and other administrative costs. On page 67, Nike disclosed that operating overhead expense consists of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and development costs, and other administrative expenses, indicating that cost-cutting in these areas contributed to the improvement. However, as shown in the segment disclosures on page 88, the Global Brand Divisions generated only $102 million in revenues, the smallest of any segment. This minimal revenue contribution highlights that the improved financial performance of the Global Brand Divisions was driven almost entirely by cost reductions rather than revenue growth, underscoring a reliance on expense management to offset the divisions\u2019 limited revenue-generating capacity.",

Actual returns, discounts and claim s in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus m ay differ from  estim ates recorded. If actual or expected future returns, discounts or claim s are significantly greater or lower than the reserves established, a reduction or increase to net R evenues is recorded in the period in which such determ ination is m ade.\n\n## COST OF SALES\n\nCost of sales consists prim arily of inventory costs, as well as warehousing costs (including the cost of warehouse labor), third-party royalties, certain foreign currency hedge gains and losses and product design costs. Shipping and handling costs are expensed as incurred and included in C ost of sales.\n\n## DEMAND CREATION EXPENSE\n\nDemand creation expense consists of advertising and prom otion costs, including costs of endorsem ent contracts, com plim entary products, television, digital and print advertising as well as m edia costs, brand events and retail brand presentation. Advertising production costs are expensed the first tim e an advertisem ent is run. Advertising m edia costs are expensed when the advertisem ent appears. C osts related to brand events are expensed when the event occurs. C osts related to retail brand presentation are expensed when the presentation is com plete and delivered.\n\nA significant am ount of the C om pany's prom otional expenses result from  paym ents under endorsem ent contracts. In general, endorsem ent paym ents are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term  of the contract. H owever, certain contracts contain elem ents that m ay be accounted for differently based upon the facts and circum stances of each individual contract. P repaym ents m ade under contracts are included in P repaid expenses and other current assets or D eferred incom e taxes and other assets depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applies.\n\nCertain contracts provide for contingent paym ents to endorsers based upon specific achievem ents in their sport (e.g., winning a cham pionship). T he C om pany records D em and creation expense for these am ounts when the endorser achieves the specific goal.\n\nCertain contracts provide for variable paym ents based upon endorsers m aintaining a level of perform ance in their sport over an extended period of tim e (e.g., m aintaining a specified ranking in a sport for a year). W hen the C om pany determ ines paym ents are probable, the am ounts are reported in Demand creation expense ratably over the contract period based on the C om pany's best estim ate of the endorser's perform ance. In these instances, to the extent actual paym ents to the endorser differ from  the C om pany's estim ate due to changes in the endorser's perform ance, adjustm ents to D em and creation expense m ay be recorded in a future period.\n\nCertain contracts provide for royalty paym ents to endorsers based upon a predeterm ined percent of sales of particular products, which the C om pany records in C ost of sales as the related sales occur. F or contracts containing m inim um  guaranteed royalty paym ents, the C om pany records the am ount of any guaranteed paym ent in excess of that earned through sales of product within D em and creation expense.\n\nThrough cooperative advertising program s, the C om pany reim burses its wholesale custom ers for certain costs of advertising the C om pany's products. T o the extent the C om pany receives a distinct good or service in exchange for consideration paid to the custom er that does not exceed the fair value of that good or service, the am ounts reim bursed are recorded in D em and creation expense.\n\nTotal D em and creation expense was $4,285 m illion, $4,060 m illion and $3,850 m illion for the years ended M ay 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. P repaid advertising and prom otion expenses totaled $814 m illion and $755 m illion at M ay 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, of which $420 m illion and $372 m illion, respectively, were recorded in P repaid expenses and other current assets, and $394 m illion and $383 m illion, respectively, were recorded in D eferred incom e taxes and other assets, depending on the period to which the prepaym ent applied.\n\n## OPERATING OVERHEAD EXPENSE\n\nOperating overhead expense consists prim arily of wage and benefit-related expenses, research and developm ent costs, bad debt expense as well as other adm inistrative expenses such as rent, depreciation and am ortization, professional services, certain technology investm ents, m eetings and travel.\n\n2024 FORM  10-K 64",

      "question": "How does GM's impairment of its investment in SAIC-GMAC through GM Financial relate to the residual value exposure in its leasing portfolio, and what does this imply about the financial risks associated with its joint venture strategy and vehicle depreciation assumptions?",
      "answer": "GM recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its investment in SAIC-GMAC through GM Financial due to deteriorating market conditions in China. This impairment was based on fair value estimates derived from discounted cash flow models that included assumptions about vehicle volumes and market share. Meanwhile, GM Financial disclosed a $23.5 billion estimated residual value for its leased vehicle portfolio as of December 31, 2024, with depreciation expense and potential impairment charges sensitive to changes in used vehicle prices. The residual value exposure is further detailed in a table showing that trucks and crossovers make up over 90% of residual value. The connection between these two disclosures reveals that GM's joint venture strategy in China\u2014particularly through GM Financial's stake in SAIC-GMAC\u2014is exposed to both macroeconomic risks affecting investment valuations and operational risks tied to vehicle residual value performance. If market conditions continue to deteriorate, GM could face additional impairments in its joint ventures and higher depreciation expenses from lower-than-expected residual values, compounding financial pressure.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its ex pected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1)  the  sum  of  remaining  lease  payments  plus  estimated  residual  value;  over  (2)  leased  vehicles,  net  less  deferred  revenue. Alternatively,  if  used  vehicle  prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  effect  of  a  1%  relative  change  in  the  estimated  residual  values  at  December  31,  2024,  which  could  increase  or  decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

      "answer": "The decline in GMI fleet sales as a percentage of total vehicle sales from 506,000 units (426,000 in 2022) to 401,000 units occurred alongside a significant increase in GMI's net sales and revenue, which rose from $15,420 million in 2022 to $31,070 million in 2024. This suggests that GMI's revenue growth was not driven by volume increases in fleet sales but rather by other factors such as pricing power, product mix, or expansion of services beyond fleet sales. Therefore, the revenue growth in GMI cannot be attributed to higher fleet volumes but must stem from other business dynamics within the segment.",

      "question": "How might GM's 2021 decline in fleet sales compared to 2020 relate to its increased origination of near-prime loans (FICO 620\u2013679) during the same period, and what could this imply about its broader credit risk strategy?",
      "answer": "GM reported a decrease in total fleet sales from 844 (2020) to 710 (2021), indicating a reduction in volume sales to fleet customers. Simultaneously, GM\u2019s originated near-prime loans (FICO 620\u2013679) increased from $2,388 million in 2020 to $3,856 million in 2021, suggesting a shift toward extending credit to a broader segment of retail consumers. This shift could imply a strategic move to offset declining fleet sales by expanding retail financing to near-prime borrowers. However, the increased exposure to near-prime loans, which carry higher credit risk than prime loans but less than sub-prime, may reflect a calculated risk to maintain revenue in light of reduced fleet volumes. The data from both fleet sales and loan origination trends together suggest GM may have adjusted its credit strategy to compensate for lower fleet demand, balancing growth with measured credit risk.",

      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services that support vehicle sales and dealer lending (page_24). However, GM Financial faces risks such as access to capital, loan portfolio performance, and regulatory changes, which could impair its ability to offer these services. Despite these risks, GM Financial contributed $2.7 billion in dividends to GM in 2021, which was a major driver of the increase in Net Automotive Cash from operating activities (page_41). This suggests that while GM Financial is a key enabler of GM\u2019s automotive sales strategy, its ability to continue delivering such financial contributions is contingent on its operational stability and access to capital. If GM Financial were to face disruptions, it could negatively impact both GM\u2019s automotive financing support and its cash flow contributions.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does GM's financial support for Cruise through credit and invoice deferral agreements reconcile with the significant restructuring charges Cruise recorded in 2023, particularly in light of the expected cash outflows and asset impairments tied to its autonomous vehicle operations?",
      "answer": "GM has extended financial flexibility to Cruise through a multi-year credit agreement allowing up to $3.4 billion in borrowing through 2024, of which Cruise had drawn $0.3 billion by year-end 2023. Additionally, Cruise has deferred $0.5 billion of GM-incurred engineering and capital costs under a separate framework agreement. Despite this support, Cruise recorded $529 million in restructuring charges in 2023\u2014including $212 million in supplier-related costs and $67 million in employee separation expenses\u2014following its October 2023 pause of AV operations.

      "answer": "GM adjusted its depreciation rates for leased vehicles downward in 2021 after observing that used vehicle prices at lease terminations exceeded contractual residual values. This adjustment reflects improved residual value estimates and reduces depreciation expense over the remaining lease terms. However, GM Financial remains exposed to potential declines in used vehicle prices, which could necessitate higher depreciation or impairment charges. Given that GM Financial's ability to provide competitive financing and leasing services depends on stable residual value performance, any future weakening in used vehicle prices could impair its financial services offerings and indirectly affect GM's broader sales and market penetration strategies.",

        "Hop 1: [GM](page_63) \u2192 [Depreciation Rate]: GM explains that depreciation rates for leased vehicles can be adjusted based on changes in expected residual values, with impairments or revisions reflecting market conditions.",

Realization  of  the  residual  values  is dependent  on  the  future  ability  to  market  the  vehicles  under  prevailing  market  conditions.  The  estimate  of  the  residual  value  is evaluated over the life of the arrangement and adjustments may be made to the extent the expected value of the vehicle changes. Adjustments may be in the form of revisions to the depreciation rate or recognition of an impairment charge. A lease vehicle asset group is determined to be impaired if an impairment indicator exists and the expected future cash flows, which include estimated residual values, are lower than the carrying amount of the vehicle asset group. If the carrying amount is considered impaired an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value of the vehicle asset group. Fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows, including estimated residual values. In our automotive finance operations when a leased vehicle is returned or repossessed the asset is recorded in Other assets at the lower of amortized cost or net realizable value. Upon disposition a gain or loss is recorded in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for any difference between the net book value of the leased asset and the proceeds from the disposition of the asset.\n\nEquity  Investments When  events  and  circumstances  warrant,  equity  investments  accounted  for  under  the  equity  method  of accounting are evaluated for impairment. An impairment charge is recorded whenever a decline in value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other-than-temporary. Impairment charges related to equity method investments are recorded in Equity income. Equity investments that are not accounted for under the equity method of accounting are measured at fair value or in  certain  cases  adjusted  to  fair  value  upon  an  observable  price  change,  with  changes  in  fair  value  recorded  in  Interest income and other non-operating income, net.\n\nProperty, net Property, plant and equipment, including internal use software, is recorded at cost. Major improvements that extend the useful life or add functionality are capitalized. The gross amount of assets under finance leases is included in property, plant and equipment. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. We depreciate depreciable property using the straight-line method. Leasehold improvements are amortized over the period of lease or the life of the asset, whichever is shorter. The amortization of the assets under finance leases is included in depreciation expense. Upon retirement or disposition of property, plant  and  equipment,  the  cost  and  related  accumulated  depreciation  are  eliminated  and  any  resulting  gain  or  loss  is  recorded  in earnings. Impairment charges related to property are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales, Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nSpecial Tools Special tools represent product-specific propulsion and non-propulsion related tools, dies, molds and other items used in the vehicle manufacturing process. Expenditures for special tools are recorded at cost and are capitalized. We amortize special tools over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method or an accelerated amortization method based on their historical and estimated production volume. Impairment charges related to special tools are recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nGoodwill Goodwill is not amortized but rather tested for impairment annually on October 1 and when events warrant such a review. The impairment test entails an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. If it is more likely than not that an impairment exists, then a quantitative impairment test is performed. Impairment exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value.\n\nIntangible Assets, net Intangible assets, excluding goodwill, primarily include brand names, technology and intellectual property, customer  relationships  and  dealer  networks.  Intangible  assets  are  amortized  on  a  straight-line  or  an  accelerated  method  of amortization over their estimated useful lives. An accelerated amortization method reflecting the pattern in which the asset will be consumed is utilized if that pattern can be reliably determined. We consider the period of expected cash flows and underlying data used  to  measure  the  fair  value  of  the  intangible  assets  when  selecting  a  useful  life. Amortization  of  developed  technology  and intellectual property is recorded in Automotive and other cost of sales. Amortization of brand names, customer relationships and our dealer networks is recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses. Impairment charges, if any, related to intangible assets are recorded in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense or Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nValuation of Long-Lived Assets The carrying amount of long-lived assets and finite-lived intangible assets to be held and used in the business is evaluated for impairment when events and circumstances warrant. If the carrying amount of a long-lived asset group is considered impaired, a loss is recorded based on the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds fair value. Product-specific long-lived asset groups and non-product specific long-lived assets are separately tested for impairment on an asset group basis. Fair value is determined using either the market or sales comparison approach, cost approach or anticipated",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.

Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "What does the growth in GM Financial's other income from $431 million in 2022 to $732 million in 2023 suggest about its financial performance, and how does this contrast with the subsequent $0.3 billion impairment charge recorded in 2024 related to its SAIC-GMAC investment?",
      "answer": "The increase in GM Financial's other income from $431 million in 2022 to $732 million in 2023 suggests a period of financial growth and potentially improved operational performance or investment returns within GM Financial. However, this growth contrasts sharply with the $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge recorded in 2024 related to GM Financial\u2019s SAIC-GMAC investment. This impairment indicates a significant decline in the fair value of that investment, driven by intense market competition, regulatory challenges, and declining demand in China. The juxtaposition of income growth and subsequent impairment highlights the volatility and strategic risks embedded in GM Financial\u2019s international investment portfolio, particularly in China\u2019s evolving automotive market.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSGM is a joint venture we established with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) (50%). SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How does the 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes relate to the rise in advertising and marketing expense, given that the Global Brand Divisions include centrally managed demand creation expenses?",
      "answer": "The 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes was driven by higher demand creation expenses, which include advertising and marketing costs. These rising expenses were a key contributor to the loss increase, even though the Global Brand Divisions themselves do not generate traditional revenue but instead support demand creation across geographic segments. The rise in advertising and marketing expense, as noted in the fiscal 2022 comparison, directly aligns with the increased spending under the Global Brand Divisions' demand creation strategy, highlighting how strategic investment in brand awareness can impact financial performance.",

The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. NIKE Direct revenues decreased 12% due to digital sales declines of 15% and comparable store sales declines of 14%, in part due to reduced physical retail traffic as a result of government restrictions due to COVID-19 as well as ongoing marketplace dynamics, partially offset by the addition of new stores.\n\nCurrency-neutral footwear revenues decreased 10%, driven primarily by lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of footwear decreased 7%, while lower ASP per pair reduced footwear revenues by approximately 3 percentage points, driven by lower NIKE Direct and full-price ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nCurrency-neutral apparel revenues decreased 21%, due primarily to lower revenues in Men's and Women's. Unit sales of apparel decreased 15%, while lower ASP per unit reduced apparel revenues by approximately 6 percentage points, primarily due to lower NIKE Direct and fullprice ASPs, reflecting higher discounts.\n\nReported EBIT decreased 27% due to lower revenues, gross margin contraction and higher selling and administrative expense. Gross margin decreased approximately 390 basis points, reflecting impacts from COVID-19 related government restrictions which reduced physical retail traffic and led to higher inventory obsolescence reserves recognized primarily in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. The decrease in gross margin was also largely due to higher product costs and lower NIKE Direct margins. This activity was partially offset by favorable changes in standard foreign currency exchange rates. Selling and administrative expense increased due to higher demand creation and operating overhead expense. Growth in demand creation expense was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense. Operating overhead expense increased largely due to higher wage-related costs and higher strategic technology investments.",

      "answer": "Starbucks reported that in-store operational efficiencies positively impacted the international operating margin by approximately 100 basis points (Page 43). However, store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased by 140 basis points, primarily driven by wage and benefit investments (170 basis points), deleverage (80 basis points), and increased promotional activity (70 basis points), despite being partially offset by those same in-store operational efficiencies (170 basis points) (Page 40). Financial data shows that store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues rose from 50.0% to 51.4% year-over-year (Page 42), indicating rising cost pressures despite efficiency efforts.

      "answer": "GMFinancial's U.S. Net Sales and Revenue grew from $12,133 million in 2023 to $13,575 million in 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of $1,442 million or approximately 11.9%. In contrast, the overall U.S. Automotive Net Sales grew from $116,798 million in 2022 to $127,472 million in 2023, an increase of $10,674 million or approximately 9.1%, and further to $140,536 million in 2024, an increase of $13,064 million or approximately 10.3% year-over-year. This indicates that GMFinancial's U.S. Net Sales growth outpaced the broader U.S. Automotive segment growth between 2023 and 2024, suggesting a relatively stronger performance within GM's financial services arm compared to the automotive business during this period.",

      "question": "How do Starbucks' incremental investments in partner wages and benefits in fiscal 2024 relate to the year-over-year increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, and what does this imply about the company's cost structure and strategic priorities?",
      "answer": "Starbucks reported an incremental investment of $57 million in partner wages and benefits in fiscal 2024, as disclosed in the Corporate and Other segment on page 45. This investment directly contributed to a 140 basis point increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of company-operated store revenues, with partner wages and benefits alone accounting for approximately 170 basis points of that increase, as noted on page 40. On page 42, store operating expenses rose from 45.0% to 46.2% of North America total net revenues, reflecting the broader cost pressures from these strategic investments. This suggests that Starbucks is prioritizing workforce investment to support store operations, despite the short-term margin pressure, likely to enhance service quality and employee retention.",

      "answer": "The Channel Development segment faces risks such as increased competition in packaged coffee and tea markets, supply chain cost pressures from sustainability initiatives, and shifting consumer preferences, all of which could negatively impact its profitability. Despite these risks, the goodwill balance attributed to the Channel Development segment remained unchanged at $34.7 million from fiscal year 2023 to 2024, indicating that Starbucks has not identified any impairment in the segment's long-term value. This stability in goodwill, as confirmed in the audited financial statements, suggests that Starbucks maintains confidence in the segment's ability to generate future economic benefits, even amid acknowledged market challenges.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\ncompetition from large new entrants or well-funded smaller companies, in our domestic and international markets could hinder growth and adversely affect our sales and results of operations in those markets. Many small competitors also continue to open coffee specialty stores in many of our markets across the world, which in the aggregate may also lead to significant decreases of customer traffic to our stores in those markets. Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic, or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. We believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products; successfully develop and introduce new products; price our products appropriately; deliver a satisfactory customer experience; manage our investments in store development, technology, digital engagement, and delivery; and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving certain metrics while adversely affecting others, which could have the overall effect of harming our business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to E nvironmental, Social, and Governance Matters\n\n## Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nWe recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather and water supply quality and availability. These factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. Climate change may also result in decreased availability, less favorable pricing, or other adverse consequences for non-coffee inputs in our products. In addition to impacts in producing countries, climate change may affect the availability of water in the markets in which we operate and expect to operate and elsewhere in our supply chain, which could have adverse impacts on our business. We operate in 87 markets globally. Our properties and operations may be vulnerable to the various adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause store closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers, and impact our customers and partners, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and incur additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\n\n## Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\n\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of regulators and organizations, including the SEC, the European Union, the Nasdaq Stock Market, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress and state legislatures, which in certain cases may be inconsistent with one another, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, regulators, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social, and governance (commonly referred to as 'ESG') matters and related disclosures and operational regulations. These changing rules, regulations, and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative ex penses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult, and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC's climate-related reporting requirements and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD'), with different implementation dates depending on company size and geographic location, has established extensive ESG-related disclosure requirements based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, including certain assurance obligations. The standards used to identify and collect the information and data required pursuant to the CSRD are still developing and uncertain, and this lack of certainty could result in increased costs related to complying with our reporting obligations under the CSRD and could increase the risk of failing to comply with the CSRD.\n\nWe may also communicate certain initiatives and goals related to environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing, social investments, and other ESG-related matters in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and ex pensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Starbucks Corporation\n\n## Opinion on the Financial Statements\n\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Starbucks Corporation and subsidiaries (the 'Company') as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the 'financial statements'). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "question": "How does GMNA's significant revenue growth from 2022 to 2023 align with the 'Other Variance' component of $0.7 billion in explaining the total $13.067 billion revenue increase, and how does this compare to the overall variance explanation for GM's total net sales and revenue?",
      "answer": "GMNA's revenue increased from $128.378 billion in 2022 to $141.445 billion in 2023, a growth of $13.067 billion. Of this increase, $0.7 billion is attributed to 'Other Variance', indicating that while most of the growth came from volume ($8.5 billion) and price ($3.2 billion), a small portion remains unallocated or attributed to other factors. This mirrors the overall net sales and revenue increase of $15.108 billion for GM, where $1.8 billion is attributed to 'Other Variance', suggesting that unallocated factors consistently influence both the segment and company-wide revenue changes.",

      "question": "What implications does GM's inclusion of SG&A people-related costs in Automotive segment expenses have for interpreting their EBIT-adjusted performance metric, which excludes automotive interest and tax expenses but does not adjust for these operational costs?",
      "answer": "GM reports that Automotive segment expenses include 'selling, general and administrative people-related costs' as a core component of operational spending (page 104). However, the company uses EBIT-adjusted as its primary performance metric for evaluating Automotive segment results, which excludes automotive interest income/expense and income taxes but does not adjust for SG&A people-related costs (page 46). This creates a situation where a significant operational expense category remains in the performance metric, even as other financial components are excluded. This suggests EBIT-adjusted may not fully reflect the operational cost structure the company emphasizes in its segment reporting, potentially complicating comparisons between segments or against historical performance.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "answer": "GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment due to the challenging market conditions affecting GM's China joint ventures. This impairment was based on fair value measurements using a discounted cash flow model with a 13.0% discount rate, 3.5% long-term growth rate, and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share. Meanwhile, GM Financial's Other income increased from $435 million in 2022 to $754 million in 2023, representing a 73% year-over-year increase.

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "The $102 million in 'Other' revenues reported under Global Brand Divisions represents just 0.2% of Nike\u2019s total revenues of $46,710 million in fiscal 2022, indicating a relatively minor contribution to overall financial performance. According to the company, these revenues include NIKE Brand licensing and other miscellaneous revenues that are not part of a geographic operating segment, as defined on page 35. The Global Brand Divisions, which centrally manage these revenues, also reported a loss before interest and taxes that increased by 17% in fiscal 2022, driven by higher demand creation and operating overhead expenses. This suggests that while 'Other' revenues are a small, non-core component of Nike\u2019s revenue structure, the associated costs and strategic investments in digital capabilities and technology may have a broader financial impact on the company's profitability.",

        "Hop 1: NKE(page_88) \u2192 Global Brand Divisions: The Global Brand Divisions are shown to generate $102 million in 'Other' revenues, a small portion of Nike's total revenues of $46.71 billion in fiscal 2022.",

Higher operating overhead expense was primarily due to an increase in strategic technology investments, continued investment in digital capabilities and higher wage-related expenses. Higher demand creation expense was primarily due to higher advertising and marketing expense and higher sports marketing costs.\n\n## CONVERSE\n\n",

Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to fiscal 2022 presentation. These changes had no impact on previously reported consolidated results of operations or shareholders' equity. For additional information about the Consumer Direct Acceleration refer to Item 7.

      "answer": "The $8.5 billion favorable volume variance for GMNA in 2023 aligns with the increase in GMNA fleet sales from 564,000 units in 2022 to 679,000 units in 2023, indicating that the growth in fleet sales was a significant contributor to the revenue increase. This favorable volume variance was the largest component of GMNA\u2019s $13.067 billion revenue growth year-over-year, suggesting that fleet sales expansion played a central role in GMNA's improved financial performance. The quantitative link between unit volume growth and revenue variance underscores the strategic importance of fleet sales in driving top-line results for GM.",

        "Hop 1: GM(page_33) \u2192 Volume Variance: GM reports a $8.5 billion favorable volume variance for GMNA in 2023, contributing to a total revenue increase of $13.067 billion for the segment.",
        "Hop 2: Volume Variance \u2192 GMNA: The volume variance is directly tied to GMNA's performance, indicating that increased unit sales were a primary driver of the segment's revenue growth.",

      "answer": "Amazon reported that increased unit sales, including from third-party sellers and advertising, were a primary driver of the 18% North America sales growth in 2021. However, despite this growth, North America operating income decreased due to fulfillment network inefficiencies, increased shipping and wage costs, and supply chain constraints. This indicates that while higher unit sales positively contributed to revenue, the associated operational challenges and cost increases offset those benefits at the operating income level, revealing a tension between top-line growth and bottom-line performance.",

      "question": "Given Tesla's automotive segment's increasing reliance on automotive regulatory credits as a revenue source in 2021, how does the warranty reserve exposure tied to the automotive segment affect the financial sustainability of this revenue model?",
      "answer": "Tesla reported $1.465 billion in automotive regulatory credits in 2021, which is part of the broader automotive segment revenue totaling $51.034 billion. This segment includes not only vehicle sales but also regulatory credits and aftersales services. However, the automotive segment also carries significant warranty obligations, with warranty reserves primarily tied to vehicles sold. The warranty reserve is based on projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties, and due to the scale of Tesla's automotive business, this reserve is substantial. While regulatory credits provide a non-operational revenue stream that supports financial performance, the long-term sustainability of this model depends on Tesla's ability to manage the cost of warranty claims, which are expensed as incurred for leased vehicles and could offset gains from regulatory credit sales.",

We accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "Given the Channel Development segment's role in strategic partnerships and consumer packaged goods, and the fact that its goodwill balance remained unchanged at $34.7 million throughout the 2020\u20132022 fiscal years while other segments saw significant goodwill fluctuations, how does this stability reflect the company's strategic positioning of the Channel Development business relative to its North America and International segments?",
      "answer": "The Channel Development segment's goodwill remained constant at $34.7 million from fiscal 2020 to 2022, indicating no major acquisitions or impairments during this period. This contrasts sharply with the North America and International segments, which experienced both increases and significant write-downs in goodwill (e.g., a $391.6 million reduction in the International segment in 2022). The stability in Channel Development's goodwill, combined with its strategic focus on long-term partnerships like those with Nestl\u00e9 and PepsiCo, suggests that this segment is being managed with a consistent, asset-light model that relies less on acquisition-driven growth and more on licensing and brand extension\u2014aligning with its role in distributing Starbucks-branded products globally without the same capital intensity as retail operations.",

      "question": "How does GM's quantitative disclosure of the $1.8 billion allowance for loan losses on GM Financial's retail receivables as of December 31, 2021, relate to the qualitative risk discussion around GM Financial's dependence on access to capital and its impact on GM's ability to support vehicle sales through financing?",
      "answer": "GM reports a $1.8 billion allowance for loan losses on GM Financial's retail finance receivables as of December 31, 2021, reflecting expected credit losses over the remaining life of the portfolio. This allowance is sensitive to economic forecasts and recovery rates, with a 5% decrease in recovery rates potentially increasing the allowance by $0.1 billion. The allowance is based on a range of economic scenarios, resulting in an estimated range of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Meanwhile, the risk factors section emphasizes that GM relies on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and dealers, and any impairment in GM Financial's access to capital or performance of its loan portfolio could reduce its ability to support GM's vehicle sales.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services to support vehicle sales, and this relationship is at risk if GM Financial faces constraints due to interest rate fluctuations or credit quality issues. GM Financial's fixed-rate retail finance receivables expose it to interest rate risk, as rising rates could reduce net interest income, especially since GM Financial was liability-sensitive in 2021. At the same time, the credit quality of these receivables is under pressure, with $602 million in suspended finance charge income due to delinquencies at the end of 2021. This suggests that GM's automotive sales strategy, which relies on accessible financing through GM Financial, could be impacted both by macroeconomic conditions affecting interest rates and by consumer credit behavior affecting delinquency rates. The dual exposure highlights a vulnerability in GM\u2019s sales model if either of these risks escalates.",

Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines. The following table presents GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity to interest rate movement:\n\n",

      "answer": "Starbucks reports a goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million as of September 29, 2024, allocated to the international segment, which includes the China reporting unit. This unit undergoes annual impairment testing due to its materiality and exposure to market-specific risks, such as economic conditions and consumer behavior in China. In contrast, the Corporate and Other segment has a minimal goodwill allocation of $1.0 million, indicating limited strategic weight or operational scale compared to the international segment. The disparity in goodwill allocation suggests that the China reporting unit plays a far more central role in Starbucks' global operations and long-term growth strategy, while the Corporate and Other segment has a more peripheral function, with correspondingly lower risk exposure.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

GM Financial assigns risk ratings to dealers using proprietary models and conducts periodic credit reviews. As of December 31, 2020, commercial finance receivables from the 2020 origination year totaled $512 million, representing 5.9% of the total portfolio. While there were no receivables on nonaccrual status in 2021 and only an insignificant amount in 2020, the performance of these receivables is critical to GM Financial\u2019s ability to continue offering competitive financing. If the credit quality of these receivables were to deteriorate, particularly for recent originations like those in 2020, GM Financial could face increased capital constraints or reduced liquidity, which would in turn limit its capacity to support dealer financing.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "Given GM North America's $16.064 billion increase in net sales and revenue from 2023 to 2024, how does the company's strategic investment in EV manufacturing capacity, including Factory ZERO and CAMI Assembly, align with the volume-driven growth of $12.8 billion attributed to GM North America during this period?",
      "answer": "GM North America reported a $16.064 billion increase in net sales and revenue from 2023 to 2024, with $12.8 billion of that growth attributed to volume increases. This aligns with the company\u2019s strategic investments in EV manufacturing capacity, as outlined in the Business section. Specifically, GM expanded production capabilities at Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center, which now produces multiple EV models including the GMC HUMMER EV and Chevrolet Silverado EV, and at CAMI Assembly in Canada, which became the country\u2019s first full-scale EV manufacturing facility. These investments directly support the increased production volume needed to meet growing demand, as reflected in the financial performance of GM North America. The connection between volume growth and EV capacity expansion underscores a strategic alignment between operational investments and financial outcomes in the North American market.",

Business\n\nGeneral Motors Company (sometimes referred to as we, our, us, ourselves, the Company, G eneral Motors or GM) was incorporated as a Delaware corporation in 2009. We design, build and sell trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts and provide software-enabled services and subscriptions worldwide. Our automotive operations meet the demands of our customers through our automotive segments: GM North America (GMNA) and GM International (GMI) with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily in China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Baojun, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and Wuling brands. Cruise is our global segment responsible for the development of autonomous vehicle (AV ) technology. We provide automotive financing services through our General Motors Financial Company, Inc. (GM Financial) segment. Refer to Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&amp;A) and Note 23 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information about our segments. Except for per share amounts or as otherwise specified, amounts presented within tables are stated in millions. Certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding. Forward-looking statements in this Business section are not guarantees of future performance and may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected. Refer to Item 1A. Risk Factors and the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section of Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A for a discussion of these risks and uncertainties.\n\nOur vision for the future is a world with zero crashes, zero emissions and zero congestion, which guides our growth-focused strategy to invest in electric vehicles (EVs)  and  AV s,  software-enabled  services  and  subscriptions  and  new  business  opportunities,  while  strengthening  our  market  position  in  profitable  internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, such as trucks and sport utility vehicles (SUVs).\n\nElectric Vehicles We are offering customers choice with our diverse EV  lineup. A key element in our EV  strategy is our dedicated EV  propulsion architecture. Our current-generation, flexible EV  platform is being deployed across multiple brands and vehicle sizes, styles and drive configurations, leveraging our technology to expand our EV portfolio over a wide and growing variety of segments and price points. With our next-generation battery technology, we intend to expand to multiple chemistries, multiple form factors and multiple cell suppliers as we continue to deliver even more EV choices for our customers.\n\nTo support our expanding portfolio of EV s, we have made significant investments in our plants across North America. GM's Factory ZERO Detroit-Hamtramck Assembly Center is a fully dedicated EV  facility which produces a variety of vehicles, including the GMC HUMMER EV  Pickup and SUV , the Chevrolet Silverado EV and the recently launched Cadillac ESCALADE IQ, with globally sourced parts. GM's CAMI Assembly is Canada's first full-scale EV  manufacturing facility. We plan to convert Orion Assembly in Orion Township, Michigan to build electric pickups, with the plant slated to begin production in 2026. GM is also investing in our propulsion, stamping and components plants to support EV production. We are mass-producing battery cells for these and other future EV s through Ultium Cells Holdings LLC (an equally owned joint venture with LG  Energy Solution) in plants in Warren, Ohio and Spring Hill, Tennessee, with plans to expand our battery cell manufacturing footprint, including in Indiana through a joint venture with Samsung SDI.\n\nGM's all-electric future is guided by customer choice and focused on delivering a world-class portfolio of EV s and an ecosystem to support them, while maintaining a compelling lineup of gas-powered vehicles. GM EV  drivers have access to more than 231,000 chargers across North America. This includes access to more than 20,000  Tesla  Superchargers  with  the  use  of  a  G M-approved  North American  Charging  Standard  adapter.  In  2024,  GM  also  announced  that  it  will  enhance  its collaboration with EV go to build 2,850 DC fast charging stalls, including 400 fast chargers at flagship destinations in major metropolitan areas across the U.S. GM is also a founding member of IONNA, a joint venture with seven other automakers aiming to create a high-powered charging network with a targeted installation of at least 30,000 chargers in urban and highway locations throughout North America. The joint venture broke ground on its first charging station in October 2024.\n\nSoftware-Enabled Services and Subscriptions Our vehicles are equipped with a suite of software-enabled services, including OnStar services, Super Cruise and others. With nearly three decades of experience, OnStar is a global leader in enabling automotive services. OnStar is currently available in 20 markets globally and growing. As  GM  introduces  more  software-defined  vehicles,  OnStar  is  playing  a  key  role  as  an  enabler  of  active  safety,  infotainment,  connectivity  and  driver assistance features. OnStar provides one ecosystem for retail and fleet customers to use, engage and shop through a broader set of service offerings available at and after vehicle purchase.

      "question": "How does GMI's contribution to total fleet sales volume of 506 thousand units in 2023 relate to its $1.2 billion price variance, given the segment's relatively modest 3.4% revenue growth compared to the overall automotive business?",
      "answer": "GMI contributed 506 thousand units to total fleet sales in 2023, representing a significant portion of GM's international fleet business. Despite only a 3.4% revenue increase for the GMI segment, the $1.2 billion favorable price variance indicates that pricing adjustments played a substantial role in the segment's performance. This is notable because GMI's price variance of $1.2 billion represented a larger absolute contribution from pricing than GMNA's $3.2 billion price variance when considering GMNA's much larger revenue base of $141.4 billion compared to GMI's $15.9 billion. The relatively modest revenue growth percentage combined with a significant price variance suggests that while pricing had a meaningful impact, other factors like volume and mix constrained overall growth in the international market segment.",

In a separate section, the company disclosed $1.6 billion in restructuring and transformation-related charges specifically within the GMNA segment, indicating strategic efforts to reposition the business amid declining fleet sales.

      "answer": "Tesla's Automotive Segment, which includes electric vehicle sales and services, saw a 17% year-over-year revenue increase in 2023, reaching $82.4 billion. This segment explicitly includes the sale of automotive regulatory credits, which only grew by 1% from $1.776 billion in 2022 to $1.790 billion in 2023. This suggests that the majority of the automotive segment's growth came from vehicle sales and leasing rather than regulatory credits.

      "answer": "GM's strategic dependence on GM Financial for customer and dealer financing, as outlined in the risk factors section, is closely tied to GM Financial's ability to maintain adequate allowance levels for potential loan losses. GM Financial uses a static pool modeling technique, incorporating economic forecasts such as unemployment rates and GDP growth, to estimate expected credit losses over the life of its receivables. The data from 2020 to 2021 shows a decrease in the total allowance for loan losses from $1,978 million to $1,886 million, despite an increase in total GM Financial receivables from $59,970 million to $64,702 million. This suggests that while the overall loan portfolio grew, the estimated risk of default, as modeled by GM Financial and informed by macroeconomic conditions, slightly improved or was adjusted downward. This alignment between GM's strategic financing model and the quantitative risk provisioning indicates a calculated approach to credit risk management amid economic uncertainty.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Various  factors,  including turnover of holdings and investment guidelines, are considered in determining the classification of securities. Available-for-sale debt securities  are  recorded  at  fair  value  with  non-credit  related  unrealized  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  Accumulated  other comprehensive loss until realized. Credit losses are recorded in Interest income and other non-operating income, net. An evaluation is made quarterly to determine if any portion of unrealized losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss needs to be reclassified. Non-credit related unrealized losses are reclassified to Interest income and other non-operating income, net if we intend to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before the recovery of the unrealized loss.\n\nWe determine realized gains and losses for all debt securities using the specific identification method and measure the fair value of our marketable debt securities using a market approach where identical or comparable prices are available and an income approach in other cases. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values of securities are determined using prices from a pricing service, pricing models, quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics or discounted cash flow models. These prices represent nonbinding quotes. Our pricing service utilizes industry-standard pricing models that consider various inputs. We typically review our pricing service quarterly and believe the prices received from our pricing service are a reliable representation of exit prices.\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable Accounts and notes receivable primarily consists of amounts that are due and payable from our customers for the sale of vehicles, parts, and accessories. We evaluate the collectability of receivables each reporting period and record an allowance for doubtful accounts to present the net amount expected to be collected on our receivables. Additions to the allowance are charged to bad debt expense reported in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense and were insignificant in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n\nGM Financial Receivables Finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered adequate to cover  expected  credit  losses  on  the  finance  receivables.  For  retail  finance  receivables,  GM  Financial  uses  static  pool  modeling techniques to determine the allowance for loan losses expected over the remaining life of the receivables, which is supplemented by management judgment. The modeling techniques incorporate reasonable and supportable forecasts of economic conditions over the expected  remaining  life  of  the  finance  receivables.  The  economic  forecasts  incorporate  factors  which  vary  by  region  that  GM Financial believes will have the largest impact on expected losses, including unemployment rates, interest rate spreads, disposable personal income and growth rates in gross domestic product.\n\nTroubled debt restructurings (TDRs) are grouped separately for purposes of measuring the allowance. The allowance for TDRs uses static pool modeling techniques like non-TDR retail finance receivables to determine the expected loss amount. The expected cash  flows  of  the  receivables  are  then  discounted  at  the  original  weighted  average  effective  interest  rate  of  the  pool.  Factors considered when estimating the allowance for TDRs are based on an evaluation of historical and current information, which may be supplemented by management judgment. Finance charge income from loans classified as TDRs is accounted for in the same manner as other accruing loans. Cash collections on these loans are allocated according to the same payment hierarchy methodology applied to loans that are not classified as TDRs.\n\nCommercial finance receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance for loan losses and amounts held under a cash management program. GM Financial establishes the allowance for loan losses based on historical loss experience, as well as the forecast for industry vehicle sales, which is the economic indicator believed to have the largest impact on expected losses.\n\nInventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less cost to sell, and considers general market and economic conditions, periodic reviews of current profitability of vehicles, product warranty costs and the effect of estimated sales incentives. Net realizable value for off-lease and other vehicles is current auction sales proceeds less disposal and warranty costs. Productive material, supplies, work in process and service parts are reviewed to determine if inventory quantities are in excess of forecasted usage or if they have become obsolete.\n\nEquipment on Operating Leases Equipment on operating leases, net primarily consists of vehicle leases to retail customers with lease terms of two to five years. We are exposed to changes in the residual values of these assets. The residual values represent estimates of the values of the leased vehicles at the end of the lease agreements and are determined based on",

      "answer": "GM's 2023 financial tables specifically call out a $0.4 billion unfavorable 'Other Variance' impact on GMI segment revenue when comparing 2023 to 2022 results. This negative variance occurred despite GMI's fleet sales volume showing consistent growth over the three-year period from 2021 (311,000 units) to 2022 (426,000 units) and reaching 506,000 units in 2023. The variance suggests that while fleet sales volume was increasing, other financial factors specifically affecting the GMI segment - such as pricing dynamics, cost elements, or mix factors not captured in the volume metrics - had a negative impact on revenue growth in 2023. This contrast highlights that volume growth alone doesn't necessarily translate to proportionate revenue growth when other financial variables negatively offset the volume gains.",

      "answer": "The growth in advertising sales, mentioned on page 24, helped offset rising shipping and fulfillment costs in 2021, both in North America and internationally. This advertising growth is explicitly tied to the 22% increase in international sales in 2021, as noted on page 23, which was driven by unit sales, third-party seller activity, and advertising. The fact that advertising sales played a role in both cost mitigation and international revenue growth suggests that Amazon is leveraging its advertising platform as a strategic lever in international markets\u2014using it not only to diversify revenue streams but also to support broader expansion efforts despite fulfillment challenges and foreign exchange headwinds of $3.0 billion in 2021.",

      "question": "How does GM's provision of up to $3.4 billion in credit and $0.8 billion in invoice deferrals to Cruise through GM Financial influence the accounting treatment of equity-based compensation tied to Cruise's common stock?",
      "answer": "GM provides Cruise with significant financial support through GM Financial, including a multi-year credit agreement allowing up to $3.4 billion in borrowings to fund AV purchases and related equipment, as well as a framework agreement deferring up to $0.8 billion in engineering and capital spending invoices through June 2028. As of December 31, 2023, Cruise had drawn $0.3 billion under the credit agreement and deferred $0.5 billion under the invoice deferral program. These financial arrangements indicate a strong financial linkage and strategic dependency between GM and Cruise. This support appears to influence how GM accounts for equity-based compensation tied to Cruise. Specifically, GM modifies RSUs that settle in Cruise stock to remove liquidity vesting conditions, and compensation costs for such awards are based on the fair value of Cruise\u2019s common stock at the end of each reporting period until the stock has been issued for more than six months. This accounting treatment reflects the ongoing financial interdependence and strategic alignment between GM and Cruise, with financial support from GM Financial potentially stabilizing Cruise\u2019s operations and valuation, which in turn affects how GM values and expenses equity compensation linked to Cruise\u2019s equity.",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial for customer and dealer financing relate to the reported decline in GM Financial's net interest income sensitivity between 2020 and 2021, and what implications does this have for GM's exposure to interest rate fluctuations?",
      "answer": "GM relies on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to dealers, which directly supports vehicle sales and market penetration. In 2021, GM Financial became liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within twelve months, leading to a decrease in net interest income during rising rate environments. This sensitivity had decreased from 2020, when GM Financial was asset-sensitive, implying that rising rates would have increased net interest income. Given GM's dependence on GM Financial's financial services, this shift in interest rate sensitivity increases GM's operational risk during periods of rising interest rates, as GM Financial\u2019s ability to provide competitive financing could be constrained, indirectly affecting GM\u2019s sales and financing support capabilities.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

      "answer": "GM Financial experienced an increase in finance charge income from $4.5 billion in 2022 to $6.2 billion in 2023, indicating strong performance in its financial services segment. However, in 2024, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment due to deteriorating market conditions in China, including excess capacity and regulatory pressures. This suggests that while the core financial services business grew, specific external risks tied to joint ventures in China negatively impacted asset valuations, highlighting a divergence between operational performance and investment risk exposure.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "Given GM Financial's role in originating commercial finance receivables totaling $8,682 million as of December 31, 2020, how does GM's risk disclosure regarding GM Financial's dependence on competitive financing sources and regulatory changes reconcile with the high concentration of these receivables originated in recent years (e.g., 90.5% from 2020 and prior)?",
      "answer": "GM's consolidated financial statements (page 71) show that as of December 31, 2020, $8,682 million of commercial finance receivables were originated in recent years, with 90.5% coming from 2020 or earlier. These receivables are managed by GM Financial, which uses proprietary risk models to assess dealer creditworthiness. However, in the risk factors section (page 24), GM highlights that GM Financial's ability to provide competitive financing depends on access to capital markets, regulatory environments, and the performance of its loan portfolio. The high concentration of receivables from recent origination years suggests a significant exposure to economic or regulatory shifts that could affect dealer repayment capacity. This aligns with the risk disclosure that GM Financial's operations could be impaired by disruptions in financing sources or adverse regulatory developments, which would directly impact the value and performance of these concentrated receivables. Thus, the quantitative concentration risk in the financial statements is amplified by the qualitative risks outlined in the risk factors section, creating a compounded exposure for GM.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on finance charge income from GM Financial, as detailed in the Automotive Financing section, relate to the impairment charges recorded by GM Financial on its SAIC-GMAC investment amid the restructuring of GM's China joint ventures?",
      "answer": "GM recognizes finance charge income from GM Financial using the effective interest method, indicating a strong financial linkage between GM and GM Financial, particularly through automotive financing operations. GM Financial's liquidity is significantly influenced by this income stream, as it relies on finance charge income as a primary source of cash. However, amid the restructuring of GM's China joint ventures and intense market competition, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment, which is a subsidiary tied to the Chinese market. This impairment reflects the deteriorating financial outlook of the investment and signals a negative financial impact on GM Financial, despite its core reliance on stable finance charge income. Thus, while GM Financial is a key contributor to GM\u2019s revenue through finance charge income, it is also exposed to significant risks in its international investments, particularly in China, which can undermine its financial stability.",

Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of the transaction price.\n\nTypically,  transfers  to  daily  rental  companies  are  accounted  for  as  sales,  with  revenue  recognized  at  the  time  of  transfer.  We  defer  revenue  for  remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a liability for amounts ex pected to be paid once the remarketing services are complete at the time of sale and recognize deferred revenue in earnings upon completion of the remarketing service.\n\nUsed Vehicles Proceeds from the auction of vehicles utilized by our employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nServices and Other Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-sale services such as maintenance, OnStar, Super Cruise, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service arrangements that are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and recognized as deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services sold separately as services are performed, typically over a period of up to eight years.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial Finance  charge  income  earned  on  finance  receivables  is  recognized  using  the  effective  interest  method.  Fees  and commissions received (including manufacturer subvention) and direct costs of originating loans are deferred and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 60 days delinquent, accounts in bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has received payments bringing the delinquency to less than 60 days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 90 days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest.  Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received payments bringing the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including amounts previously charged off).\n\nIncome from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. G ains or losses realized upon disposition of off-lease assets including any payments received from lessees upon lease termination, are included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nAdvertising and Promotion E xpenditures Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $3.3 billion, $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nResearch and Development E xpenditures Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other cost of sales, were $9.2 billion, $9.9 billion and $9.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. These ex penditures include cost sharing payments and fees we receive when we enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design and development activities and use of intellectual property.\n\nCash  E quivalents  and  Restricted  Cash Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of 90 days or less.  Certain operating agreements require us to post cash as collateral. Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral. Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "GM reported a total consolidated net sales and revenue increase from $171,842 million in 2023 to $187,442 million in 2024, driven by growth in both GMNA and GMFinancial segments. However, the eliminations/reclassifications line item decreased significantly from $(151) million in 2023 to $(296) million in 2024, indicating a larger negative adjustment to consolidated revenue. This trend is further emphasized in the cost of sales section, where eliminations continued to have a negative impact, decreasing from $(12) million in 2023 to $(3) million in 2024, suggesting a compounding effect on margin pressures. This raises the question of how much of the reported revenue growth is offset by internal adjustments and what this implies for the underlying profitability and operational efficiency of GM's business segments.",

      "answer": "The $62.2 billion in AWS sales for 2021 reflects a significant volume-driven expansion, as the 37% year-over-year growth is primarily attributed to increased customer usage. However, this growth occurred alongside pricing reductions that partially offset the revenue gains from higher usage. The financial results from page 24 indicate that AWS operating income growth was driven by both increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, suggesting that while pricing was reduced, operational efficiencies helped maintain profitability. This balance shows that AWS prioritized market expansion through competitive pricing while still managing to grow its operating income, indicating a strategic trade-off between revenue per unit and volume to sustain long-term cloud market leadership.",

We believe that operating income (loss) is a more meaningful measure than gross profit and gross margin due to the diversity of our product categories and services.\n\nThe decrease in North America operating income in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased wage rates and incentives, increased carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies, and growth in certain operating expenses, including marketing, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income by $8 million and $88 million for 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe International operating loss in 2021, as compared to the operating income in the prior year, is primarily due to increased shipping and fulfillment costs, due in part to increased investments in our fulfillment network, increased wage rates and incentives, and increased carrier rates, and growth in certain operating expenses, including marketing, partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales. Changes in foreign exchange rates impacted operating income (loss) by $411 million and $435 million for 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe increase in AWS operating income in absolute dollars in 2021, compared to the prior year, is primarily due to increased customer usage and cost structure productivity, partially offset by increased spending on technology infrastructure and payroll and related expenses, all of which were primarily driven by additional investments to support the business growth, and reduced prices for our customers.

In a rising interest rate environment, this would cause the interest paid on liabilities to increase more rapidly than interest earned on assets, initially decreasing net interest income. Since GM relies on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to dealers, a decline in GM Financial's financial performance could impair its ability to offer competitive financing options.

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does Starbucks' increased investment in store partner wages and benefits, which contributed to a 140 basis point increase in store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues, reconcile with the company's claim that in-store operational efficiencies partially offset these costs, particularly in light of the 100 basis point improvement in international operating margin attributed to those same efficiencies?",
      "answer": "Starbucks reported that store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues increased by 140 basis points, with approximately 170 basis points attributed to investments in store partner wages and benefits. However, the company also noted that in-store operational efficiencies offset this increase by approximately 170 basis points. This dynamic is further reflected in the international segment, where increased promotional activity and wage investments led to a 220 basis point contraction in operating margin, but in-store efficiencies contributed a 100 basis point improvement. This suggests that while wage investments placed upward pressure on operating expenses, operational improvements helped mitigate the impact, particularly in international markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Deferred Revenues\n\nOur deferred revenue primarily consists of the up-front prepaid royalty from Nestl\u00e9, for which we have continuing performance obligations to support the Global Coffee Alliance, and our unredeemed stored value card liability and unredeemed Stars associated with our loyalty program. See Note 11, Deferred Revenue, for further information.\n\n## Disaggregation of Revenues\n\nRevenues disaggregated by segment, product type, and geographic area are disclosed in Note 17, Segment Reporting.\n\n## Product and Distribution Costs\n\nProduct and distribution costs primarily include expenses related to raw materials, purchased goods, packaging, and delivery, along with operational costs of our supply chain organization. This encompasses wages, benefits, occupancy costs, and depreciation associated with sourcing, procuring, manufacturing, warehousing, and transportation of products sold at our company-operated and licensed stores, as well as through Channel Development and our other businesses. Additionally, it includes costs related to inventory and supply chain asset impairments.\n\n## Store Operating Expenses\n\nStore operating expenses consist of costs incurred in our company-operated stores, primarily wages and benefits related to store partners (employees), occupancy costs, delivery commissions, and other costs that directly support the operation and sales-related activities of those stores.\n\n## General and Administrative Expenses\n\nGeneral and administrative expenses primarily consist of wages and benefits, professional service fees, and occupancy costs for corporate headquarters and regional offices that support our corporate functions.\n\n## Advertising\n\nWe expense most advertising costs as they are incurred, except for certain production costs that are expensed the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expenses totaled $597.3 million, $507.8 million, and $416.7 million in fiscal 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Store Preopening Expenses\n\nCosts incurred in connection with the start-up and promotion of new company-operated store openings are expensed as incurred.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations\n\nWe recognize a liability for the fair value of required asset retirement obligations ('ARO') when such obligations are incurred. Our AROs are primarily associated with leasehold improvements, which, at the end of a lease, we are contractually obligated to remove to comply with the lease agreement. At the inception of a lease with such conditions, we record an ARO liability and a corresponding capital asset in an amount equal to the estimated fair value of the obligation. We estimate the liability using a number of assumptions, including store closing costs, cost inflation rates, and discount rates, and accrete the liability to its projected future value over time. The capitalized asset is depreciated using the same depreciation convention as leasehold improvement assets. Upon satisfaction of the ARO conditions, any difference between the recorded ARO liability and the actual retirement costs incurred is recognized as a gain or loss in store operating expenses on our consolidated statements of earnings. As of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, our net ARO assets included in property, plant and equipment were $25.1 million and $25.6 million, respectively, and our net ARO liabilities included in other long-term liabilities were $119.2 million and $110.3 million, respectively.\n\n## Stock-based Compensation\n\nWe maintain several equity incentive plans under which we may grant non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units ('RSUs'), or stock appreciation rights to employees, non-employee directors, and consultants; stock options have not been broadly used as part of our compensation strategy in recent years. We also have an employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP'). RSUs issued by us are equivalent to nonvested shares under the applicable accounting guidance. We record stock-based compensation expense based on the fair value of stock awards at the grant date and recognize the expense over the related service period following a graded vesting expense schedule. Expense for performance-based RSUs is recognized when it is probable the performance goal will be achieved. Performance goals are determined by the Board and may include measures such as earnings per share, operating income, return on invested capital, total shareholder return, and metrics focused on talent and sustainability. The fair value of RSUs is based on the closing price of Starbucks common stock on the award date, less the present value of the dividends expected to be paid on the underlying shares during the vesting period. The fair value of each stock option granted is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation",

      "answer": "Starbucks highlights in its risk factors that the Channel Development segment faces competitive pressures from new entrants and established players in the packaged coffee and ready-to-drink beverage markets, which could adversely affect its profitability. Despite these risks, the goodwill balance for the Channel Development segment remained unchanged at $34.7 million from fiscal years 2023 to 2024, indicating no impairment was recognized during this period. This stability suggests that the segment's fair value, as assessed through impairment testing, remained above its carrying value, even amid competitive headwinds. In contrast, the China reporting unit within the International segment holds a significantly larger goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million as of September 29, 2024, and it underwent annual impairment testing that confirmed its fair value exceeded its carrying value. The audit report affirms the accuracy of these disclosures and supports the conclusion that no impairment charges were necessary for the China reporting unit. Together, these elements imply that while the Channel Development segment faces material risks, its financial performance and valuation remain stable enough to avoid impairment, similar to the China reporting unit, despite differing scales of goodwill exposure.",

Increased competition globally in packaged coffee and tea and single-serve and ready-to-drink coffee beverage markets, including from new and large entrants to this market, could adversely affect the profitability of the Channel Development segment. In addition, not all of our competitors may seek to establish environmental or sustainability goals at a comparable level to ours, which could result in lower supply chain or operating costs for our competitors. We may incur increased costs associated with reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions, reducing the use of plastic, or imposing performance obligations on our suppliers that could increase financial obligations for us and our business partners and could affect our profitability. Additionally, if we are unable to respond to consumer demand for healthy beverages and foods, or our competitors respond more effectively, this could have a negative effect on our business. We believe our ability to compete successfully in the current market environment depends on our ability to improve existing products; successfully develop and introduce new products; price our products appropriately; deliver a satisfactory customer experience; manage our investments in store development, technology, digital engagement, and delivery; and respond effectively to our competitors' actions or offerings or to unforeseen disruptive actions. There can be no assurance these strategies will be effective, and some strategies may be effective at improving certain metrics while adversely affecting others, which could have the overall effect of harming our business. Furthermore, declines in general consumer demand for specialty coffee products for any reason, including due to consumer preference for other products, flattening demand for our products, changed customer daily routines or traffic to stores, or changed customer spending behaviors due to challenging economic conditions, could have a negative effect on our business.\n\n## Risks Related to E nvironmental, Social, and Governance Matters\n\n## Climate change may have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nWe recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted. For example, as we noted above, the supply and price of coffee we purchase can also be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, such as weather and water supply quality and availability. These factors may be caused by or exacerbated by climate change. Climate change may also result in decreased availability, less favorable pricing, or other adverse consequences for non-coffee inputs in our products. In addition to impacts in producing countries, climate change may affect the availability of water in the markets in which we operate and expect to operate and elsewhere in our supply chain, which could have adverse impacts on our business. We operate in 87 markets globally. Our properties and operations may be vulnerable to the various adverse effects of climate change, which are predicted to increase the frequency and severity of extreme weather events and other natural cycles such as wildfires and droughts. Such events have the potential to disrupt our operations, cause store closures, disrupt the business of our third-party suppliers, and impact our customers and partners, all of which may cause us to suffer losses and incur additional costs to maintain or resume operations.\n\n## Our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations and expectations, including with respect to environmental, social, and governance matters, that could expose us to numerous risks.\n\nWe are subject to changing rules and regulations promulgated by a number of regulators and organizations, including the SEC, the European Union, the Nasdaq Stock Market, and the Financial Accounting Standards Board. These rules and regulations continue to evolve in scope and complexity, and many new requirements have been created in response to laws enacted by Congress and state legislatures, which in certain cases may be inconsistent with one another, making compliance more difficult and uncertain. In addition, regulators, customers, investors, employees, and other stakeholders are focusing on environmental, social, and governance (commonly referred to as 'ESG') matters and related disclosures and operational regulations. These changing rules, regulations, and stakeholder expectations have resulted in, and are likely to continue to result in, increased general and administrative ex penses and increased management time and attention spent complying with or meeting such regulations and expectations. For example, developing and acting on initiatives within the scope of ESG, and collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG-related information and metrics can be costly, difficult, and time consuming and is subject to evolving reporting standards, including the SEC's climate-related reporting requirements and similar proposals by other international regulatory bodies. For example, the European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive ('CSRD'), with different implementation dates depending on company size and geographic location, has established extensive ESG-related disclosure requirements based on the European Sustainability Reporting Standards, including certain assurance obligations. The standards used to identify and collect the information and data required pursuant to the CSRD are still developing and uncertain, and this lack of certainty could result in increased costs related to complying with our reporting obligations under the CSRD and could increase the risk of failing to comply with the CSRD.\n\nWe may also communicate certain initiatives and goals related to environmental matters, diversity, responsible sourcing, social investments, and other ESG-related matters in our SEC filings or in other public disclosures. These initiatives and goals within the scope of ESG could be difficult and ex pensive to implement, the technologies needed to implement them may not be cost",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "The 18% increase in North America sales in 2021 was driven in part by increased unit sales, including those from third-party sellers. These third-party seller sales helped offset some of the financial pressures from increased shipping and fulfillment costs, which included higher wage rates, carrier fees, and fulfillment network inefficiencies.

      "answer": "GM's reliance on GM Financial for leasing and financing services (page 24) is directly impacted by GM Financial's interest rate risk profile. By 2021, GM Financial became liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within twelve months, compared to being asset-sensitive in 2020. This shift implies that rising interest rates would reduce net interest income, which is a key financial metric GM Financial monitors. Given GM's dependence on GM Financial to support vehicle sales and dealer financing, this increased sensitivity to interest rate changes introduces operational and financial risk for GM, especially in a rising rate environment.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

Specifically, rising costs\u2014including increased wage rates, carrier rates, and fulfillment network inefficiencies\u2014put downward pressure on operating income, but this was 'partially offset by increased unit sales, including sales by third-party sellers, and advertising sales.'

      "answer": "GM recognizes finance charge income from both retail and commercial finance receivables using the effective interest method, with accrual suspended for delinquent accounts. This income is a primary source of liquidity for GM Financial, which also relies on leasing income and collections on receivables. GM Financial's commercial finance receivables include $13.3 billion in dealer financing at the end of 2023, indicating a significant exposure to dealers' creditworthiness and repayment behavior. The connection reveals that GM's finance charge income recognition policy directly affects GM Financial's cash flow stability and liquidity planning, especially given the size of dealer financing within commercial receivables.",

      "answer": "Starbucks reported a goodwill balance of $2,788.5 million allocated to the International segment as of September 29, 2024, with the China reporting unit being a key component. The impairment assessment for this goodwill relies heavily on forward-looking revenue and cash flow projections. However, in the International segment, the company experienced a decline in licensed store revenue ($69 million) and faced significant foreign currency translation headwinds ($27 million), which could indicate deteriorating financial performance or market instability. These negative financial trends may challenge the optimistic assumptions used in the income approach of the goodwill impairment test, such as future revenue growth and discount rates, potentially increasing the risk of future impairment if these conditions persist.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "Starbucks reported a decline in International Segment revenue due to unfavorable foreign currency translation and lower product and equipment sales to licensees, which could suggest financial pressure on the segment.

The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "question": "How does Amazon's explanation of increased unit sales contributing to international sales growth align with the reported international operating loss, given the impact of foreign exchange rates on both sales and operating income?",
      "answer": "Amazon's 2021 international sales grew by 22%, driven by increased unit sales and advertising, despite fulfillment inefficiencies and supply chain constraints. However, the international segment reported an operating loss, which was attributed to higher shipping and fulfillment costs, wage increases, and marketing expenses, partially offset by the same unit sales growth. Foreign exchange rate changes had a dual impact: they positively affected international sales by $3.0 billion in 2021, yet negatively impacted operating income by $435 million. This suggests that while unit sales drove revenue growth internationally, cost pressures and adverse foreign exchange effects on operating income led to an overall operating loss, highlighting the tension between top-line growth and bottom-line profitability in international markets.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nThe estimates related to recall campaigns accrued at the time of vehicle sale are established by applying a paid loss approach that considers the number of historical recall campaigns and the estimated cost for each recall campaign. These estimates consider the nature, frequency and magnitude of historical recall campaigns, and use key assumptions including the number of historical periods and the weighting of historical data in the reserve studies. Costs associated with recall campaigns not accrued at the time of vehicle sale are estimated based on the estimated cost of repairs and the estimated vehicles to be repaired. Depending on part availability and time to complete repairs we may, from time to time, offer courtesy transportation at no cost to our customers. These estimates are reevaluated on an ongoing basis and based on the best available information. Revisions are made when necessary based on changes in these factors.\n\nThe estimated amount accrued for recall campaigns at the time of vehicle sale is most sensitive to the estimated number of recall events, the number of vehicles per recall event, the assumed number of vehicles that will be brought in by customers for repair (take rate) and the cost per vehicle for each recall event. The estimated cost of a recall campaign that is accrued on an individual basis is most sensitive to our estimated assumed take rate that is primarily developed based on our historical take rate experience. A 10% increase in the estimated take rate for all recall campaigns would increase the estimated cost by approximately $0.6 billion.\n\nActual experience could differ from the amounts estimated requiring adjustments to these liabilities in future periods. Due to the uncertainty and potential volatility of the factors contributing to developing estimates, changes in our assumptions could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nSales  Incentives The  estimated  effect  of  sales  incentives  offered  to  dealers  and  end  customers  is  recorded  as  a  reduction  of Automotive net sales and revenue at the time of sale. There may be numerous types of incentives available at any particular time. Incentive programs are generally specific to brand, model or sales region and are for specified time periods, which may be extended. Significant factors used in estimating the cost of incentives include type of program, forecasted sales volume, product mix, and the rate  of  customer  acceptance  of  incentive  programs,  all  of  which  are  estimated  based  on  historical  experience  and  assumptions concerning future customer behavior and market conditions. A change in any of these factors affecting the estimate could have a significant effect on recorded sales incentives. A 10% increase in the cost of incentives would increase the sales incentive liability by an insignificant amount. Subsequent adjustments to incentive estimates are possible as facts and circumstances change over time, which could affect the revenue previously recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue.\n\nGM Financial Allowance for Loan Losses The GM Financial retail finance receivables  portfolio  consists  of  smaller-balance, homogeneous loans that  are  carried  at  amortized  cost,  net  of  allowance  for  loan  losses.  The  allowance  for  loan  losses  on  retail finance receivables reflects net credit losses expected to be incurred over the remaining life of the retail finance receivables, which have a  weighted  average  remaining  life  of  approximately  two  years.  GM  Financial  forecasts  net  credit  losses  based  on  relevant information about past events, current conditions and forecast economic performance. GM Financial believes that the allowance is adequate to cover expected credit losses on the retail finance receivables; however, because the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates,  there  can  be  no  assurance  that  the  ultimate  charge-off  amount  will  not  exceed  such  estimates  or  that  our  credit  loss assumptions will not increase.\n\nGM Financial incorporates its outlook on forecast charge-off recovery rates and overall economic performance in its allowance estimate. Due to the high used vehicle prices in 2021, GM Financial increased its recovery rate forecast as of December 31, 2021. Each  5%  relative  decrease/increase  in  the  forecast  recovery  rates  would  increase/decrease  the  allowance  for  loan  losses  by approximately $0.1 billion.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the weightings applied to the economic forecast scenarios considered resulted in an allowance for loan losses on the retail finance receivables portfolio of $1.8 billion. Using different possible weightings that GM Financial could apply to the economic forecast scenarios result in an allowance for loan losses ranging from $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion. Actual economic data and recovery rates that are lower than those forecasted by GM Financial could result in an increase to the allowance for loan losses.\n\nThe GM Financial commercial finance receivables portfolio consists of floorplan financing as well as dealer loans, which are loans  to  finance  improvements  to  dealership  facilities,  to  provide  working  capital,  or  to  purchase  and/or  finance  dealership  real estate. The allowance for loan losses on commercial finance receivables is based on historical loss experience for the consolidated portfolio, in addition to forecasted industry vehicle sales. There can be no assurance that the ultimate charge-off amount will not exceed such estimates or that GM Financial's credit loss assumptions will not increase.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does GM's impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC through GM Financial relate to the sensitivity of GM Financial's leased vehicle residual values to used vehicle price fluctuations, and what does this imply about GM's exposure to broader market volatility in the automotive sector?",
      "answer": "GM recorded a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC through GM Financial, reflecting deteriorating market conditions in China and the challenges of sustaining profitability in that region. This impairment is directly tied to GM Financial\u2019s exposure to asset valuation risks, which are sensitive to external market factors such as used vehicle prices. GM Financial itself has a $23.5 billion estimated residual value in its leased vehicle portfolio, and a decline in used vehicle prices would result in higher depreciation or impairment charges. Furthermore, GM acknowledges in its risk factors that used vehicle availability and pricing are key drivers of new vehicle demand and overall market stability. Thus, the impairment of SAIC-GMAC, the sensitivity of GM Financial\u2019s lease residuals to used vehicle prices, and the broader risk of market volatility in new vehicle sales all form a connected chain of exposure that threatens both segment profitability and overall financial stability.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its ex pected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1)  the  sum  of  remaining  lease  payments  plus  estimated  residual  value;  over  (2)  leased  vehicles,  net  less  deferred  revenue. Alternatively,  if  used  vehicle  prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  effect  of  a  1%  relative  change  in  the  estimated  residual  values  at  December  31,  2024,  which  could  increase  or  decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks related to our operations\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability  of  affordable  financing,  elevated  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or uncertainty, the occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons, including a moderate to severe recession in any of the markets in which we operate, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials, energy or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, elevated cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials for our EV  propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EV s and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. G eopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic, regulatory and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials, energy and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of  the  largest  global  manufacturers  and  numerous  domestic  manufacturers,  which  have  ex perienced  significant  growth  in  customer  acceptance,  as  well  as  nontraditional  market  participants,  such  as  domestic  technology  companies.  Over  the  last  several  years,  this  intense  competition  and  an  increasingly  challenging operating environment negatively impacted the profitability of our operations in China, our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. As a result, in December 2024, our Board of Directors determined there to be a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JV s. Updated business forecasts and recent restructuring actions to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions have indicated that the loss in value is other-than-temporary for our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), certain SGM subsidiaries and SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC). As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024. We also recorded additional equity losses of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of these restructuring actions, which includes plant closures and portfolio optimization, in the year ended December 31, 2024. These charges are non-cash in nature. We expect SGM will likely incur additional restructuring charges in 2025. We cannot guarantee that the restructuring actions will be successful in our China JV s achieving long-term profitability or that additional, material restructuring actions will not be required.\n\nIn addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EV s, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies while achieving affordability. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China and the unique regulatory landscape in China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions, weakening economic conditions in China or China's level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.",

This valuation methodology reflects the company's exposure to market price fluctuations, which are also a factor in its commodity procurement strategy. On the operational side, the company notes that selling prices of commodity products are influenced by the market price it pays for those goods, and it relies on its ability to adjust selling prices to mitigate commodity price volatility. Thus, while the market price of Lowe\u2019s stock affects internal compensation valuations, the market-driven cost of commodities directly influences external pricing decisions.

      "answer": "GM Financial's liability-sensitive position implies that during a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. This sensitivity, as analyzed in their interest rate scenarios, highlights a financial risk that could impair GM Financial's ability to provide competitive leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to dealers. Since GM relies on GM Financial to support additional sales of its vehicles and expand market penetration, a decline in GM Financial's financial performance or access to capital could directly hinder GM's automotive business strategy. This exposure is further emphasized by GM's acknowledgment that any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such services would negatively affect GM's sales efforts, particularly in a rising rate environment.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does GM's impairment of its investment in SAIC-GMAC through GM Financial impact the sustainability of GM Financial's finance charge income, given the disclosed accounting treatment for finance charge income on delinquent accounts?",
      "answer": "GM recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its investment in SAIC-GMAC through GM Financial due to market challenges in China. GM Financial relies heavily on finance charge income from its portfolio of receivables, which is recognized using the effective interest method, with accrual suspended on accounts more than 60 days delinquent. The impairment of SAIC-GMAC, a financial services joint venture, suggests potential deterioration in asset quality and future cash flows, which could reduce the base of finance receivables available to generate finance charge income. This raises concerns about the sustainability of GM Financial's current level of finance charge income if similar impairments or delinquencies occur in other parts of its portfolio.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

Revenue, net of estimated returns, is recognized on the sale of parts upon delivery to the customer. When our customers have a right to return eligible parts and accessories, we consider the returns in our estimation of the transaction price.\n\nTypically,  transfers  to  daily  rental  companies  are  accounted  for  as  sales,  with  revenue  recognized  at  the  time  of  transfer.  We  defer  revenue  for  remarketing obligations, record a residual value guarantee and reflect a liability for amounts ex pected to be paid once the remarketing services are complete at the time of sale and recognize deferred revenue in earnings upon completion of the remarketing service.\n\nUsed Vehicles Proceeds from the auction of vehicles utilized by our employees are recognized in Automotive net sales and revenue upon transfer of control of the vehicle to the customer and the related vehicle carrying value is recognized in Automotive and other cost of sales.\n\nServices and Other Services and other revenue primarily consists of revenue from vehicle-related service arrangements and after-sale services such as maintenance, OnStar, Super Cruise, vehicle connectivity and extended service warranties. For those service arrangements that are bundled with a vehicle sale, a portion of the revenue from the sale is allocated to the service component and recognized as deferred revenue within Accrued liabilities or Other liabilities. We recognize revenue for bundled services and services sold separately as services are performed, typically over a period of up to eight years.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial Finance  charge  income  earned  on  finance  receivables  is  recognized  using  the  effective  interest  method.  Fees  and commissions received (including manufacturer subvention) and direct costs of originating loans are deferred and amortized over the term of the related finance receivables using the effective interest method and are removed from the consolidated balance sheets when the related finance receivables are fully charged off or paid in full. Accrual of finance charge income on retail finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 60 days delinquent, accounts in bankruptcy and accounts in repossession. Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to any fees due, then to any interest due and then any remaining amounts are applied to principal. Interest accrual generally resumes once an account has received payments bringing the delinquency to less than 60 days past due. Accrual of finance charge income on commercial finance receivables is generally suspended on accounts that are more than 90 days delinquent, upon receipt of a bankruptcy notice from a borrower, or where reasonable doubt exists about the full collectability of contractually agreed upon principal and interest.  Payments received on nonaccrual loans are first applied to principal. Interest accrual resumes once an account has received payments bringing the account fully current and collection of contractual principal and interest is reasonably assured (including amounts previously charged off).\n\nIncome from operating lease assets, which includes lease origination fees, net of lease origination costs, is recorded as operating lease revenue on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease agreement. G ains or losses realized upon disposition of off-lease assets including any payments received from lessees upon lease termination, are included in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses.\n\nAdvertising and Promotion E xpenditures Advertising and promotion expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other selling, general and administrative expense, were $3.3 billion, $3.6 billion and $4.0 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.\n\nResearch and Development E xpenditures Research and development expenditures, which are expensed as incurred in Automotive and other cost of sales, were $9.2 billion, $9.9 billion and $9.8 billion in the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. These ex penditures include cost sharing payments and fees we receive when we enter into cost sharing arrangements with third parties or nonconsolidated affiliates for product-related research, engineering, design and development activities and use of intellectual property.\n\nCash  E quivalents  and  Restricted  Cash Cash equivalents are defined as short-term, highly-liquid  investments  with  original  maturities  of 90 days or less.  Certain operating agreements require us to post cash as collateral. Cash and cash equivalents subject to contractual restrictions and not readily available are classified as restricted cash. Restricted cash is invested in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements and include amounts related to various deposits, escrows and other cash collateral. Restricted cash is included in Other current assets and Other assets in the consolidated balance sheets.",

      "answer": "GM Financial reported $7,266 million in leased vehicle income in 2023, a decline from $7,811 million in 2022, indicating weakening performance in its leasing business. This downward trend is occurring alongside deteriorating market conditions in China, which have significantly impacted GM's joint ventures and related investments. Specifically, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to fair value. The impairment was attributed to the same challenging market dynamics\u2014intense competition, excess capacity, and regulatory pressures\u2014that are affecting both the automotive and financial services arms of GM's China operations. The decline in leased vehicle income, therefore, aligns with broader financial stress in the region, reinforcing the strategic and financial interdependence between GM Financial\u2019s leasing performance and its exposure to Chinese automotive finance entities like SAIC-GMAC.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How does GM Financial's expectation of used vehicle prices decreasing in 2022 relative to 2021 align with the $29.1 billion estimated residual value of leased vehicles at year-end 2021, and what would be the financial impact of a 1% relative decline in residual values on depreciation expense?",
      "answer": "GM Financial expected used vehicle prices in 2022 to decrease from 2021 levels but remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. At the same time, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicle portfolio at December 31, 2021, was $29.1 billion. The company acknowledged that a 1% relative decline in residual values would result in an increase in depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio. Therefore, the anticipated drop in used vehicle prices introduces a risk of higher depreciation costs, which would directly affect GM Financial's financial performance.",

        "Hop 2: Used Vehicle Prices \u2192 Residual Value Estimates: Used vehicle prices directly influence residual value estimates, as higher prices historically allowed GM Financial to increase residual value estimates at year-end 2021, while weaker prices would result in higher depreciation expense or impairment charges.",

If  a decrease  in  residual  values  is  concentrated  among  specific  asset  groups,  the  decrease  could  result  in  an  immediate  impairment charge.  GM  Financial  reviewed  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio  for  indicators  of  impairment  and  determined  that  no  impairment indicators were present at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nUsed vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, GM Financial expects used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory.\n\nPension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "Given the 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2022, how does the growth in Selling and Administrative Expense relate to the revenue contribution from the Global Brand Divisions, which was only $102 million in total Nike Brand revenues?",
      "answer": "The 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2022 was driven by higher Selling and Administrative Expenses, which totaled $14,804 million in 2022 and were primarily attributed to increased demand creation and operating overhead expenses. Despite this significant investment, the Global Brand Divisions contributed only $102 million in revenue, indicating a disproportionately high expense-to-revenue ratio. This suggests that the Global Brand Divisions operate with a strategic, cost-center orientation focused on centralized brand management and digital infrastructure, rather than direct revenue generation. The minimal revenue contribution contrasts with the significant expense outlay, highlighting the strategic nature of these divisions in supporting broader geographic and brand initiatives rather than generating standalone profitability.",

      "question": "Given GM's reliance on FICO scores to assess retail finance receivables, how does the concentration of Prime-rated loans (FICO 680+) at $47.543 billion as a percentage of total receivables align with their stated allowance for loan losses being flat at 2.7% year-over-year?",
      "answer": "GM Financial's retail finance receivables are stratified by FICO score to assess credit risk, with Prime-rated loans (FICO 680 and above) representing $47.543 billion or 72.8% of the total $65.322 billion portfolio at year-end 2023. Despite this relatively high-quality segment dominating the portfolio, GM's allowance for loan losses remained unchanged at 2.7% of finance receivables for both 2023 and 2022. This suggests that while the company maintains a conservative underwriting approach by focusing on higher FICO-score borrowers, it has not adjusted its loss reserves despite shifts in portfolio composition. The flat allowance may indicate stable credit performance expectations or conservative provisioning regardless of portfolio quality.",

However, this growth was accompanied by a decline in operating income, which was negatively impacted by rising fulfillment costs\u2014including increased shipping and labor expenses, fulfillment network inefficiencies, and supply chain constraints. While unit sales growth partially offset these rising costs, the fulfillment and operational challenges outpaced the benefits of higher sales volume, leading to a decline in profitability.

      "answer": "Tesla's Energy Generation and Storage segment reported a gross margin of -4.6% in 2021, indicating a loss-making performance. This segment includes revenue from Solar Energy Systems Incentives, which are integral to its revenue base. However, despite contributing to revenue, the segment's gross margin remains negative, contrasting sharply with the Automotive segment's 29.3% gross margin. This suggests that the inclusion of Solar Energy Systems Incentives does not offset the segment's cost of revenues, highlighting operational inefficiencies or lower profitability in the energy segment compared to the automotive business.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## Automotive &amp; Services and Other Segment\n\nAutomotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash deliveries of new Model S, Model X, Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, including access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. Cash deliveries are vehicles that are not subject to lease accounting.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits includes sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers. Our revenue from automotive regulatory credits is directly related to our new vehicle production, sales and pricing negotiated with our customers. We monetize them proactively as new vehicles are sold based on standing arrangements with buyers of such credits, typically as close as possible to the production and delivery of the vehicle or changes in regulation impacting the credits.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of revenue for vehicles under direct operating lease agreements as well as those sold with resale value guarantees accounted for as operating leases under lease accounting. Additionally, automotive leasing revenue includes direct sales-type leasing programs where we recognize all revenue associated with the sales-type lease upon delivery to the customer.\n\nServices and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.\n\n## 2021 compared to 2020\n\nAutomotive sales revenue increased $19.52 billion, or 79%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase of 433,815 Model 3 and Model Y cash deliveries year over year from production ramping at both Gigafactory Shanghai and the Fremont Factory at a slightly higher combined average selling price from a higher proportion of Model Y sales offset by regional sales mix. Additionally, we had a $365 million net release of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees, which increased our automotive sales revenue, due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021. The increases in automotive sales revenue were partially offset by a decrease of 28,819 Model S and Model X cash deliveries at a higher combined average selling price as deliveries of the new versions of Model S and Model X only began ramping in the second and fourth quarters of 2021, respectively.\n\nAutomotive regulatory credits revenue decreased $115 million, or 7%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to changes in regulation which entitled us to additional credits in the prior year and changes in pricing in certain regions.\n\nAutomotive leasing revenue increased $590 million, or 56%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in cumulative vehicles under our direct operating lease program and an increase in direct sales-type leasing revenue as we have a full year of sales in 2021 since we began offering the program during the third quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in automotive leasing revenue associated with our resale value guarantee leasing programs accounted for as operating leases as those portfolios have declined.\n\nServices and other revenue increased $1.50 billion, or 65%, in the year ended December 31, 2021 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to an increase in used vehicle revenue driven by increases in volume and average selling prices of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services revenue as our fleet continues to grow and retail merchandise revenue.\n\n## Energy Generation and Storage Segment\n\nEnergy generation and storage revenue includes sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products, services related to such products and sales of solar energy systems incentives.",

      "answer": "GM's reliance on GM Financial to provide competitive financing and leasing services is directly tied to the $4,103 million in finance charge income reported in GM Financial\u2019s revenue (page 67). This income is a core component of GM Financial\u2019s liquidity, which it uses to fund finance receivables, repay debt, and maintain operations (page 43). However, as outlined in the risk factors (page 24), disruptions in GM Financial\u2019s access to capital or performance issues in its loan and lease portfolios could impair its ability to generate such income and continue offering financing services. This interdependence means that any decline in GM Financial's liquidity or operational performance could reduce finance charge income and, consequently, weaken GM's ability to support vehicle sales through customer and dealer financing.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "answer": "GM allocates engineering expenses as part of the Automotive segment\u2019s operating costs, which are then factored into adjusted performance metrics like EBIT-adjusted and ROIC-adjusted. Engineering costs are included in segment expenses such as 'material and logistics; manufacturing; equity income; selling, general and administrative people-related costs; advertising; information technology; engineering; professional services; and policy, campaign, and warranty' (page 104). These expenses influence the EBIT-adjusted calculation, which excludes interest, taxes, and certain non-core adjustments but retains engineering as part of core operations. This treatment affects ROIC-adjusted, which is calculated using EBIT-adjusted and net assets, meaning that engineering investments directly influence the return on invested capital metric used by management to assess capital allocation decisions.",

Examples of adjustments to EBIT include, but are not limited to, impairment charges on long-lived assets and other exit costs resulting from strategic shifts in our operations or discrete market and business conditions, and certain costs arising from legal matters. For EBIT-adjusted and our other non-GAAP measures, once we have made an adjustment in the current period for an item, we will also adjust the related non-GAAP measure in any future periods in which there is an impact from the item. Our corresponding measure for our GM Financial segment is EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are part of operating results when assessing and measuring the operational and financial performance of the segment.\n\nEPS-diluted-adjusted (Most comparable GAAP measure: Diluted earnings per common share) EPS-diluted-adjusted is used by management and can be used by investors to review our consolidated diluted EPS results on a consistent basis. EPS-diluted-adjusted is calculated as net income attributable to common stockholdersdiluted  less  adjustments  noted  above  for  EBIT-adjusted  and  certain  income  tax   adjustments  divided  by  weighted-average  common  shares  outstanding-diluted. Examples of income tax adjustments include the establishment or release of significant deferred tax asset valuation allowances.\n\nETR-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Effective  tax  rate) ETR-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  the consolidated effective tax rate for our core operations on a consistent basis. ETR-adjusted is calculated as Income tax expense less the income tax related to the adjustments noted above for  EBIT-adjusted and the income tax adjustments noted above for  EPS-diluted-adjusted divided by  Income before income taxes less adjustments. When we provide an expected adjusted effective tax rate, we do not provide an expected effective tax rate because the U.S. GAAP measure may include significant adjustments that are difficult to predict.\n\nROIC-adjusted (Most  comparable  GAAP  measure:  Return  on  equity) ROIC-adjusted  is  used  by  management  and  can  be  used  by  investors  to  review  our investment and capital allocation decisions. We define ROIC-adjusted as EBIT-adjusted for the trailing four quarters divided by ROIC-adjusted average net assets, which is considered to be the average equity balances adjusted for average automotive debt and interest liabilities, exclusive of finance leases; average automotive net pension and OPEB liabilities; and average automotive net income tax assets during the same period.\n\nAdjusted automotive free cash flow (Most comparable GAAP measure: Net automotive cash provided by operating activities) Adjusted automotive free cash flow is used by management and can be used by investors to review the liquidity of our automotive operations and to measure and monitor our performance against our capital allocation program and evaluate our automotive liquidity against the substantial cash requirements of our automotive operations. We measure adjusted automotive free cash flow as automotive operating cash flow from operations less capital expenditures adjusted for management actions. Management actions can include  voluntary  events  such  as  discretionary  contributions  to  employee  benefit  plans  or  nonrecurring  specific  events  such  as  a  closure  of  a  facility  that  are considered special for EBIT-adjusted purposes.

      "question": "How does GM Financial's provision for loan losses relate to the $0.3 billion impairment charge recorded on its SAIC-GMAC investment in light of the restructuring of GM's China joint ventures?",
      "answer": "GM Financial records a provision for loan losses as part of its standard accounting for finance receivables, which includes recognizing expected credit losses over the life of those receivables. In the context of GM's operations in China, the company and its joint venture partners restructured their operations due to intense market competition and regulatory pressures, leading to significant impairment charges. Specifically, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its investment in SAIC-GMAC, a financial services joint venture in China. This impairment reflects the deteriorating financial outlook and reduced cash flow expectations from the China joint ventures, which also influenced GM Financial's credit risk exposure and expectations of loan performance. The provision for loan losses and the impairment charge are thus connected through the deteriorating credit environment in China, which directly impacted GM Financial\u2019s asset quality and valuation assumptions.",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

What does this consistent goodwill balance suggest about the company's acquisition and partnership strategy execution during this period?",
      "answer": "The consistent goodwill balance of $34.7 million for the Channel Development segment over three consecutive fiscal years suggests that Starbucks did not record any new acquisitions or material impairment adjustments during this time, despite emphasizing growth through external partnerships with companies like Nestl\u00e9 and PepsiCo. This implies that either the company's strategic partnerships did not involve significant goodwill-generating acquisitions, or that the fair value of acquired assets remained stable, with no major write-downs or additions to goodwill. It may also indicate that Starbucks focused on expanding its channel development through contractual arrangements rather than asset acquisitions, which would not necessarily impact goodwill. This alignment of static goodwill with strategic emphasis raises questions about the nature and structure of these partnerships in terms of their accounting treatment.",

      "answer": "Nike achieved a 10 basis point increase in gross margin for fiscal 2024 by reducing NIKE Brand product costs, primarily through lower ocean freight and logistics expenses. This cost reduction is closely tied to the company's foreign exchange risk management program, which actively hedges against currency fluctuations on product costs\u2014particularly for NIKE entities purchasing from the NIKE Trading Company (NTC), where transactions are often denominated in non-functional currencies. As of May 31, 2024, Nike maintained a $1,282 million sales-related reserve, which indirectly supports the financial buffer needed to manage such cost volatility.

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How does GM's reliance on GM Financial for customer financing interact with the volatility in used vehicle prices, and what impact does this have on GM's expectations for residual value performance and potential impairment charges?",
      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services, which directly supports vehicle sales. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are influenced by used vehicle prices. In 2021, used vehicle prices were elevated due to low new vehicle inventory, resulting in gains on leased vehicle terminations of $2.0 billion. However, GM Financial expects used vehicle prices in 2022 to decline from 2021 levels but remain above pre-pandemic levels due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. This expectation influences residual value assumptions and could affect lease return rates. Despite potential decreases in used vehicle prices, GM Financial determined at year-end 2021 that no impairment indicators were present in the leased vehicle portfolio, suggesting that residual values remain aligned with current market conditions. The interplay between GM Financial\u2019s exposure to used vehicle prices and residual value performance highlights the financial sensitivity of GM\u2019s automotive financing arm to broader market dynamics.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nIn addition, many of our advanced technologies, including AVs, present novel issues with which domestic and foreign regulators have only limited experience, and will be subject to evolving regulatory frameworks. Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

These actions could give rise to future asset impairments or other charges, which may have a material impact on our operating results.\n\nGMNA Industry sales in North America were 18.5 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 4.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021. Dealer inventory remains constrained for several critical vehicles, including our full-size trucks and full-size SUVs.\n\nOur total vehicle sales in the U.S., our largest market in North America, were 2.2 million units for a market share of 14.4% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 2.7 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nWe expect to sustain relatively strong EBIT-adjusted margins in 2022 on the continued strength of favorable vehicle pricing and strong U.S. industry light vehicle demand, partially offset by higher costs associated with commodities, raw materials and logistics. Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.8 million units for a market share of 3.6% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 1.1 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020.\n\nCruise Cruise is actively testing A Vs in the United States. Gated by safety and regulation, the goal of Cruise is to deliver its selfdriving services as soon as possible.\n\nIn  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  Cruise  Holdings  issued  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  (Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares)  in exchange  for  $2.7  billion  from  Microsoft  Corporation  (Microsoft),  Walmart  Inc.  (Walmart)  and  other  investors,  including $1.0  billion  from  General  Motors  Holdings  LLC.  All  proceeds  related  to  the  Cruise  Class  G  Preferred  Shares  are  designated exclusively  for  working  capital  and  general  corporate  purposes  of  Cruise  Holdings.  In  addition,  Cruise  Holdings  and  Microsoft entered into a long-term strategic relationship to accelerate the commercialization of self-driving vehicles. Refer to Note 20 to our consolidated financial statements for further details.\n\nAutomotive  Financing  -  GM  Financial  Summary  and  Outlook We believe  that  offering  a  comprehensive  suite  of  financing products  will  generate  incremental  sales  of  our  vehicles,  drive  incremental  GM  Financial  earnings  and  help  support  our  sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. Used vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, we expect used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory. The increase in used vehicle prices resulted in gains on terminations of leased vehicles of $2.0 billion in GM Financial interest, operating and other expenses for the year ended",

GM  Financial  reviewed  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio  for  indicators  of  impairment  and  determined  that  no  impairment indicators were present at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nUsed vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory.

Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.",

      "question": "How does GM's 2024 impairment charge of $142 million related to Cruise's technology and intellectual property reconcile with the $522 million net charges recorded by Cruise in December 2024 following GM's decision to stop funding robotaxi development?",
      "answer": "GM recorded a $142 million impairment charge in 2024 related to the write-off of technology and intellectual property associated with Cruise, reflecting the diminished value of these intangible assets. Later in December 2024, after GM announced it would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development and planned to combine Cruise's and GM's technical efforts, Cruise recorded $522 million in net charges, including $173 million in non-cash restructuring charges. These charges indicate a broader restructuring and strategic pivot, which aligns with the earlier impairment decision. Together, the two figures suggest a coordinated financial recognition of the reduced strategic value and operational scope of Cruise's autonomous vehicle initiatives.",

This $2.7 billion increase in dealer financing aligns with the growth in GM Financial's net sales, suggesting that expanded financing activities, especially in dealer financing, contributed to the segment's revenue growth.

      "question": "How does GM Financial's $0.3 billion impairment charge related to its SAIC-GMAC investment impact its ability to sustain the growth in finance charge income, given the increase from $4.5 billion in 2022 to $6.2 billion in 2023?",
      "answer": "GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment in response to the challenging market conditions affecting GM's China joint ventures. This impairment reflects a decline in the fair value of the investment and signals financial stress in the Chinese market, which could constrain GM Financial's future earnings potential. However, GM Financial reported a significant increase in finance charge income from $4.5 billion in 2022 to $6.2 billion in 2023, indicating strong performance in its core financial services despite the impairment. The growth in finance charge income may suggest resilience or diversification in GM Financial\u2019s revenue streams, potentially offsetting some of the negative impact from the impairment. Nevertheless, the impairment raises concerns about the long-term stability of income from international investments, particularly in China, even as the financial services segment shows recent growth.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSGM is a joint venture we established with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) (50%). SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "Given the increasing concentration of Prime borrowers with FICO scores of 680 or higher in GM Financial's retail finance receivables portfolio, how does GM's reliance on FICO scores for risk stratification align with the unchanged 2.7% allowance for loan losses as a percentage of finance receivables at year-end 2023?",
      "answer": "GM Financial's retail finance receivables portfolio shows a growing proportion of Prime borrowers with FICO scores of 680 or higher, increasing from $205 million in prior years to $47,543 million as of December 31, 2022, representing 72.8% of total receivables. This suggests an improving credit profile of borrowers. However, GM states that it 'relies heavily on FICO scores or their equivalents as a key metric' to stratify credit risk in its portfolio. Despite this increasing concentration of higher-quality borrowers, the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of finance receivables remained unchanged at 2.7% at December 31, 2023. This creates an analytical tension: while the credit quality of borrowers appears to be improving, GM has not adjusted its loan loss reserves downward, suggesting either conservative provisioning, changes in loss assumptions for specific segments, or limitations in how FICO scores alone predict actual losses in the current economic environment.",

      "answer": "Investors should interpret the relationship as a signal that despite generating $102 million in 'Other' revenues\u2014primarily from NIKE Brand licensing and miscellaneous sources\u2014the Global Brand Divisions experienced a 17% increase in pre-tax losses due to higher operating overhead and demand creation expenses. This suggests that the costs associated with centralized functions like product design, digital operations, and advertising are outpacing the revenue contributions from non-core, non-geographic revenue streams. The 'Other' revenue line, while positive, appears insufficient to offset the increased strategic investments and wage-related expenses, raising questions about the efficiency and scalability of these global brand support functions.",

      "answer": "GM reports an allowance for loan losses of $2.3 billion on GM Financial's retail finance receivables, which reflects expected credit losses over the remaining life of the portfolio, influenced by economic forecasts and recovery rates. This allowance is primarily tied to consumer lending and is sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions like unemployment and disposable income. Separately, GM Financial's commercial finance receivables, including $13.3 billion in dealer financing at the end of 2023, are subject to a different risk profile, relying on historical loss experience and industry forecasts. The connection between these two metrics highlights GM's dual exposure to both consumer and dealer credit risk, with the allowance for loan losses indirectly reflecting stress that could spill over from retail defaults to dealer financial health, especially under adverse economic scenarios.",

      "answer": "GM maintained a consistent 2.7% allowance for loan losses despite a 54% year-over-year increase in near-prime FICO score 620-679 receivables\u2014from $2,601 million in 2021 to $3,202 million in 2022. This suggests that GM views the near-prime segment as relatively stable from a credit risk perspective, not requiring a higher provisioning rate even as exposure grew. The alignment indicates a strategic assumption that the near-prime borrower cohort remains manageable within their existing risk framework, potentially reflecting confidence in underwriting standards or economic conditions supporting repayment capacity.",

      "answer": "GM increased residual value estimates in 2021 due to high used vehicle prices, which led to a prospective decrease in depreciation expense over the remaining term of the lease portfolio. However, GM Financial projected that used vehicle prices might decline in 2022 compared to 2021 levels, although remaining above pre-pandemic levels. If used vehicle prices fall below estimates, GM Financial would face increased depreciation expense or impairment charges on the lease portfolio. This dynamic highlights the sensitivity of residual value assumptions to market conditions and the financial risk exposure embedded in GM Financial\u2019s leasing operations.",

Each leased asset in the portfolio represents a vehicle that GM Financial owns and has leased to a customer. At lease inception, an estimate is made of the expected residual value for the vehicle at the end of the lease term, which typically ranges from two to five years. GM Financial estimates the expected residual value based on third-party data that considers various data points and assumptions, including, but not limited to, recent auction values, the expected future volume of returning leased vehicles, significant liquidation of rental or fleet inventory, used vehicle prices, manufacturer incentive programs and fuel prices. Realization of the residual values is dependent on the future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nThe customer is obligated to make payments during the lease term for the difference between the purchase price and the contract residual value plus a money factor. However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the value of the vehicle is lower than the residual value estimated at lease inception.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $29.1 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its expected  residual  value  at  the  end  of  the  lease  term.  In  2021,  prices  on  leased  vehicles  at  termination  generally  exceeded  their contractual  residual  values  due  to  high  used  vehicle  prices. Accordingly,  GM  Financial  increased  the  residual  value  estimates  at December  31,  2021,  which  will  result  in  a  prospective  decrease  in  the  depreciation  rate  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased vehicles portfolio. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record  an  impairment  charge  on  the  lease  portfolio.  If  an  impairment  exists,  GM  Financial  would  determine  any  shortfall  in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1) the sum of remaining lease payments plus estimated residual value; over (2) leased vehicles, net less deferred revenue. Alternatively, if used vehicle  prices  outperform  GM  Financial's  latest  estimates,  it  may  record  gains  on  sales  of  off-lease  vehicles  and/or  decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe following table illustrates the effect of a 1% relative change in the estimated residual values at December 31, 2021, which could  increase  or  decrease  depreciation  expense  over  the  remaining  term  of  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio,  holding  all  other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

If  a decrease  in  residual  values  is  concentrated  among  specific  asset  groups,  the  decrease  could  result  in  an  immediate  impairment charge.  GM  Financial  reviewed  the  leased  vehicle  portfolio  for  indicators  of  impairment  and  determined  that  no  impairment indicators were present at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nUsed vehicle prices were higher in 2021 compared to 2020 levels, primarily due to low new vehicle inventory. In 2022, GM Financial expects used vehicle prices may decrease relative to 2021 levels, but to remain above pre-pandemic levels, primarily due to sustained low new vehicle inventory.\n\nPension and OPEB Plans Our defined benefit pension plans are accounted for on an actuarial basis, which requires the selection of various assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, a discount rate, mortality rates of participants and expectation of mortality improvement. Our pension obligations include Korean statutory pension payments that are valued on a walk away basis. The expected long-term rate of return on U.S. plan assets that is utilized in determining pension expense is derived from periodic studies, which include a review of asset allocation strategies, anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes, risks using standard deviations and correlations of returns among the asset classes that comprise the plans' asset mix. While the studies give appropriate consideration to recent plan performance and historical returns, the assumptions are primarily long-term, prospective rates of return.",

      "answer": "GMNA's revenue growth of $13.067 billion in 2023 is partially attributed to a $8.5 billion increase from volume variance, indicating higher unit sales contributed significantly to the overall revenue growth. This aligns with the reported increase in fleet sales from 564,000 units in 2022 to 679,000 units in 2023, a growth of 115,000 units or 20.4%. While the volume variance quantifies the financial impact of increased sales volume, the fleet sales metric provides context on the scale of unit growth, particularly in commercial or bulk sales channels. Together, these figures suggest that growth in high-volume transactions, such as fleet sales, played a critical role in driving GMNA's top-line performance during the year.",

This aligns with the disclosure that the Global Brand Divisions centrally manage demand creation, product design, and global digital operations. These functions are not tied to specific geographic segments and instead support the broader NIKE Brand strategy, which explains why this revenue is separately categorized and not included in regional performance metrics.",

      "question": "What factors might have contributed to the $391.6 million decline in Starbucks' International segment goodwill balance between 2021 and 2022, and how does this impairment relate to the segment's operational performance and strategic positioning as described in the company's store licensing and market expansion activities?",
      "answer": "Starbucks' International segment goodwill balance declined from $3,148.3 million in 2021 to $2,756.7 million in 2022, representing a $391.6 million reduction. This significant impairment suggests potential underperformance or revised growth expectations for the International segment. The segment's operational activities, including its reliance on licensed stores and market expansion strategies, may have influenced this decline. The International segment plays a key role in global store licensing, where Starbucks leverages local partners' market knowledge while maintaining brand consistency through training and operational procedures. Given that licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022 and typically have a lower gross margin but higher operating margin than company-operated stores, any challenges in this model\u2014such as market saturation, underperforming licensees, or difficulties in desirable retail space acquisition\u2014could have contributed to the goodwill impairment. Additionally, the segment's involvement in international markets like China and Japan, where Starbucks Cards and loyalty programs are expanding, may have faced execution challenges that affected long-term growth projections.",

(1)\n\n## Stored Value Cards and Loyalty Program\n\nThe Starbucks Card, our branded stored value card program, is designed to provide customers with a convenient payment method, support gifting and increase the frequency of store visits by cardholders, in part through the related Starbucks Rewards loyalty program where available, as discussed below. Stored value cards are issued to customers when they initially load them with an account balance. They can be obtained in our company-operated and most licensed stores in North America, China, Japan and many of our markets in our International segment. Stored value cards can also be obtained online, via the Starbucks Mobile App and through other U.S. and international retailers. Customers may access their card balances by utilizing their stored value card or the Starbucks Mobile App in participating stores. In nearly all markets, including the U.S. and Canada, customers who register their Starbucks Cards are automatically enrolled in the Starbucks Rewards program. Registered members can receive various benefits depending on factors such as the number of reward points ('Stars') earned. In addition to using their Starbucks Cards, Starbucks Rewards members can earn Stars by paying with cash, credit or debit cards, or selected mobile wallets at all company-operated stores and a majority of licensed stores in North America. Using the Mobile Order and Pay functionality of the Starbucks Mobile App, customers can also place orders in advance for pick-up at certain participating locations in several markets. Refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Estimates, included in Item 8 of Part II of this 10-K, for further discussion of our stored value cards and loyalty program. \u00ae \u00ae\n\n## Licensed Stores\n\nRevenues from our licensed stores accounted for 11% of total net revenues in fiscal 2022. Licensed stores generally have a lower gross margin and a higher operating margin than company-operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a margin on branded products and supplies sold to the licensed store operator along with a royalty on retail sales. Licensees are responsible for operating costs and capital investments, which more than offset the lower revenues we receive under the licensed store model.\n\nIn our licensed store operations, we seek to leverage the expertise of our local partners and share our operating and store development experience. Licensees provide improved, and at times the only, access to desirable retail space. Most licensees are prominent retailers with in-depth market knowledge and access. As part of these arrangements, we sell coffee, tea, food and related products to licensees for resale to customers and receive royalties and license fees from the licensees. We also sell certain equipment, such as coffee brewers and espresso machines, to our licensees for use in their operations. Licensee employees working in licensed retail locations are required to follow our detailed store operating procedures and attend training classes similar to those given to employees in company-operated stores. In a limited number of international markets, we also use traditional franchising and include these stores in the results of operations from our other licensed stores.",

      "answer": "GM Financial plays a critical role in dealer financing, holding $13.3 billion in dealer financing balances at December 31, 2023, which indicates a significant financial services dependency in GM's ecosystem. This dealer financing activity, detailed in the commercial finance receivables section, likely contributes to the broader financial performance of GM Financial. In the net sales and revenue variance analysis, GM Financial is attributed with a $1.5 billion 'Other Variance' that positively impacted year-over-year revenue growth. The connection suggests that the financial services segment's performance\u2014potentially driven by increased dealer financing activity\u2014contributed meaningfully to GM's overall revenue growth beyond volume, mix, or pricing effects. This implies that GM Financial's operational activities, such as dealer financing, directly influence the company's broader financial results through non-operational variance components.",

      "question": "How does GM's deferral of $0.8 billion in engineering and capital spending costs for Cruise interact with Cruise's $0.7 billion in unrecognized compensation expenses to impact the autonomous vehicle segment's near-term EBIT-adjusted trajectory?",
      "answer": "GM's deferral of up to $0.8 billion in engineering and capital spending costs for Cruise (Page 42) temporarily reduces Cruise's immediate cash outflows, providing short-term liquidity relief. However, this benefit is contrasted by the $0.7 billion in unrecognized compensation expenses (Page 100) that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. These compensation expenses represent a significant future cost burden that could pressure Cruise's EBIT-adjusted performance, even as GM defers some capital demands. While the deferral agreement supports near-term operational flexibility, the looming recognition of compensation costs suggests that Cruise will face increasing margin pressures unless revenue growth or cost controls offset these obligations.",

      "question": "Given the 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2022, how does the growth in Selling and Administrative Expense, driven by demand creation and operating overhead, reconcile with the relatively modest revenue growth in the same period?",
      "answer": "The 17% increase in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes in fiscal 2022 was driven by a significant rise in Selling and Administrative Expense, which grew from $13,025 million in fiscal 2021 to $14,804 million in fiscal 2022. This increase was primarily due to higher demand creation expenses (from $3,114 million to $3,850 million) and increased operating overhead ($9,911 million to $10,954 million), reflecting investments in digital capabilities and strategic technology. However, total revenues only grew modestly from $44,538 million to $46,710 million, indicating that the expense growth outpaced revenue gains. This suggests a short-term margin pressure as Nike prioritized long-term strategic investments over immediate profitability.",

      "answer": "GM depends on GM Financial to provide leasing and financing services to customers and dealers, which directly supports GM's vehicle sales and market penetration. GM Financial's ability to offer competitive financing is influenced by its interest rate exposure, which is measured through net interest income sensitivity. As of December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that a rise in interest rates would cause interest expenses to increase faster than interest income, initially reducing net interest income. This sensitivity could constrain GM Financial\u2019s profitability and, in turn, its capacity to support GM\u2019s automotive sales through financing, especially if interest rates rise significantly.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

The potential decrease in fair value from a 50 basis point increase in interest rates would have been insignificant at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\nEquity Price Risk We are subject to equity price risk due to market price volatility primarily related to our investment in Stellantis warrants and other insignificant investments. The fair value of investments with exposure to equity price risk was $1.5 billion and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our investment in Stellantis warrants is valued based on a Black-Scholes formula. We estimate that a 10% adverse change in quoted security prices in Stellantis would have had an insignificant effect at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nInterest Rate Risk Fluctuations in market interest rates can affect GM Financial's gross interest rate spread, which is the difference between interest earned on finance receivables and interest paid on debt. GM Financial is exposed to interest rate risks as financial assets and liabilities have different characteristics that may impact financial performance. These differences may include tenor, yield, re-pricing  timing,  and  prepayment  expectations. Typically  retail  finance  receivables  and  leases  purchased  by  GM  Financial  earn fixed interest and commercial finance receivables originated by GM Financial earn variable interest. GM Financial funds its business with variable or fixed rate debt. The variable rate debt is subject to adjustments to reflect prevailing market interest rates. To help mitigate interest rate risk or mismatched funding, GM Financial may employ hedging.\n\nQuantitative Disclosure GM Financial measures the sensitivity of its net interest income to changes in interest rates by using interest rate scenarios that assume a hypothetical, instantaneous parallel shift of one hundred basis points in all interest rates across all  maturities,  as  well  as  a  base  case  that  assumes  that  rates  perform  at  the  current  market  forward  curve.  However,  interest  rate changes are rarely instantaneous or parallel and rates could move more or less than the one percentage point assumed in our analysis. Therefore,  the  actual  impact  to  net  interest  income  could  be  higher  or  lower  than  the  results  detailed  in  the  table  below.  These interest rate scenarios are purely hypothetical and do not represent our view of future interest rate movements.\n\nAt December 31, 2021, GM Financial was liability-sensitive, meaning that more liabilities than assets were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest paid on liabilities would increase more than the interest earned on assets, which would initially decrease net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially increase. At December 31, 2020, GM Financial was asset-sensitive, meaning that more assets than liabilities were expected to re-price within the next twelve months. During a period of rising interest rates, the interest earned on assets would increase more than the interest paid on liabilities, which would initially increase net interest income. During a period of falling interest rates, net interest income would be expected to initially decrease.\n\nGM Financial's net interest income sensitivity decreased in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increased proportion of rate sensitive liabilities exposure relative to rate sensitive assets exposure. GM Financial's hedging strategies approved by its global asset liability committee are used to manage interest rate risk within policy guidelines.

      "answer": "GM reported a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its investment in SAIC-GMAC through GM Financial, indicating a significant decline in the fair value of that investment. However, in the same period, GMFinancial reported net sales and revenue of $12,760 million, which includes income from leased vehicles, finance charges, and other income streams. The impairment charge suggests underlying financial stress in GM Financial's investment portfolio, particularly in its Chinese joint ventures, which may not be directly reflected in its reported net sales and revenue figures.

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "The $102 million in revenues from NIKE Brand licensing, as disclosed in the Global Brand Divisions' financials, is explicitly stated to be part of the 'Other' revenue category and is not attributed to any geographic operating segment. This aligns with the broader explanation that Global Brand Divisions include centrally managed demand creation, product design, and digital operations, along with licensing and other non-geographic revenue streams. The fact that licensing is not tied to geographic segments suggests that it serves a global, brand-centric function rather than a region-specific sales strategy. Furthermore, the increase in operating loss for the Global Brand Divisions in fiscal 2022\u2014driven by higher demand creation and technology investments\u2014implies that licensing is integrated into a broader strategic push to strengthen the global brand identity and digital footprint, rather than being a standalone revenue driver.",

      "answer": "GM's risk factors on page 24 emphasize that any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide leasing and financing would negatively affect GM's sales and market penetration. This concern is directly tied to GM Financial's borrowing capacity, which saw a substantial increase in 2021, including $25.8 billion in renewed revolving credit facilities and $23.3 billion in securitization notes payable. This expansion of GM Financial\u2019s secured and unsecured debt capacity supports its ability to sustain competitive financing offerings to GM\u2019s customers and dealers, mitigating the risk outlined in the risk factors. Furthermore, GM itself increased its borrowing capacity during the year, exemplified by the expansion of its five-year facility from $10.5 billion to $11.2 billion and the renewal of a $2.0 billion facility exclusively for GM Financial. These coordinated actions suggest a strategic alignment between GM and GM Financial to ensure continued access to capital, supporting both operational needs and GM\u2019s broader liquidity and growth objectives. The synthesis of these facts reveals a deliberate effort to strengthen GM Financial\u2019s financial foundation as a critical enabler of GM\u2019s automotive sales strategy.",

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

Most of the secured debt was issued by VIEs and is repayable only from proceeds related to the underlying pledged assets.

GM Financial is required to hold certain funds in restricted cash accounts to provide additional collateral for borrowings under certain secured credit facilities. The weighted-average interest rate on secured debt was 1.27% at December 31, 2021. The revolving credit facilities have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2027 and securitization notes payable have maturity dates ranging from 2022 to 2034.

This divergence suggests that while GM Financial experienced revenue growth from leasing and finance charge income, the impairment of its minority investments, such as SAIC-GMAC, introduced a financial drag that was not reflected in the top-line revenue figures. The impairment underscores underlying financial risks in GM Financial\u2019s investment portfolio that contrast with the positive revenue trend.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSGM is a joint venture we established with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) (50%). SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "question": "How does the growth in GMFinancial's net sales and revenue from 2023 to 2024 compare with the change in GM's overall consolidated net sales and revenue during the same period, and what does this suggest about the relative performance of GMFinancial within GM's broader business segments?",
      "answer": "GMFinancial's net sales and revenue increased from $12,133 million in 2023 to $13,575 million in 2024, representing a growth of $1,442 million or approximately 11.9%. In contrast, GM's overall consolidated net sales and revenue grew from $171,842 million in 2023 to $187,442 million in 2024, an increase of $15,600 million or about 9.1%. This suggests that GMFinancial outperformed the broader company in terms of revenue growth, indicating a potentially stronger contribution from GMFinancial to GM's overall revenue expansion during this period.",

      "question": "How does GM's $0.7 billion of unrecognized compensation expense related to Cruise's share-based awards align with the valuation methodology applied to its investment in Cruise as disclosed in the fair value measurement notes?",
      "answer": "GM reports $0.7 billion of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested share-based awards granted by Cruise, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.9 years. This expense is tied to Cruise's common stock valuation, which also influences the fair value measurement of GM's investment in Cruise. In the fair value measurement section, GM explains that investments like Cruise are valued based on NAV per share as a practical expedient due to the lack of readily available market prices. The NAV is subject to management review and potential adjustment based on factors such as changes in underlying performance, market conditions, and expected sale prices. Therefore, while the compensation expense is based on Cruise's stock valuation at grant dates, the ongoing fair value of GM's investment in Cruise depends on broader NAV assessments that could diverge from the assumptions used in the compensation calculations.",

        "Hop 1: GM(page_100) \u2192 Unrecognized Compensation Expense: GM discloses $0.7 billion in unrecognized compensation expense related to Cruise's nonvested share-based awards as of December 31, 2023, to be recognized over 2.9 years.",
        "Hop 2: Unrecognized Compensation Expense \u2192 Cruise: The compensation expense is directly tied to Cruise's equity awards and thus reflects the valuation of Cruise's common stock at the grant date and subsequent accounting treatment.",
        "Hop 3: Cruise \u2190 GM(page_68): GM measures its investment in Cruise using NAV per share as a practical expedient, subject to management review and potential adjustments based on performance and market factors."

GM Financial manages this exposure by maintaining available liquidity that exceeded its internal targets at year-end 2023, supported by a robust credit facility structure totaling $27.0 billion in secured and unsecured capacity. GM itself reports changes in Automotive available liquidity on page 40, which includes cash and credit facilities managed in coordination with GM Financial.

      "answer": "GM recorded a $142 million impairment charge in 2024 for the write-off of technology and intellectual property associated with Cruise, signaling a direct financial loss tied to its autonomous vehicle segment. This aligns with Cruise recording $529 million in restructuring charges in 2023 and additional charges of $631 million in June 2024 and $522 million in December 2024, totaling $1.682 billion. These charges included both cash and non-cash components, with $287 million in cumulative cash outflows already incurred and $389 million expected by the end of 2025.

In conjunction with these actions, Cruise recorded charges before noncontrolling interest of $529 million in the year ended December 31, 2023, which included noncash restructuring charges of $250 million. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed the Cruise Origin and recognized primarily non-cash charges before noncontrolling interest of $631 million. In December 2024, in conjunction with GM's announcement of its decision to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and its plans, subject to approval by the Cruise Board of Directors, to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges before noncontrolling interest of $522 million, which included net non-cash restructuring charges of $173 million. The non-cash restructuring charges are not reflected in the table above. Cumulatively, we have incurred $287 million of cash outflows resulting from these restructuring activities.

      "answer": "GM reports a favorable Price variance of $0.7 billion in its net sales and EBIT-adjusted performance, which contributed to a $2.222 billion increase in EBIT-adjusted year-over-year. This pricing benefit is aligned with the company's strategic emphasis on EBIT-adjusted as the primary metric for evaluating automotive segment profitability and making resource allocation decisions. Despite challenges from unfavorable Mix and foreign currency impacts, the pricing strength helped improve EBIT-adjusted margins from 8.7% to 9.2%, reinforcing the company\u2019s focus on maintaining pricing discipline to support long-term profitability and strategic investments, particularly in areas like EVs and AV technology through Cruise.",

Segment Reporting\n\nOur chief operating decision-maker, who is our Chair and Chief Executive Officer, analyzes the results of our business through the following reportable segments: GMNA, GMI, Cruise and GM Financial. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates the operating results and performance of our automotive segments and Cruise through EBIT-adjusted, which is presented net of noncontrolling interests. Our chief operating decision-maker evaluates GM Financial through EBT-adjusted because interest income and interest expense are an integral part of its operational and financial performance. These financial metrics are used to view operating trends, perform analytical comparisons and benchmark performance between periods and among geographic regions and to monitor budget-to-actual variances on a monthly basis. To manage operations and make decisions regarding resource allocations, our chief operating decision-maker is regularly provided and reviews expense information at a consolidated, functional level for our global purchasing and supply chain, manufacturing and engineering functions. Warranty and quality metrics are also viewed on a consolidated basis. Currently, a focus is being placed on driving an efficient, consolidated fixed cost structure and managing overall global headcount. V ehiclelevel profitability metrics are also reviewed during the planning stage and throughout a program's life cycle on a forecasted basis, and not on an actual basis. Each segment has a manager responsible for executing our strategic initiatives.\n\nSubstantially all of the trucks, crossovers, cars and automobile parts produced are marketed through retail dealers in North America and through distributors and dealers outside of North America, the substantial majority of which are independently owned. In addition to the products sold to dealers for consumer retail sales, trucks, crossovers and cars are also sold to fleet customers, including daily rental car companies, commercial fleet customers, leasing companies and governments. Fleet sales are completed through the dealer network and in some cases directly with fleet customers. Retail and fleet customers can obtain a wide range of after-sale vehicle services and products through the dealer network, such as maintenance, light repairs, collision repairs, vehicle accessories and extended service warranties.\n\nGMNA meets the demands of customers in North America and GMI primarily meets the demands of customers outside North America, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. We also have equity ownership stakes in entities that meet the demands of customers in other countries, primarily  China, with vehicles developed, manufactured and/or marketed under the  Baojun,  Buick,  Cadillac,  Chevrolet and  Wuling brands.  Cruise  is  our  global  segment  responsible  for  the  development  of  AV   technology,  and  includes  AV -related  engineering  and  other  costs.  We  provide automotive financing services through our GM Financial segment.\n\nOur automotive interest income and interest expense, legacy costs from the Opel/V auxhall Business (primarily pension costs), corporate expenditures and certain revenues and expenses that are not part of a reportable segment are recorded centrally in Corporate. Corporate assets primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents, marketable debt securities and intersegment balances. All intersegment balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.",

      "answer": "GM's decision to stop funding Cruise's robotaxi development directly triggered the $522 million in charges recorded by Cruise in December 2024, which included $173 million in non-cash restructuring charges. This decision also led to a broader write-off of Cruise-related assets, evidenced by GM recording a $142 million impairment charge in 2024 related to the write-off of technology and intellectual property associated with Cruise.

      "answer": "The 2% decrease in the Global Brand Divisions' loss before interest and taxes was primarily driven by lower operating overhead expenses, which included reduced technology spending. According to the operating overhead expense section, lower wage-related expenses and technology spend contributed to the decline in overhead costs. This reduction in technology spend directly supported the improvement in the Global Brand Divisions' financial performance despite higher demand creation expenses.",

      "answer": "GM's fleet sales in 2021 totaled 710, down from 844 in 2020, indicating a reduction in large-volume vehicle sales typically associated with rental companies or commercial buyers. Meanwhile, the company's sub-prime financing portfolio (FICO score less than 620) increased to $4,053 million originated in 2021, up from $3,803 million in 2020, representing a growing share of riskier credit profiles. This suggests that while GM reduced its fleet exposure in 2021, it simultaneously took on more consumer-level credit risk by financing a larger volume of sub-prime loans, which could affect delinquency rates and overall financial stability in the context of economic uncertainty.",

      "answer": "In 2023, GMFinancial contributed $12,133 million in net sales and revenue to GM's total consolidated revenue of $171,842 million, representing approximately 7.06%. Of GMFinancial's revenue, $11,035 million came from U.S. operations and $1,725 million from Non-U.S. operations, indicating a strong U.S. focus with Non-U.S. revenue accounting for only about 13.4% of GMFinancial's total. This contrasts with GM's overall geographic revenue mix, where Non-U.S. revenue accounted for $30,186 million, or about 23.7% of total automotive revenue, suggesting that GMFinancial's geographic exposure is more concentrated in the U.S. compared to GM's broader operations.",

      "question": "How does GM's financial reporting of Cruise's net sales and revenue in 2022 reconcile with the significant impairment charges related to Cruise's technology and intellectual property in 2024?",
      "answer": "GM reported Cruise's net sales and revenue for 2022 at $102 million (page_106), indicating a small but active contribution from the autonomous vehicle segment. However, in 2024, GM recorded $142 million in impairment charges specifically tied to the write-off of technology and intellectual property associated with Cruise (page_78). This suggests that despite Cruise generating revenue, the company faced substantial losses in asset value linked to its strategic investments in autonomous driving. The impairment charges indicate that the technology developed or acquired by Cruise did not yield the expected long-term value, which contrasts with the earlier revenue figures and raises questions about the sustainability and strategic alignment of Cruise's operations within GM's broader portfolio.",

      "question": "How does GM Financial's exposure to used vehicle prices through leasing residual values interact with the company's impairment charges in China joint ventures, given the market volatility factors described in the risk section?",
      "answer": "GM Financial's leasing program is directly exposed to used vehicle prices through residual value risk, as evidenced by the $0.8 billion in gains on lease terminations in 2024. This exposure means that fluctuations in used vehicle prices can significantly impact GM Financial's earnings. Meanwhile, GM's China joint ventures faced severe market pressures, including intense competition and weakening demand, leading to $4.4 billion in equity losses for the year, which included $2.1 billion in other-than-temporary impairments. GM Financial itself recorded an additional $0.3 billion impairment on its SAIC-GMAC investment due to these same market conditions. The risk section highlights that used vehicle prices are a key driver of new vehicle demand and overall market volatility. This creates a feedback loop: declining used vehicle prices could further depress new vehicle sales in China, worsening the financial performance of the joint ventures, which in turn could lead to further impairments for GM Financial\u2019s residual value exposure.",

          "chunk_text": "\nSGM is a joint venture we established with Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) (50%). SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nwe believe independent, Chinese automakers are expanding market share and prioritizing production volumes over profitability, with the ability to produce vehicles at costs well below foreign automakers, including our Automotive China JV s. These factors are impacting our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. We are in the late stages of finalizing details with our JV  partners on an agreement regarding certain restructuring actions, which include plant closures and portfolio optimization to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions, and updated business forecasts.\n\nBased on the updated forecast, we determined that the material loss in value of our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), SAIC GM (Shenyang) Norsom Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM Norsom), SAIC GM Dong Y ue Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM DY) and SAIC GM Dong Y ue Powertrain Co., Ltd. (SGM DYPT) was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024 which is included in equity income (loss). Our Automotive China JV s' equity losses also includes non-cash charges of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of the restructuring plan. We expect additional restructuring charges are likely to be incurred in 2025. G oing forward, we will continue to assess our strategy in the Chinese market to maintain presence while prioritizing profitability. In addition, G M Financial also concluded that a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC) existed. Refer to the \"Automotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook' section of this MD&amp;A for discussion of GM Financial's other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 25.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.9 million units for a market share of 3.7% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nCruise Cruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV  technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed development work on the Cruise Origin and recorded restructuring charges of $0.6 billion primarily related to noncash write-offs of Origin assets. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. Refer to Part I, Item 1. Business for a further discussion on Cruise. In conjunction with our announcement to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and our plans to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges of $0.5 billion.  These  charges  primarily  relate  to  anticipated  headcount  reductions  and  impairments  of  real  estate  lease  assets  and  certain intangible assets.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 39% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 42% in the corresponding period in 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing  programs  available  and  competing  third-party  financing  products  in  the  market.  G M  Financial's  prime  loan  originations  as  a  percentage  of  total  loan originations in North America was 81% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 82% in the corresponding period in 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2024, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 46%, retail finance charge income of 40% and commercial finance charge income of 8%.\n\nGM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. G ains on terminations of leased vehicles of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion were included in G M Financial interest, operating and other ex penses in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in gains is primarily due to fewer terminated leases in 2024 compared to 2023. The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent",

Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\n## Risks related to our operations\n\nOur business is highly dependent upon global automobile market sales volume, which can be volatile. Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability  of  affordable  financing,  elevated  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or uncertainty, the occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons, including a moderate to severe recession in any of the markets in which we operate, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials, energy or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, elevated cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials for our EV  propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EV s and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. G eopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic, regulatory and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials, energy and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of  the  largest  global  manufacturers  and  numerous  domestic  manufacturers,  which  have  ex perienced  significant  growth  in  customer  acceptance,  as  well  as  nontraditional  market  participants,  such  as  domestic  technology  companies.  Over  the  last  several  years,  this  intense  competition  and  an  increasingly  challenging operating environment negatively impacted the profitability of our operations in China, our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. As a result, in December 2024, our Board of Directors determined there to be a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JV s. Updated business forecasts and recent restructuring actions to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions have indicated that the loss in value is other-than-temporary for our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), certain SGM subsidiaries and SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC). As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024. We also recorded additional equity losses of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of these restructuring actions, which includes plant closures and portfolio optimization, in the year ended December 31, 2024. These charges are non-cash in nature. We expect SGM will likely incur additional restructuring charges in 2025. We cannot guarantee that the restructuring actions will be successful in our China JV s achieving long-term profitability or that additional, material restructuring actions will not be required.\n\nIn addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EV s, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies while achieving affordability. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China and the unique regulatory landscape in China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions, weakening economic conditions in China or China's level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.",

      "answer": "GM's reliance on GM Financial for $13.3 billion in dealer financing highlights the significant exposure GM has through its financial arm. GM Financial sets aside a $2.3 billion allowance for loan losses, which is determined using forecasted economic conditions such as unemployment rates and GDP growth. This allowance is meant to cover expected credit losses over the life of the receivables, incorporating both historical loss data and forward-looking economic assumptions. The alignment between the $13.3 billion in dealer financing and the $2.3 billion allowance suggests that GM Financial is proactively managing its credit risk by adjusting reserves based on economic forecasts, ensuring that potential defaults from dealers are accounted for in their financial planning.",

      "answer": "GM disclosed that the residual value of leased vehicles at the end of 2024 was $23.5 billion, with depreciation and impairment charges directly tied to changes in estimated residual values. GM Financial, which manages these leases, faces financial exposure if actual vehicle values fall below these estimates. In 2024, GM Financial indeed recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge on its SAIC-GMAC investment, which is partially tied to the residual value risk in the Chinese market. This demonstrates that the residual value assumptions made in leasing directly impact GM Financial\u2019s asset valuations and profitability, especially in international markets where economic and regulatory conditions can significantly affect used vehicle pricing.",

However, since the customer is not obligated to purchase the vehicle at the end of the contract, GM Financial is exposed to a risk of loss to the extent the customer returns the vehicle prior to or at the end of the lease term and the proceeds GM Financial receives on the disposition of the vehicle are lower than the residual value estimated at the inception of the lease. Realization of the residual values is dependent on GM Financial's future ability to market the vehicles under prevailing market conditions.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, the estimated residual value of GM Financial's leased vehicles was $23.5 billion. Depreciation reduces the carrying value of each leased asset in GM Financial's operating lease portfolio over time from its original acquisition value to its ex pected residual value at the end of the lease term. If used vehicle prices weaken compared to estimates, GM Financial would increase depreciation expense and/or record an impairment charge on the lease portfolio. If an impairment exists, GM Financial would determine any shortfall in recoverability of the leased vehicle asset groups by year, make and model. Recoverability is calculated as the excess of: (1)  the  sum  of  remaining  lease  payments  plus  estimated  residual  value;  over  (2)  leased  vehicles,  net  less  deferred  revenue. Alternatively,  if  used  vehicle  prices outperform GM Financial's latest estimates, it may record gains on sales of off-lease vehicles and/or decreased depreciation expense.\n\nThe  following  table  illustrates  the  effect  of  a  1%  relative  change  in  the  estimated  residual  values  at  December  31,  2024,  which  could  increase  or  decrease depreciation expense over the remaining term of the leased vehicle portfolio, holding all other assumptions constant (dollars in millions):\n\n",

These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",

      "answer": "The growth in full-price ASP, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to gross margin expansion due to strategic pricing actions, appears to reflect a deliberate effort to enhance profitability through pricing discipline. However, this strategy is accompanied by an increase in sales-related reserves, rising from $994 million in fiscal 2023 to $1,282 million in fiscal 2024, which includes returns, discounts, and claims. These reserves are directly tied to the NIKE Brand's operating segments, as corporate revenues include foreign currency hedge gains and losses related to the NIKE Brand's geographic segments. This suggests that while pricing actions are boosting margins, they may also be contributing to higher return liabilities or post-sale adjustments, potentially signaling increased risk exposure in revenue predictability or inventory management for the NIKE Brand.",

U.S. industry sales were 15.4 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 3.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic originally resulted in a contraction of total North America industry volumes in 2020 that continued into 2021.

Our outlook is dependent on the pricing environment, continuing improvement of the semiconductor supply shortage and overall economic conditions. As a  result  of  the  semiconductor  supply  shortage,  we  experienced  interruptions  to  our  planned  production schedules  and  temporarily  suspended  certain  manufacturing  sites  to  prioritize  production  of  our  most  popular  and  in-demand products,  including  our  full-size  trucks  and  full-size  SUVs.  Additionally,  we  have  been  manufacturing  vehicles,  without  the impacted components, representing an inventory carrying value of approximately $0.6 billion at December 31, 2021. We expect to hold these vehicles in our inventory until they are completed and sold to our dealers, which we expect to happen in the six months ending June 30, 2022.\n\nGMI Industry sales  in  China  were  25.9  million  units  in  the  year  ended  December  31,  2021,  representing  an  increase  of  3.8% compared to the corresponding period in 2020, which was adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our total vehicle sales in China were 2.9 million units resulting in a market share of 11.2% in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing a decrease of 0.5 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The ongoing global semiconductor supply shortage, macroeconomic impact of COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions continue to place pressure on China's automotive industry and our vehicle sales in China. Our Automotive China JVs generated equity income of $1.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2021. Although price  competition,  higher  costs  associated  with  commodities  and  raw  materials,  and  a  more  challenging  regulatory  environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV requirements will place pressure on our operations in China, we will continue to build upon our strong brands, network, and partnerships in China as well as drive improvements in vehicle mix and cost.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 23.0 million units in the year ended December 31, 2021, representing an increase of 8.2% compared to the corresponding period in 2020.

Any current or future regulations in these areas could impede the successful commercialization of these technologies and impact whether and how these technologies are designed and integrated into our products, and may ultimately subject us to increased costs and uncertainty.\n\nWe  could  be  materially  adversely  affected  by  unusual  or  significant  litigation,  governmental  investigations  or  other proceedings. We are subject to legal proceedings in the U.S. and elsewhere involving various issues, including product liability lawsuits, warranty litigation, class action litigations alleging product defects, emissions litigation, stockholder litigation, labor and employment litigation and claims and actions arising from restructurings and divestitures of operations and assets. In addition, we are subject to governmental proceedings and investigations. A negative outcome in one or more of these legal proceedings could result  in  the  imposition  of  damages,  including  punitive  damages,  fines,  reputational  harm,  civil  lawsuits  and  criminal  penalties, interruptions of business, modification of business practices, equitable remedies and other sanctions against us or our personnel as well  as  legal  and  other  costs,  all  of  which  may  be  significant.  For  a  further  discussion  of  these  matters  refer  to  Note  16  to  our consolidated financial statements.\n\nThe costs and effect on our reputation of product safety recalls and alleged defects in products and services could materially adversely affect our business. Government safety standards require manufacturers to remedy certain product safety defects through recall campaigns and vehicle repurchases. Under these standards, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties or may incur various costs, including significant costs for repairs made at no cost to the consumer. The costs we incur in connection with these recalls typically include the cost of the part being replaced and labor to remove and replace the defective part. The costs to complete a  recall  could  be  exacerbated  to  the  extent  that  such  action  relates  to  a  global  platform,  such  as  the  Chevrolet  Bolt  EV  recall. Concerns about the safety of our products, including advanced technologies like AVs, whether raised internally or by regulators or consumer advocates, and whether or not based on scientific evidence or supported by data, can result in product delays, recalls, field actions, lost sales, governmental investigations, regulatory action, private claims, lawsuits and settlements and reputational damage. These circumstances can also result in damage to brand image, brand equity and consumer trust in our products and ability to lead the disruption occurring in the automotive industry.\n\nWe currently source a variety of systems, components, raw materials and parts from third parties. From time to time these items may have performance or quality issues that could harm our reputation and cause us to incur significant costs, particularly if the affected items relate to global platforms or involve defects that are identified years after production. Our ability to recover costs associated with recalls or other campaigns caused by parts or components purchased from suppliers may be limited by the suppliers' financial condition or a number of other reasons or defenses.\n\nWe  may  incur  additional  tax  expense  or  become  subject  to  additional  tax  exposure. We  are  subject  to  the  tax  laws  and regulations of the U.S. and numerous other jurisdictions in which we do business. Many judgments are required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities, and we are regularly under audit by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, which may not agree with our tax positions. In addition, our tax liabilities are subject to other significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  those  arising  from  potential  changes  in  laws  and  regulations  in  the  countries  in  which  we  do business,  the  possibility  of  adverse  determinations  with  respect  to  the  application  of  existing  laws,  changes  in  our  business  or structure  and  changes  in  the  valuation  of  our  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities.  Any  unfavorable  resolution  of  these  and  other uncertainties may have a significant adverse impact on our tax rate and results of operations. If our tax expense were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our operating results, cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\n## Risks related to Automotive Financing - GM Financial\n\nWe rely on GM Financial to provide financial services to our customers and dealers. GM Financial faces a number of business, economic and financial risks that could impair its access to capital and negatively affect its business and operations, which in turn could impede its ability to provide leasing and financing to customers and commercial lending to our dealers. Any reduction in GM Financial's ability to provide such financial services would negatively affect our efforts to support additional sales of our vehicles and expand our market penetration among customers and dealers.\n\nThe primary factors that could adversely affect GM Financial's business and operations and reduce its ability to provide financing services  at  competitive  rates  include  the  sufficiency,  availability  and  cost  of  sources  of  financing,  including  credit  facilities, securitization programs and secured and unsecured debt issuances; the performance of loans and leases in its portfolio, which could be materially affected by charge-offs, delinquencies and prepayments; wholesale auction values of used vehicles; vehicle return rates and  the  residual  value  performance  on  vehicles  GM  Financial  leases  to  customers;  fluctuations  in  interest  rates  and  currencies; competition  for  customers  from  commercial  banks,  credit  unions  and  other  financing  and  leasing  companies;  and  changes  to regulation, supervision, enforcement and licensing across various jurisdictions.",

      "question": "How does GM Financial's allowance methodology for retail finance receivables align with the reported delinquency rates and dealer floorplan financing balances, and what does this suggest about their credit risk exposure?",
      "answer": "GM Financial utilizes static pool modeling techniques supplemented by management judgment to determine the allowance for loan losses on retail finance receivables, incorporating forecasts of economic conditions like unemployment rates and GDP growth (page 72). This methodology is applied against a backdrop where 2.8% of retail finance receivables were more than 30 days delinquent as of December 31, 2022 (page 73). Simultaneously, GM Financial held $13.3 billion in dealer floorplan financing as of December 31, 2023, which is subject to different allowance determinations based on historical loss experience and forecasted auto industry conditions (page 72). The alignment suggests GM Financial maintains a differentiated risk management approach for retail versus commercial credit exposure, with specific attention to macroeconomic factors impacting retail customers.",

      "answer": "The NIKE Brand's full-price ASP increase, which contributed approximately 200 basis points to gross margin expansion, reflects strategic pricing actions and a shift toward higher-margin NIKE Direct sales. However, this pricing power did not translate into strong top-line growth in the North America region, where NIKE Direct revenues only increased by 1%, driven by new store additions but offset by a decline in digital sales and flat comparable store sales. This suggests that while NIKE was able to raise prices and improve margins, consumer demand elasticity or competitive pressures limited the volume growth necessary to significantly boost revenues in key retail channels.",

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of September 29, 2024, and October 1, 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended September 29, 2024, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of September 29, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated November 20, 2024, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\n\n## Basis for Opinion\n\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Ex change Commission and the PCAOB.\n\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n\n## Critical Audit Matter\n\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the Audit and Compliance Committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n\n## Goodwill Impairment Assessments for China Reporting Unit - Refer to Note 8 to the financial statements\n\n## Critical Audit Matter Description\n\nThe Company's goodwill for its China reporting unit within the international segment is tested annually for impairment during the third quarter of each year, and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company's evaluation of goodwill for impairment involves comparing the estimated fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value. The estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using both income and market approaches, combined with an equal weighting.\n\nThe income approach is based on discounted future cash flows and requires significant assumptions, including estimates regarding future revenue and cash flow projections, and discount rates. The market approach is based on comparable company multiples (revenue and 'EBITDA,' which stands for earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization) and requires an estimate of multiples derived from comparable publicly traded companies to the reporting unit. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on either the fair value, the amount of any goodwill impairment charge, if any, or both.\n\nThe goodwill balance was $3,315.7 million as of September 29, 2024, of which $2,788.5 million was allocated to the international segment, inclusive of the China reporting unit. The fair value of the China reporting unit was greater than its carrying value as of the measurement date, and as a result, management did not record an impairment charge related to the reporting unit goodwill.",

      "answer": "GM's exposure to used vehicle price volatility directly affects GM Financial's residual value risk, as GM Financial's leasing program is heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. This is evident from the $0.8 billion in gains on terminations of leased vehicles in 2024, which decreased from $0.9 billion in 2023 due to fewer lease terminations. This sensitivity to used vehicle prices impacts the residual value assumptions GM Financial must make when managing its leasing portfolio. In the context of the Chinese market, GM Financial recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge related to its SAIC-GMAC investment, which is tied to the broader challenges in China, including intense competition and weakening economic conditions. These impairments, combined with the volatility in used vehicle prices, amplify the residual value risk for GM Financial, as lower used vehicle prices reduce gains from lease terminations and may lead to further impairments, negatively affecting profitability.",

Because we have a high proportion of relatively fixed structural costs, small changes in sales volume can have a disproportionately large effect on our profitability. A number of economic and market conditions drive changes in new vehicle sales, including disruptions in the new vehicle supply chain, the availability and prices of used vehicles, levels of unemployment and inflation, availability  of  affordable  financing,  elevated  interest  rates,  fluctuations  in  the  cost  of  fuel,  consumer  confidence  and  demand  for  vehicles,  political  unrest  or uncertainty, the occurrence of a public health crisis, barriers to trade and other global economic conditions. For a discussion of economic and market trends, see the \"Overview\" section in Part II, Item 7. MD&amp;A. If our operating environment deteriorates for these or other reasons, including a moderate to severe recession in any of the markets in which we operate, it could lead to a significant decrease in new vehicle sales, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nInflationary pressures and persistently high prices and uncertain availability of commodities, raw materials or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, or instability in logistics and related costs, could negatively impact our profitability. Increases in prices, including as a result of inflation and rising interest rates, for commodities, raw materials, energy or other inputs that we and our suppliers use in manufacturing products, systems, components and parts, such as steel, precious metals, non-ferrous metals, critical minerals or other similar raw materials, or increases in logistics and related costs, have led and may continue to lead to higher production costs for parts, components and vehicles. In addition, elevated cost, or reduced availability, of critical materials for our EV  propulsion systems, including lithium, nickel, cobalt and certain rare earth metals, could lead to higher production costs for our EV s and could impede our ability to successfully deliver on our EV strategy. Further, increasing global demand for, and uncertain supply of, such materials could disrupt our or our suppliers' ability to obtain such materials in a timely manner and/or could lead to increased costs. G eopolitical risk, fluctuations in supply and demand, fluctuations in interest rates, any weakening of the U.S. dollar and other economic, regulatory and political factors have created and may continue to create pricing pressure for commodities, raw materials, energy and other inputs. These inflationary pressures could, in turn, negatively impact our profitability because we may not be able to pass all of those costs on to our customers or require our suppliers to absorb such costs.\n\nOur business in China subjects us to unique operational, competitive and regulatory risks. Our business in China is subject to aggressive competition from many of  the  largest  global  manufacturers  and  numerous  domestic  manufacturers,  which  have  ex perienced  significant  growth  in  customer  acceptance,  as  well  as  nontraditional  market  participants,  such  as  domestic  technology  companies.  Over  the  last  several  years,  this  intense  competition  and  an  increasingly  challenging operating environment negatively impacted the profitability of our operations in China, our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. As a result, in December 2024, our Board of Directors determined there to be a material loss in value of our investments in certain of the China JV s. Updated business forecasts and recent restructuring actions to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions have indicated that the loss in value is other-than-temporary for our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), certain SGM subsidiaries and SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC). As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024. We also recorded additional equity losses of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of these restructuring actions, which includes plant closures and portfolio optimization, in the year ended December 31, 2024. These charges are non-cash in nature. We expect SGM will likely incur additional restructuring charges in 2025. We cannot guarantee that the restructuring actions will be successful in our China JV s achieving long-term profitability or that additional, material restructuring actions will not be required.\n\nIn addition, our success in China depends upon our ability to adequately address unique market and consumer preferences driven by advancements related to EV s, infotainment, software-enabled connected services and other new technologies while achieving affordability. Our ability to fully deploy our technologies in China may be impacted by evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and China and the unique regulatory landscape in China. Increased competition, continued U.S.-China trade tensions, weakening economic conditions in China or China's level of integration with key components in our global supply chain, among other factors, may result in cost increases, price reductions, reduced sales, profitability and margins, and challenges to gaining or holding market share.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## GENERAL MOTORS COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\nwe believe independent, Chinese automakers are expanding market share and prioritizing production volumes over profitability, with the ability to produce vehicles at costs well below foreign automakers, including our Automotive China JV s. These factors are impacting our China JV s' ability to grow vehicle sales in China and our ability to generate sustainable equity income from our China JV s. We are in the late stages of finalizing details with our JV  partners on an agreement regarding certain restructuring actions, which include plant closures and portfolio optimization to address continuing market challenges and competitive conditions, and updated business forecasts.\n\nBased on the updated forecast, we determined that the material loss in value of our equity interests in SAIC G eneral Motors Corporation Limited (SGM), SAIC GM (Shenyang) Norsom Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM Norsom), SAIC GM Dong Y ue Motors Co., Ltd. (SGM DY) and SAIC GM Dong Y ue Powertrain Co., Ltd. (SGM DYPT) was other than temporary. As a result, we recorded an other-than-temporary impairment of our equity interests of $2.1 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024 which is included in equity income (loss). Our Automotive China JV s' equity losses also includes non-cash charges of $2.0 billion resulting from the implementation of the restructuring plan. We expect additional restructuring charges are likely to be incurred in 2025. G oing forward, we will continue to assess our strategy in the Chinese market to maintain presence while prioritizing profitability. In addition, G M Financial also concluded that a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC Automotive Finance Company Limited (SAIC-GMAC) existed. Refer to the \"Automotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook' section of this MD&amp;A for discussion of GM Financial's other-than-temporary impairment of its equity interest in SAIC-GMAC.\n\nOutside of China, industry sales were 25.7 million units in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3% compared to the corresponding period in 2023. Our total vehicle sales outside of China were 0.9 million units for a market share of 3.7% in the year ended December 31, 2024, representing a decrease of 0.3 percentage points compared to the corresponding period in 2023.\n\nCruise Cruise Holdings, our majority-owned subsidiary, has been pursuing the development and commercialization of AV  technology for deployment in a robotaxi application. In June 2024, Cruise indefinitely delayed development work on the Cruise Origin and recorded restructuring charges of $0.6 billion primarily related to noncash write-offs of Origin assets. In December 2024, we announced plans to refocus our autonomous driving strategy on personal vehicles and that we would no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work. Refer to Part I, Item 1. Business for a further discussion on Cruise. In conjunction with our announcement to no longer fund Cruise's robotaxi development work and our plans to combine the Cruise and GM technical efforts to advance autonomous and assisted driving, Cruise recorded net charges of $0.5 billion.  These  charges  primarily  relate  to  anticipated  headcount  reductions  and  impairments  of  real  estate  lease  assets  and  certain intangible assets.\n\nAutomotive Financing - GM Financial Summary and Outlook We believe that offering a comprehensive suite of financing products will generate incremental sales of our vehicles, drive incremental GM Financial earnings and help support our sales throughout various economic cycles. GM Financial's penetration of our retail sales in the U.S. was 39% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 42% in the corresponding period in 2023. Penetration levels vary depending on incentive financing  programs  available  and  competing  third-party  financing  products  in  the  market.  G M  Financial's  prime  loan  originations  as  a  percentage  of  total  loan originations in North America was 81% in the year ended December 31, 2024 and 82% in the corresponding period in 2023. In the year ended December 31, 2024, GM Financial's revenue consisted of leased vehicle income of 46%, retail finance charge income of 40% and commercial finance charge income of 8%.\n\nGM Financial's leasing program is exposed to residual values, which are heavily dependent on used vehicle prices. G ains on terminations of leased vehicles of $0.8 billion and $0.9 billion were included in G M Financial interest, operating and other ex penses in the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The decrease in gains is primarily due to fewer terminated leases in 2024 compared to 2023. The following table summarizes the estimated residual value based on GM Financial's most recent",

SGM has interests in three other joint ventures in China: SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT. These three joint ventures are jointly held by SGM (50%), SAIC (25%) and ourselves. These four joint ventures are engaged in the production, import and sale of a range of products under the Buick, Chevrolet and Cadillac brands. SGM also has interests in Shanghai OnStar (20%), SAIC-GMAC (20%) and SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd. (20%). Shanghai Automotive Group Finance Company Ltd., a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMAC. SAIC Financial Holdings Company, a subsidiary of SAIC, owns 45% of SAIC-GMF Leasing Co., Ltd.\n\nImpairment  Charges Our Automotive China JVs generated an equity loss of $4.4 billion in the year ended December 31, 2024, which includes $2.0 billion of impairments and restructuring-related charges recorded by certain of the China JV s and a $2.1 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down certain of our automotive investments to their fair values. In response to intense competition in a market with significant excess capacity and an increasingly challenging regulatory environment related to emissions, fuel consumption and NEV s, we and our JV  partners are restructuring our operations in China. The charges recorded by the  China  JV s  were  primarily  related  to  asset  impairments  associated  with  plant  closures  and  portfolio  optimization  actions  and  the  recognition  of  a  valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. As a result of the market challenges and competitive conditions, GM Financial also recorded a $0.3 billion other-than-temporary impairment charge to write down its SAIC-GMAC investment to its fair value.\n\nFair  Value  Measurements In  performing  our  impairment  testing,  we  utilize  a  third-party  valuation  specialist  to  assist  in  determining  the  fair  values  of  our investments based on valuation techniques using the best available information. The fair values of the investments in the China JV s are estimated based on their discounted cash flows (income approach). We make significant assumptions and estimates about the extent and timing of future cash flows, growth rates, market share and discount rates that represent unobservable, Level 3, inputs into our valuation methodologies. Where available and as appropriate, comparative market multiples are used to corroborate the results of the discounted cash flow method.\n\nThe investment balance for SGM, SGM Norsom, SGM DY and SGM DYPT that was tested for impairment was $2.4 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in  our  impairment  testing  were: 16.5%  discount  rate; 0.5%  long-term  growth  rate;  passenger  vehicle  industry  volumes  of 23.3-24.0 million and a market share of 2.0-2.2% in 2024 through 2028. The investment balance for SAIC-GMAC that was tested for impairment was $1.5 billion and the estimated key assumptions utilized in our impairment testing were: 13.0% discount rate; 3.5% long-term growth rate; and alignment with the Automotive China JVs on vehicle volumes and market share.\n\nThe discount rate considered various factors including bond yields, cost of equity, risk premiums and tax rates; the terminal values were determined using a growth model that applied an investee's long-term growth rate to its projected cash flows beyond the forecast period; and industry volumes and market share included annual estimates through the forecast period. In addition, minimum operating cash needs that incorporate specific business, economic and regulatory factors giving rise to varying cash needs were estimated. Our fair value estimates assume the achievement of the future financial results",
