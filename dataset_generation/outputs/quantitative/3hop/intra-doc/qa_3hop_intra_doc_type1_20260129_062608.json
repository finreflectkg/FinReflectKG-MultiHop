      "question": "How does the 2% volume growth reported in the APAC segment contribute to the overall negative 1% volume impact on consolidated sales, as shown in the factors contributing to sales changes?",
      "answer": "The APAC segment reported a 2% increase in volume during 2023, driven by project start-ups in the electronics and chemicals and energy end markets. However, this positive contribution at the segment level contrasts with the overall negative 1% impact of volume on consolidated sales when viewed across Linde\u2019s global operations. This discrepancy indicates that while the APAC region experienced volume growth, other geographic or business segments likely saw volume declines significant enough to result in an overall negative volume impact company-wide. The specific contrast between the APAC segment's 2% volume growth and the consolidated -1% volume effect highlights the uneven regional performance and differing demand dynamics across Linde\u2019s global markets.",

This aligns with the Executive Summary, which states that lower volumes had an adverse impact on operating profit company-wide, despite the overall 49% increase in reported operating profit.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "The APAC segment reported an 8% increase in operating profit ($136 million) driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which offset currency and cost inflation impacts. In contrast, the Americas segment saw a 14% increase in operating profit ($512 million), attributed to higher pricing, acquisitions (such as nexAir, LLC), and productivity gains that outpaced cost inflation. This comparison highlights that while both regions benefited from pricing and productivity, the Americas experienced a significantly stronger profit growth, partly due to acquisition activity, suggesting a more aggressive expansion and integration strategy in the Americas compared to APAC.",

The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "Higher pricing was a key driver in both the Americas segment and the overall company performance. In the Americas, higher pricing contributed to a $306 million (7%) increase in operating profit, as noted on page 26. At the consolidated level, page 21 indicates that higher pricing was a primary factor behind the $611 million (8%) increase in reported operating profit. This shows that pricing played a consistent and significant role across both regional and company-wide results, though the Americas alone accounted for nearly half of the total operating profit growth. The alignment between segment and consolidated reporting underscores pricing as a strategic lever for profitability growth in 2024.",

      "question": "How does Linde's exclusion of restructuring charges from segment operating profit impact the interpretation of the APAC segment's 18% operating profit growth, given the capital expenditure allocation to the region in 2021?",
      "answer": "Linde excludes restructuring charges from its management definition of segment operating profit, which means the APAC segment's reported 18% increase in operating profit does not include the impact of these charges. This exclusion could make the APAC segment's performance appear stronger than it might be on a fully inclusive basis. At the same time, the APAC segment received 32% of the company's total $3,086 million in capital expenditures in 2021, indicating significant investment in growth initiatives in the region. The combination of excluding charges and highlighting strong operating profit growth may present a more favorable view of the APAC segment's performance, while the capital investment suggests ongoing strategic emphasis despite any underlying restructuring costs.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "question": "How does Linde's explanation of lower volumes reducing sales by 1% globally reconcile with the 14% and 23% increases in operating profit reported in the Americas and EMEA segments, respectively?",
      "answer": "Linde reported in its global financial results (page 21) that lower volumes reduced sales by 1% in 2023. However, in the Americas segment (page 29), operating profit increased by 14%, driven by higher pricing and acquisitions, while EMEA (page 30) reported a 23% increase in operating profit, despite lower volumes decreasing sales by 4% in that region. This indicates that while lower volumes had a negative impact on sales, strong pricing strategies and productivity initiatives were able to offset these effects and drive operating profit growth across both segments. The disconnect between volume-driven sales declines and operating profit growth highlights the effectiveness of Linde's pricing and cost management strategies in mitigating volume pressures.",

      "answer": "The 14% increase in Operating Profit in the Americas segment was driven by higher pricing, acquisitions (notably nexAir, LLC), and productivity initiatives, which more than offset cost inflation. In contrast, the 8% increase in Operating Profit in the APAC segment was primarily driven by pricing and productivity, despite headwinds from currency translation (weakening of the Australian dollar, Indian rupee, and Chinese Yuan) and cost inflation. This comparison suggests that while both regions benefited from pricing and productivity, the Americas had an additional boost from acquisitions, highlighting a more robust regional operating performance in the Americas compared to APAC in 2023.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "answer": "Linde reported an overall increase in operating profit of $611 million in 2024, with higher pricing being a primary driver. This aligns with the EMEA segment's operating profit growth of $294 million (12% increase), which was also attributed to higher pricing. However, while the EMEA segment saw pricing contribute positively despite a 2% decline in sales volume, the overall company growth in operating profit suggests that pricing strategies were effective across multiple segments, including the Americas, where productivity and supplier settlements also played a role. The synthesis reveals that pricing was a consistent lever across regions, contributing significantly to the consolidated operating profit growth despite mixed volume performance.",

A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "Linde reported an overall operating profit increase of $611 million (8%) for 2024, driven by pricing and productivity gains, despite cost inflation and currency pressures. Within this, the APAC segment specifically contributed $112 million (6%) of the operating profit growth, primarily through volume increases and productivity improvements, which offset the negative impact of currency translation\u2014particularly the weakening of the Korean won and Chinese yuan. This indicates that while APAC faced regional currency challenges, its operational performance helped support the company's broader profitability gains. The reconciliation shows that APAC was a meaningful contributor to the overall operating profit growth despite external macroeconomic pressures.",

      "question": "How does the increase in intersegment sales from the Helium segment to the Industrial Gases segment in 2024 reconcile with the reported decline in underlying sales in the Helium segment due to lower volumes?",
      "answer": "In 2024, intersegment sales from the Helium segment to the Industrial Gases segment amounted to $477 million, reflecting a meaningful flow of products between these segments. However, the Helium segment itself reported a 2% decline in underlying sales, primarily driven by lower volumes in global helium. This apparent contradiction can be reconciled by understanding that while Helium's external sales declined due to volume pressures, its internal sales to the Industrial Gases segment increased compared to the prior year ($477 million in 2024 vs. $509 million in 2023). This suggests that the Industrial Gases segment may have absorbed more helium supply internally, potentially offsetting some of the external market weakness. The Helium segment also experienced higher costs, which were partially offset by an insurance recovery, indicating operational pressures despite the increased intersegment activity.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "answer": "Linde's APAC segment operating profit increased by 6% ($112 million) in 2024, driven by volume growth from project start-ups and productivity initiatives, which offset currency headwinds and cost inflation. This segment-level performance contributed to the company's overall operating profit growth of 8% ($611 million) on a reported basis. However, the consolidated operating profit growth was also influenced by pricing improvements and productivity savings across other segments, which similarly countered broader currency and inflationary pressures. The APAC segment's 6% growth, while slightly below the company-wide 8%, still reflects a significant contribution to the overall operating profit increase, despite facing a stronger headwind from currency translation (weakening of the Korean won and Chinese yuan) and cost inflation.",

Cost pass-through increased sales by 1% with minimal impact on operating profit. Pricing was flat.\n\n## Operating Profit\n\nOperating profit in the APAC segment increased $112 million, or 6%, in 2024 versus 2023.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOn a reported basis, operating profit increased $611 million in 2024, or 8%.  The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

      "question": "How does Linde's exclusion of restructuring charges from segment operating profit in the consolidated financial statements impact the interpretation of the APAC segment's $225 million increase in operating profit, given that capital expenditures for this segment accounted for 32% of total company spending in 2021?",
      "answer": "Linde excludes restructuring charges from its management definition of segment operating profit, as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements (page 62), which means the APAC segment\u2019s $225 million increase in operating profit excludes any impact from these charges. However, the APAC segment\u2019s operating performance is also tied to its capital investment, with 32% of the company\u2019s $3,086 million in total capital expenditures in 2021 allocated to this region. This suggests that the APAC segment\u2019s profitability growth was supported by significant investment in new plant and production equipment, even as the deconsolidation of a joint venture in Taiwan reduced operating profit by $126 million. Therefore, the reported operating profit growth in APAC reflects both strong underlying performance and strategic investment, but is somewhat insulated from restructuring costs that may affect consolidated results.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.

Volumes increased 11% driven by increased demand across all end markets, led by cyclical end markets and electronics and project start-us. Higher price increased sales by 2%. Currency translation increased sales by 5% driven primarily by the strengthening of the Chinese yuan, Australian dollar and Korean won against the U.S. dollar. Cost pass-through increased sales by 2% with minimal impact on operating profit. Divestitures decreased sales by 12% primarily due to the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in Taiwan which decreased sales by $639 million (See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Operating Profit\n\nOperating profit in the APAC segment increased $225 million, or 18%, in 2021 versus 2020. Higher volumes and price, and continued productivity initiatives were partially offset by a $126 million reduction due to the deconsolidation of the joint venture with operations in Taiwan.",

The increase was primarily driven by higher pricing and savings from productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation, cost reduction program and other charges and currency.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of merger-related purchase accounting as well as cost reduction program and other charges, operating profit increased $650 million, or 7%, for 2024 versus 2023. Operating profit growth was driven by higher pricing and productivity initiatives, which more than offset the effects of cost inflation and currency during 2024. A discussion of operating profit by segment is included in the segment discussion that follows.\n\n## Interest expense - net\n\nReported interest expense - net in 2024 increased $56 million, or 28%, versus 2023. The increase was driven primarily by higher outstanding borrowings due to net issuances in 2024 and higher interest rates on borrowings.\n\n## Net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost\n\nReported net pension and OPEB cost (benefit), excluding service cost were benefits of $190 million and $164 million in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The increase was driven primarily by a higher expected return on assets and lower interest cost due to decrease in benefit obligations, partially offset by lower amortization of deferred gains year-over-year. (see Note 16 to the consolidated financial statements).\n\n## Effective tax rate\n\nThe reported effective tax rate (\"ETR\") for 2024 was 23.4% versus 22.7% in 2023. The increase in the rate is primarily related to a prior year benefit from a net decrease in the company's uncertain tax positions. On an adjusted basis, the ETR for 2024 was 23.4% versus 23.6% in 2023.\n\n## Income from equity investments\n\nReported income from equity investments for 2024 was $170 million as compared to $167 million in 2023. On an adjusted basis, income from equity investments for 2024 was $242 million versus $239 million million in 2023.\n\n## Noncontrolling interests\n\nAt  December  31,  2024,  noncontrolling  interests  consisted  primarily  of  noncontrolling  shareholders'  investments  in  APAC  (primarily  in  China).  Reported noncontrolling interests increased $30 million, from $142 million in 2023 to $172 million in 2024 and included the impact of a divestiture in the APAC segment.\n\nAdjusted noncontrolling interests increased $14 million in 2024 as compared to 2023.\n\n## Net Income - Linde plc\n\nReported net income - Linde plc increased $366 million, or 6%. On an adjusted basis, which excludes the impacts of purchase accounting and cost reduction program and other charges, net income - Linde plc increased $486 million, or 7%, in 2024 versus 2023. On both a reported and adjusted basis, the increase was driven by higher operating profit.\n\n## Diluted earnings per share\n\nReported diluted earnings per share increased $1.03, or 8%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. On an adjusted basis, diluted EPS of $15.51 in 2024 increased $1.31 versus 2023. The increase on both a reported and adjusted basis is primarily due to higher net income - Linde plc and lower diluted shares outstanding.\n\n## Employees\n\nThe number of employees at December 31, 2024 was 65,289, a decrease of 2%, or 1,034 employees from 2023, driven primarily by the impact of cost reduction programs and a divestiture in APAC.\n\n## Other Financial Data\n\nEBITDA increased to $12,585 million in 2024 from $12,007 million in 2023. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $12,819 million for 2024 as compared to $12,133 million in 2023. The increase in both periods was driven by higher operating profit versus prior year.\n\nSee the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section for definitions and reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to reported GAAP amounts.\n\n## Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n\nOther comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2024 was a loss of $1,126 million that resulted primarily from currency translation adjustments of $1,632  million  partially  offset  by  gains  related  to  change  in  funded  status  of  retirement  plans  of  $519  million.  The  translation  adjustments  reflect  the  impact  of translating local currency",

In contrast, the Americas segment saw a much larger $512 million (14%) increase in operating profit, driven by pricing, acquisitions (notably nexAir, LLC), and productivity, despite cost pass-through having a more notable effect on sales.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "question": "How should an analyst interpret the $225 million increase in APAC segment operating profit when considering both the exclusion of restructuring charges from segment reporting and the $989 million of capital expenditures allocated to the APAC region in 2021?",
      "answer": "An analyst should interpret the $225 million increase in APAC segment operating profit with the understanding that it excludes restructuring charges, which are separately disclosed in consolidated operating profit. According to the segment reporting note, Linde excludes these charges from its management definition of segment operating profit, meaning the APAC growth figure does not reflect potential costs associated with operational reorganization or asset reductions. At the same time, the APAC segment received $989 million (32% of total capital expenditures) in 2021, signaling significant investment in new plant and production equipment for growth. This suggests that the operating profit growth may be partly attributable to these capital investments, even though the segment profit metric excludes restructuring costs. Therefore, while the APAC segment appears to have delivered strong operating profit growth, the exclusion of restructuring charges and the substantial capital investment should be factored into any assessment of the segment\u2019s underlying performance and capital efficiency.",

As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "question": "How does Linde's capital expenditure allocation in the APAC segment relate to the reported increase in segment operating profit, considering how these charges are treated in the consolidated financial statements?",
      "answer": "Linde allocated 32% of its $3,086 million capital expenditures to the APAC segment in 2021, primarily for investments in new plant and production equipment aimed at supporting growth. This capital allocation aligns with the $225 million (18%) increase in APAC segment operating profit in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by higher volumes, pricing, and productivity initiatives. However, the consolidated financial statements treat certain charges as separate line items within operating profit, which Linde excludes from its management definition of segment operating profit, as noted in the Segment Information (Note 18). This distinction means that while the APAC segment reported strong operating profit growth, the consolidated income statement reflects additional charges that are not included in the segment-level results. The capital investments appear to be contributing to segment-level profitability, but analysts must consider that consolidated operating profit includes charges that could affect overall earnings.",

      "answer": "The APAC segment reported an 18% increase in operating profit in 2021, which included a $126 million reduction due to the deconsolidation of a joint venture in Taiwan. However, restructuring charges were excluded from the management definition of segment operating profit, as disclosed in the consolidated financial statements on page 62. This exclusion implies that certain costs related to strategic changes or operational adjustments were not factored into the segment-level profitability metric used internally, potentially presenting a more favorable view of operating performance. Meanwhile, the APAC segment received 32% of the company\u2019s $3,086 million in capital expenditures during 2021, amounting to approximately $987.5 million, primarily directed toward new plant and production equipment for growth initiatives. Therefore, the 18% profit growth must be interpreted in the context of both the exclusion of restructuring charges and the significant capital investment in the region, which together suggest that the operating profit growth was supported by both cost management and strategic asset deployment.",

The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

Meanwhile, the company invested $988 million (32% of total $3,086 million capital expenditures) in the APAC region during 2021, signaling strategic growth intent despite the segment-level impact from divestitures.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

Cost pass-through increased sales by 2% with minimal impact on operating profit.

      "question": "How does the exclusion of restructuring charges from segment operating profit impact the interpretation of the APAC segment's 18% operating profit growth, especially considering the $3,086 million capital expenditures in 2021, with 32% allocated to the APAC segment?",
      "answer": "The exclusion of restructuring charges from segment operating profit (as noted on page 62) suggests that the APAC segment's 18% operating profit growth (reported on page 30) reflects core operational performance, excluding one-time or non-recurring charges. This interpretation is further contextualized by the capital expenditure data from page 34, which shows that $3,086 million was invested company-wide in 2021, with 32% specifically allocated to the APAC segment. This significant investment likely contributed to the APAC segment's strong operating profit growth through new plant and production capabilities that enhanced capacity and efficiency. Therefore, the combination of excluding restructuring charges and directing meaningful capital investment toward APAC indicates that the reported operating profit growth is both a result of strategic investment and a management-defined metric that emphasizes sustainable, ongoing operations rather than including one-time impacts.",
