      "question": "How does the Sports segment's reliance on subscription fees as a key revenue source contrast with the risks outlined in the risk factors section regarding competitive pressures affecting pricing for DTC offerings and linear networks?",
      "answer": "The Sports segment generates a significant portion of its revenue from subscription fees, as outlined in the segment reporting section (page 38). However, the risk factors section (page 23) highlights that competitive pressures from alternative entertainment platforms and streaming services are reducing or limiting growth in prices for both DTC offerings and linear networks, directly impacting the ability to increase or maintain subscription fees. This creates a tension between the Sports segment's revenue strategy and the external market forces that could constrain its pricing power and profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Increased competitive pressures impact our revenues, increase our costs and impact the profitability of our businesses.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

      "answer": "The Sports segment generates revenue from multiple streams including affiliate fees, advertising, subscription fees, pay-per-view fees, and sub-licensing of sports rights. Advertising, which grew by 14% year-over-year to $3,707 million, represents a significant component of the Sports segment\u2019s revenue model. This growth in advertising revenue aligns with the segment\u2019s role as a content provider, where live sports and sports-related programming attract high viewership and premium ad rates. The Sports segment\u2019s reliance on advertising, alongside other revenue sources like affiliate fees and subscriptions, underscores its diversified monetization strategy. This diversification helps mitigate risk and supports the segment\u2019s strategic positioning in the broader media ecosystem.",

Unless presented separately, the impairment charge is included as a component of depreciation expense.\n\nCertain of our cable franchise agreements and lease agreements contain provisions requiring us to restore facilities or remove property in the event that the franchise or lease agreement is not renewed. We expect to continually renew our cable franchise agreements and therefore cannot reasonably estimate liabilities associated with such agreements. A remote possibility exists that franchise agreements could be terminated unexpectedly, which could result in us incurring significant expense in complying with restoration or removal provisions. We do not have any material liabilities related to asset retirement obligations recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

When multiple segments enter into transactions to  provide products and services to third parties, revenue is generally allocated to our segments based on relative value. The most significant transactions between our segments include distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for the sale of cable network programming and under retransmission consent agreements; content licensing revenue in Studios for licenses of owned content to Media and Sky; and advertising revenue in Media and Cable Communications. Revenue for licenses of content from Studios to Media and Sky is generally recognized at a point in time, consistent with the recognition of transactions with third parties, when the content is delivered and made available for use. The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period.

      "question": "How does Disney's strategic emphasis on increasing investment in the Experiences segment align with the financial exposure to elevated operating labor costs, especially given the sensitivity of this segment's profitability to labor expense fluctuations?",
      "answer": "Disney has explicitly stated its intention to increase investment in the Experiences segment amid broader economic pressures, including elevated labor costs that are expected to remain high (page_20). The Experiences segment, which includes theme parks, resorts, and cruise operations, incurs significant operating labor costs as a core component of its expenses (page_38). These labor costs are not only a major expense category but also a variable cost that can fluctuate with demand, wage inflation, and operational intensity. On page 12, labor is highlighted as a primary operating expense, directly tied to the delivery of guest experiences, which are central to the segment\u2019s revenue streams such as admissions, food and beverage, and resort stays. Given that the company is directing capital toward expanding parks and experiences, the alignment of this strategy with the financial sensitivity to labor costs raises a key risk: if labor costs rise faster than revenue growth or pricing power can offset, the return on investment in the Experiences segment could be materially impacted. This creates a tension between strategic growth and cost control that is central to Disney\u2019s 2024 business planning.",

While a number of different factors affect the demand for our products and services, actual or perceived economic conditions could contribute to lower attendance or spending at our parks and experiences businesses, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products and linear platforms, subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC platforms or licensing fees, while also continuing to increase the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Even if inflationary pressures moderate, we expect certain costs, such as for labor, to remain elevated. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and ex periences we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs, including borrowing costs as a result of elevated interest rates, making it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations and investments on favorable terms. A decline in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated could impact implementation or success of our business plans, such as our plans to increase investment in our Experiences segment, the realignment of our cost structure and plans for our DTC ad-supported services, enhancements, pricing structure and price increases. Unfavorable economic conditions also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. The adverse impact on our businesses of actual or perceived declines in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated will depend, in part, on their severity and duration and our ability to mitigate these impacts on our businesses is limited.\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses.\n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses, including by impacting the cost in U.S. dollars of providing our goods and services, our revenues in U.S. dollars generated by our international businesses and the international demand for our domestic products and services. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar adversely impacts the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and contributes to reduced international demand for our domestic products and services, including international travel to our domestic parks and resorts. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar often increases the cost of labor, goods and services in, or originating from, non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in certain countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries.\n\n## Changes in technology, in consumer consumption patterns and in how entertainment products are created affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products and the cost of producing or distributing these products.\n\nThe media entertainment and technology businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to new technologies including shifting patterns of content consumption and how entertainment products are generated. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. These developments have impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast and cable television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels. These developments have decreased advertising and affiliate revenue at some of our linear networks and have led, and may lead in the future, to the impairment of the value of certain of our assets. In addition, theater-going to watch movies has remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRules governing new technological developments, such as developments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI and large language model tools, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue streams for the use of our IP, how we create our entertainment products and the competition we face. In order to respond to the impact of new technologies on our businesses, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement new initiatives and changes to our business models, including by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, reorganizing our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies and developing new media offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, new media offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to technological changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution impacts the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. As part of our DTC strategy, we forgo certain revenue from certain traditional sources as we invest in our DTC offerings. Since launch, our DTC streaming services experienced significant losses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will each be or remain profitable or be as profitable over the long term as our historic business models.",

      "answer": "Disney Parks, Experiences and Products reported Domestic Revenue of $20,131 million in 2022, up from $9,353 million in 2021 \u2014 a growth of over 100%. Meanwhile, the amortization expense for the segment remained nearly flat at $109 million in 2022 compared to $108 million in 2021. This suggests that the segment achieved substantial revenue growth without a corresponding increase in amortization costs, potentially indicating efficient use of existing intangible assets or a strategic focus on leveraging established brands and properties rather than acquiring new ones. This low asset intensity could reflect a capital-light growth model in this segment.",

      "answer": "The 17.1% increase in Direct Network Costs from 2020 to 2021, as disclosed in the operating costs section, is attributed in part to the Sky segment. Despite this significant cost increase, the Sky segment contributed only $32 million in intersegment revenue in 2021, which is notably low compared to other segments like Studios ($3,186 million) or Media ($2,330 million). This contrast suggests that while Sky is contributing to rising costs\u2014particularly in network infrastructure\u2014it is not generating proportionate internal revenue, potentially signaling inefficiencies or a heavier reliance on external revenue streams. The Sky segment's cost-driven impact on the company's operations appears more pronounced than its internal revenue contribution, which may affect profitability and strategic resource allocation.",

      "answer": "Disney earns royalties on revenues from Tokyo Disney Resort, which includes two theme parks (Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea) and recently expanded with the addition of Fantasy Springs in June 2024. This contrasts with Disney\u2019s direct ownership and operation of theme parks at Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris, where it controls capital investments and expansion decisions, such as the upcoming Frozen-themed area at Disneyland Paris opening in 2026. While Disney does not own or operate Tokyo Disney Resort (managed by OLC), it still benefits from its intellectual property and brand through royalty payments tied to the resort's performance, including the new attractions. This hybrid model allows Disney to generate revenue from global theme park growth without full capital exposure.",

      "answer": "The $5.35 billion increase in Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities in 2023 includes significant outflows tied to restructuring activities, such as the $1.74 billion in restructuring charges recorded under the FoA segment. These charges were largely driven by the 2022 layoffs, which created severance and other personnel liabilities that are explicitly included within the Accrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities line item. This indicates that a meaningful portion of the increase in accrued liabilities was due to ongoing obligations from the restructuring efforts initiated in 2022 and continued into 2023.",

      "question": "Given that the Communications segment contributed all of the company's segment operating income in 2023, how does the 4.0% year-over-year growth in its operating income compare with the consolidated AT&T Operating Income, which declined from $25.9B in 2021 to $23.5B in 2023?",
      "answer": "The Communications segment's operating income grew by 4.0% from $26.7B in 2022 to $27.8B in 2023, and it accounted for the entirety of the company's segment operating income in both years. However, when considering the broader consolidated AT&T Operating Income, which includes reconciling items such as corporate expenses, restructuring charges, and asset impairments, the figure declined from $25.9B in 2021 to $23.5B in 2023.

      "question": "Given the decline in Business Wireline operating income and the overall increase in the Communications segment operating income margin from 22.8% in 2022 to 23.0% in 2024, how does the shift in revenue composition across business units contribute to this margin improvement despite the drop in total operating income?",
      "answer": "The Communications segment operating income margin increased slightly from 22.8% in 2022 to 23.0% in 2024, even though total operating income declined in 2024. This margin improvement was driven by a shift in revenue composition across business units. Specifically, the Business Wireline unit saw a significant drop in operating income from $2,290 million in 2022 to just $88 million in 2024, which contributed to downward pressure on overall operating income. However, this was offset by strong performance in the Mobility and Consumer Wireline units, which saw increases in operating income to $26,314 million and $869 million respectively in 2024. These units have higher operating income margins (30.9% and 6.4%) compared to Business Wireline (-0.5%), which helped lift the overall segment margin despite the drop in total revenues and operating income. This suggests that the Communications segment is becoming more reliant on high-margin Mobility services and less on declining legacy Business Wireline offerings.",

Revenue declines were also driven by lower Mobility equipment revenue. These decreases were partially offset by increases in Mobility service revenue and our Consumer Wireline business unit, driven by gains in wireless and broadband services.\n\nOperating income decreased in 2024 and increased in 2023. The 2024 operating income reflects a decrease in operating income from our Business Wireline business unit, partially offset by increases in our Mobility and Consumer Wireline business units.

      "answer": "Disney Parks, Experiences and Products reported Domestic Revenue of $20,131 million in 2022, a significant increase from $9,353 million in 2021 (>100% growth), as disclosed on page 50. Meanwhile, on page 52, the segment's amortization expense remained nearly flat at $109 million in 2022 compared to $108 million in 2021. This contrast suggests that despite strong revenue growth in the domestic market, Disney did not significantly increase its investment in intangible assets for this segment during the period, potentially indicating a focus on leveraging existing assets rather than new acquisitions or investments in the short term.",

      "answer": "AT&T's fair value assessment of the Consumer Wireline reporting unit, conducted using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches due to impairment indicators, must be evaluated in the context of its recent financial performance and contribution to the Communications Segment. According to the income statement details, Consumer Wireline generated $869 million in operating income in 2024, a 33.5% increase from $651 million in 2023. This growth contributed to the broader Communications Segment, which reported $27,095 million in operating income for 2024. The Consumer Wireline segment also demonstrated a 6.4% operating income margin and a 33.4% EBITDA margin in 2024, both improvements from the prior year. These positive financial trends appear to contrast with the need for a fair value impairment assessment, suggesting either a forward-looking concern not yet reflected in the 2024 results or a divergence between short-term performance and long-term cash flow expectations under the impairment models.",

      "question": "Given the Communications Segment's declining operating income margin from 23.0% in 2024 compared to 23.6% in 2023, and the Business Wireline segment's negative operating income of $88 million in 2024, how does the company's decision to estimate the implied fair value of the Business Wireline reporting unit using nonrecurring fair value measurements align with its broader segment performance trends?",
      "answer": "The Communications Segment's overall operating income margin declined slightly from 23.6% in 2023 to 23.0% in 2024, driven largely by the Business Wireline segment's poor performance, which reported a negative operating income of $88 million in 2024. This underperformance of Business Wireline, a key component of the Communications Segment, likely triggered the need for nonrecurring fair value measurements as part of impairment analysis. The company's decision to estimate the implied fair value of the Business Wireline reporting unit using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches indicates concerns about the long-term viability or value contribution of this segment, especially in light of its deteriorating financial performance. This aligns with the broader trend of segmental weakness in Business Wireline, which is contributing to downward pressure on the overall profitability of the Communications Segment.",

However, this growth is partially fueled by rising advertising and promotional expenses, which increased operating costs for Google Services.

The investments  that  we  are  making  across  Google  Services,  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that  are  useful  to  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content providers. Our investments in Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital  and,  in  pursuing  new  strategies,  we  may  incur  unanticipated  liabilities. These  endeavors  may  involve  significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  diversion  of  resources  and  management  attention  from  current  operations  and,  with respect  to  Other  Bets,  the  use  of  alternative  investment,  governance,  or  compensation  structures  that  may  fail  to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\n\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in  product  price  and  performance  characteristics,  and  price  and  feature  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\n\nWithin  Google  Cloud,  we  devote  significant  resources  to  develop  and  deploy  our  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.\n\nWithin  Other  Bets,  we  are  investing  significantly  in  the  areas  of  health,  life  sciences,  and  transportation,  among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\n\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\n\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition. Changes  in  device  mix,  geographic  mix,  ongoing  product  and  policy  changes,  product  mix,  and  property  mix  and  an increasing  competition  for  advertising  may  also  affect  our  advertising  revenue  growth  rate.  We  may  also  experience  a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other factors.\n\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such  as  the  continued  expansion  of  our  business  into  new  fields,  including  products  and  services  such  as  hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increased costs for many aspects of our business. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet.

      "answer": "The revenue from Theme Park Admissions is a core service revenue stream specifically called out in the revenue recognition section on page 84. This revenue stream directly contributes to the financial performance of the DPEP segment, which primarily generates revenue from theme park admissions and related offerings. However, despite this revenue generation, the carrying value of DPEP's intangible assets remained unchanged at $5,550 million in the consolidated balance sheet on page 83, suggesting that the segment's intangible asset valuation is not being adjusted in line with current operating performance. This could indicate either stable long-term asset value or conservative accounting treatment.",

When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2022 and 2021 were fifty-two week years. Fiscal 2020 was a fifty-three week year, which began on September 29, 2019 and ended on October 3, 2020.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2020 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2022 presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games\n\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of services include:\n\n- Programming and production costs\n- Distribution costs\n- Operating labor\n- Facilities and infrastructure costs\n\nSignificant tangible product revenues include:\n\n- The sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our retail locations\n- The sale of DVDs and Blu-ray discs\n- The sale of books, comic books and magazines\n\nSignificant operating costs related to the sale of tangible products include:\n\n- Costs of goods sold\n- Operating labor\n- Programming and production costs\n- Distribution costs\n- Retail occupancy costs\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company's revenue recognition policies are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees are recognized as the programming is provided based on contractually specified per subscriber rates and the actual number of the affiliate's customers receiving the programming. For affiliate contracts with fixed license fees, the fees are recognized ratably over the contract term. If an affiliate contract includes a minimum guaranteed license fee, the guaranteed license fee is recognized ratably over the guaranteed period and any fees earned in excess of the guarantee are recognized as earned once the minimum guarantee has been exceeded. Affiliate agreements may also include a license to use the network programming for on demand viewing. As the fees charged under these contracts are generally based on a contractually specified per subscriber rate for the number of underlying subscribers of the affiliate, revenues are recognized as earned.",

Total may not equal the sum of the column due to rounding. (2)\n\nIncludes amortization of intangibles related to TFCF equity investees. (3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

      "answer": "In 2024, the theme parks segment revenue decreased primarily due to lower domestic attendance, which directly affected guest spending, including in-park spending on food, beverages, and merchandise. Despite this decline, in-park spending remains a core revenue driver for the segment, as highlighted in the description of revenue sources from guest spending at the parks. At the same time, the company reported increased costs and expenses for the theme parks segment, driven by higher operational costs and significant preopening expenses for Epic Universe, which is set to open in May 2025. The continued emphasis on in-park spending indicates a strategic focus on maximizing per-guest revenue to offset rising costs and fund future expansion. This alignment suggests that the company is prioritizing revenue optimization from existing guests to support both current operations and long-term growth initiatives like Epic Universe.",

We also produce television content jointly as co-producers with third-party studios and production companies. Our television studios produce content primarily under the following names:\n\n- Universal Television\n- Universal Content Productions\n- Universal Television Alternative Studio\n- Universal International Studios\n- Sky Studios\n\nOur original content is primarily initially licensed to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, including those in our Media and Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segments. We also license content after its initial airing, license older television content from our television library, and distribute owned and acquired content globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products.  The production and distribution costs related to original broadcast television content generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial license, which means that obtaining additional licenses following the initial network license is critical to the content's financial success. Similar to our film studios, we typically owe residuals and participations payments in connection with television studio productions.\n\n## Theme Parks Segment\n\nOur Theme Parks segment primarily includes the operations of the following Universal theme parks:\n\n- Universal Orlando Resort : Includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, and our water park, V olcano Bay, all of which are located in Orlando, Florida. Universal Orlando Resort also includes Universal CityWalk Orlando, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and features onsite themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest, and will include an additional theme park, Epic Universe, that is expected to open in May 2025.\n- Universal Studios Hollywood : Includes the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park located in Hollywood, California and Universal CityWalk Hollywood, a dining, retail and entertainment complex.\n- Universal Studios Japan : Includes the Universal Studios Japan theme park located in Osaka, Japan.\n- Universal  Beijing  Resort :  Includes  the  Universal  Studios  Beijing  theme  park,  as  well  as  Universal  CityWalk  Beijing,  a  dining,  retail  and  entertainment complex, and on-site themed hotels, all of which are located in Beijing, China. Universal Beijing Resort is owned by us and a consortium of Chinese stateowned companies (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\nOur Theme Parks segment properties are primarily owned by us, although certain properties are leased, including land in Beijing, China and Osaka, Japan. We have invested and will continue to invest significantly in ex isting and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, as well as in new destinations and ex periences, such as Epic Universe; Universal Kids Resort, a smaller-scale theme park in Frisco, Texas expected to open in 2026; and Universal Horror Unleashed, a year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas, Nevada expected to open in 2025.\n\nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks, including ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise, and from our consumer products business. Revenue for our theme parks generally depends on the overall environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on leisure and other recreational activities.\n\nWe also license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. The themed elements in our rides, attractions, and merchandising are based on intellectual property in our Studios and Media segments and intellectual property licensed from third parties under long-term agreements.\n\n## Competition\n\n## Media\n\nOur  Media  segment  competes  for  viewers'  attention  and  audience  share  with  all  forms  of  programming  provided  to  viewers,  including  DTC  streaming  service providers; television networks; local broadcast television stations; physical and digital home entertainment products; video on demand and pay-per-view services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "The Studios segment experienced reduced content licensing revenue due to the WGA and SAG work stoppages from May to September 2023 and July to November 2023, respectively. This disruption paused productions and consequently reduced programming and production costs at both the Studios and Media segments. While the Studios segment's results of operations were not directly impacted by this shift, the broader Content & Experiences business was affected due to the internal licensing of content to the Media segment, including for Peacock. This dynamic highlights the interdependence between the two segments and the vulnerability of the Content & Experiences strategy to production delays.

      "answer": "AT&T highlights EBITDA margin as a critical measure of cash generation potential across business units (page 38). The Communications segment EBITDA margin increased from 38.3% in 2023 to 39.5% in 2024, a 1.2 percentage point rise (page 25). This growth occurred even as operating revenues declined due to lower Business Wireline and Mobility equipment revenues, suggesting improved cost management or pricing discipline within the segment. The alignment indicates that despite revenue pressures, the company is achieving better operational efficiency, which supports its strategic focus on EBITDA margin as a proxy for financial health and cash flow generation.",

However, in the risk factors section, the company acknowledges that increasing competition in the DTC streaming space could reduce prices for subscription services, including those offered by Disney. This creates a tension between the strategic importance of subscription fees as a revenue source and the external market pressures that may limit Disney's ability to raise or maintain those fees. The mention of competitors using targeted advertising technologies and offering alternative content platforms further underscores the potential erosion of pricing power, despite the company's investment in DTC as a growth lever.",

Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Increased competitive pressures impact our revenues, increase our costs and impact the profitability of our businesses.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

      "answer": "The Business Wireline segment generated $25,901 million in revenue but only $5,137 million in operating contribution, indicating that a significant portion of its revenue was consumed by operations and support expenses, which totaled $15,839 million. This suggests a high-cost structure, where expenses account for approximately 61% of the segment's revenue, leaving a smaller proportion for operating contribution.",

      "question": "Given Reality Labs accounts for 20% of Meta's total costs and is central to its metaverse strategy, how does the exclusion of asset and liability information from segment reporting impact the evaluation of Meta's long-term investment in immersive technologies?",
      "answer": "Meta allocates 20% of its total costs to Reality Labs, which is positioned as the key driver of the company's metaverse vision\u2014a long-term, ecosystem-focused initiative expected to evolve over the next decade. However, the financial reporting structure explicitly states that the chief operating decision maker evaluates segment performance based only on revenue and income (loss) from operations, without considering asset or liability information. This creates a gap in visibility for analysts assessing the sustainability and efficiency of Meta's long-term investment in immersive technologies, as there is no disclosed data on capital expenditures, asset utilization, or balance sheet exposure tied specifically to Reality Labs. The lack of asset and liability metrics limits the ability to evaluate how effectively Meta is deploying resources to develop the foundational technologies of the metaverse, despite the segment's strategic importance and significant operating cost allocation.",

      "answer": "The decline in episodic content sales, which contributed to the decrease in TV/VOD distribution revenue (page 43), directly affects the Content Sales/Licensing segment, as this segment generates revenue from the sale of episodic content in the TV/VOD market. Despite this decline, the Content Sales/Licensing segment saw a prior-year boost from the termination of a content license agreement with A+E, which generated a $56 million gain (page 37). This indicates that while the segment faces headwinds in traditional content sales, one-time strategic decisions or contractual terminations can provide temporary financial relief. Additionally, the segment also benefits from intersegment allocations from the Experiences segment, which helps offset some of the declines in direct content sales.",

      "question": "Given the increasing focus on Google Cloud as a growth driver, how does the $2.5 billion reduction in operating loss for Google Cloud relate to the rise in compensation expenses, particularly in light of the 11% headcount increase mentioned in R&D spending?",
      "answer": "Google Cloud's operating loss decreased by $2.5 billion from 2020 to 2021, primarily due to revenue growth, although this was partially offset by higher expenses, especially compensation costs. This aligns with the broader trend where R&D expenses increased by $4.0 billion, driven by a $3.5 billion rise in compensation expenses, largely attributed to an 11% increase in headcount. This suggests that Google's investment in talent, particularly in strategic areas like Google Cloud, is contributing to both rising costs and progress toward reducing the segment's operating loss, reflecting a deliberate trade-off between near-term expense growth and long-term strategic positioning.",

While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

      "answer": "Disney's total programming and production costs for 2024 amounted to $14.081 billion, a significant portion of which includes participations and residual expenses as explicitly stated in the Entertainment segment reporting. These participations and residual expenses are a core component of the segment's operating costs and directly impact its ability to manage content investment and operating margins. Since these costs are embedded within the broader programming and production framework\u2014alongside amortization, subscriber-based fees, and live programming costs\u2014they represent a structural expense that must be carefully balanced against revenue generation from subscription fees, advertising, and content licensing. The segment's financial planning must account for these fixed and variable cost elements when evaluating content investment decisions and margin optimization strategies.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

Programming and production costs include the following:\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs\n- Amortization of the costs of licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n- Selling, general and administrative costs, including marketing costs\n- Depreciation and amortization\n\n## Linear Networks\n\nThe majority of Linear Networks revenue is derived from affiliate fees and advertising. The Company's Linear Networks businesses provide programming under multi-year licensing agreements with MVPDs and/or affiliated television stations that are generally based on contractually specified rates on a per subscriber basis. The amounts that we can charge for our networks are largely dependent on the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide and the competitive market for programming services. The ability to sell advertising time and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand.\n\n## Domestic Linear Networks\n\n## ABC Network\n\nABC Network programming is aired in the primetime, daytime, late night, news and sports 'dayparts'. Primetime programming includes scripted series, reality programming and a variety of movies and specials. ESPN programs the sports daypart on ABC Network, which is branded ESPN on ABC. ABC Network distributes programming to approximately 245 local affiliated television stations and to our eight owned television stations, which collectively reach almost 100% of U.S. television households.\n\nABC Network produces a variety of unscripted series, primetime specials, news and daytime programming.\n\n## Disney Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: Disney Channel; Disney Junior; and Disney XD (collectively Disney Channels). Disney Channels air programming 24 hours a day targeted to kids ages 2 to 14 and generally feature live-action comedy series, animated programming and preschool series as well as original movies and theatrical films.\n\n## Freeform\n\nFreeform is a channel targeted to viewers ages 18 to 34 that airs original and licensed television series, films and holiday programming events.\n\n## FX Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: FX; FXM; and FXX (collectively FX Channels), which air a mix of original and licensed television series and films.\n\n## National Geographic Channels\n\nBranded television channels include: National Geographic; Nat Geo Wild; and Nat Geo Mundo (collectively National Geographic Channels). National Geographic Channels air programming in genres such as travel, adventure, wildlife, documentary, science and history.",

While other segments like Mobility ($23,812 million operating income) and Business Wireline ($2,290 million) generated positive returns, the magnitude of the Corporate and Other losses overwhelmed these gains, leading to the overall decline in consolidated operating income. This is further evidenced by the fact that the consolidated operating income dropped from $1,289 million in the prior year to a loss of $88 million in 2024, showing how the corporate-level losses disproportionately impacted overall profitability.",

      "answer": "The Consumer Wireline segment's operating contribution declined significantly from $2,357 million in 2020 to $977 million in 2021, a decrease of 58.6%. This deterioration in profitability aligns with the broader Communications Segment's asset valuation decline, as its total assets dropped from $91,976 million at the beginning of 2020 to $91,900 million by the end of 2021. Despite no acquisitions or major disposals in the Communications Segment, the consistent impairments and operating losses\u2014particularly in Consumer Wireline\u2014contributed to the erosion of asset value, suggesting a direct financial linkage between the segment's declining performance and its shrinking asset base.",

      "question": "How does Disney's entitlement to management fees from Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort relate to its stake in the management companies that operate these parks, and what does this imply about Disney's strategic control and financial exposure in Asia?",
      "answer": "Disney is entitled to receive management fees from both Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort based on their operating performance. In the case of Shanghai Disney Resort, Disney holds a 70% interest in the management company responsible for operating the resort, which generates management fees. This structure allows Disney to exert strategic control over the parks\u2019 operations while maintaining a minority equity stake in the parks themselves (48% in Hong Kong and 43% in Shanghai). By consolidating the Asia Theme Parks due to the management companies\u2019 significant influence and receipt of management fees, Disney reflects these operations in its financial statements, indicating a high level of financial exposure despite not owning a majority of the parks\u2019 equity. This dual-layer structure enables Disney to maintain brand consistency and operational influence while managing capital investment risk.",

        "Hop 3: [Management Companies] \u2190 [DIS](page_84): Disney consolidates the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements due to its control through the management companies, even though it holds less than 50% equity in the parks themselves."

      "answer": "The Business Wireline segment generated $25,901 million in revenue, accounting for 23.5% of the total Communications segment revenue of $109,969 million in 2022. However, its Operating Contribution of $5,137 million represented only 17.2% of the total Communications segment Operating Contribution of $29,815 million.

      "answer": "The decrease in Corporate and Other expenses in 2021 was primarily due to lower severance charges compared to the prior year, as noted in the Segment Operating Results section. However, this reduction was more than offset by significant increases in expenses across other segments\u2014particularly NBCUniversal and Cable Communications\u2014which collectively contributed to a 59.0% year-over-year rise in total Operating Costs and Expenses. The consolidated financial table confirms this increase despite cost savings in corporate activities, highlighting the dominant impact of segment-level cost growth on the overall expense trajectory.",

      "question": "How does the prepaid (accrued) pension cost for Disney's postretirement medical plans relate to the underfunded status of those plans, and what does this imply about the company's short-term versus long-term obligations under these plans?",
      "answer": "Disney's prepaid (accrued) pension cost for postretirement medical plans is reported as $883 million on page 102, indicating a prepaid amount. However, on page 101, the underfunded status of the postretirement medical plans is reported as $790 million as of October 1, 2022. This suggests that while the company has a prepaid position in the pension plans overall, the postretirement medical plans specifically remain underfunded. The difference highlights a nuanced financial exposure: although Disney has prepaid amounts related to these plans, the long-term obligations still exceed the fair value of plan assets, creating a liability that may require future contributions or impact liquidity.",

      "answer": "Verizon reorganized its Business segment in Q1 2023, creating the Business Markets and Other group by combining customers previously in the Small and Medium Business group (excluding commercial wireline customers), BlueJeans customers from Global Enterprise and Public Sector and Other, and Connect customers from Public Sector and Other. This reorganization reflects a strategic shift to better align customer segments with service offerings. Concurrently, Verizon invested $18.8 billion in capital expenditures during 2023, focusing on 5G network development, C-Band spectrum deployment (now covering 242 million people), and fiber-based networks to support growing demand for high-speed connections and advanced business services. The alignment suggests that the reorganization supports a more targeted delivery of next-generation network capabilities to specific business customer groups.",

      "question": "Given DPEP's $5,550 million segment balance as of fiscal 2022 and its significant operational disruptions from the pandemic, how does Disney's human capital investment in theme parks and resorts reflect the scale and recovery needs of this business segment?",
      "answer": "Disney's DPEP segment, which includes theme parks and resorts, maintained a balance of $5,550 million as of fiscal 2022, despite widespread closures and operational restrictions caused by the pandemic. The filing notes that DPEP was 'most significantly' impacted by the pandemic, with theme parks, cruises, and guided tours suspended for extended periods. As operations resumed, Disney incurred 'additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests, and talent.' These recovery efforts align with the company's human capital disclosures, which highlight that a 'significant number of employees' are based in the theme parks and that Disney has implemented specific DE&I programs, updated appearance guidelines, and workforce mobility initiatives to support a high-performing and inclusive workforce in this labor-intensive segment. This reflects a strategic alignment between DPEP's financial position and the company's operational and cultural investments in its theme parks and resorts.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## PART I\n\n## ITEM 1. Business\n\nThe Walt Disney Company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified worldwide entertainment company with operations in two segments: Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution (DMED) and Disney Parks, Experiences and Products (DPEP).\n\nThe terms 'Company', 'we', 'our' and 'us' are used in this report to refer collectively to the parent company and the subsidiaries through which businesses are conducted.\n\n## COVID-19 Pandemic\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or cancelled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme park and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout fiscal 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruption of content production activities.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 related disruptions on our financial and operating results will be dictated by the currently unknowable duration and severity of COVID-19 and its variants, and among other things, governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward. We have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to address government regulations and the safety of our employees, guests and talent.\n\n## Human Capital\n\nThe Company's key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, the Company's human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and perquisite programs; enhance the Company's culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company's content, products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.\n\nThe Company employed approximately 220,000 people as of October 1, 2022, of which approximately 166,000 were employed in the U.S. and approximately 54,000 were employed internationally. Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 78% full time and 15% part time employees, with another 7% being seasonal employees. A significant number of employees in various parts of our businesses, including employees of our theme parks, and writers, directors, actors and production personnel for our productions are covered by collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our employees outside the U.S. are represented by works councils, trade unions or other employee associations.\n\nSome of our key programs and initiatives to attract, develop and retain our diverse workforce include:\n\n- Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&amp;I): Our DE&amp;I objectives are to build teams that reflect the life experiences of our audiences, while employing and supporting a diverse array of voices in our creative and production teams. Our DE&amp;I initiatives and programs include:\n- The Company's Reimagine Tomorrow efforts, which build on Disney's longstanding commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion, and features a website, Disney's first large-scale platform for amplifying underrepresented voices\n- Executive Incubator, Creative Talent Development and Inclusion, and the Disney Launchpad: Shorts Incubator, which are designed to create a pipeline of next-generation creative executives from underrepresented backgrounds\n- Development programs, which target underrepresented talent\n- Innovative learning opportunities, which spark dialogue among employees, leaders, Disney talent and external experts\n- Over 100 employee-led Business Employee Resource Groups (BERGs), which represent and support the diverse communities that make up our workforce\n- The Disney Look appearance guidelines, which were updated to cultivate a more inclusive environment that encourages and celebrates authentic expressions of belonging among employees",

      "answer": "Despite the pandemic's significant negative impact on NBCUniversal's operations\u2014particularly its theme parks, which faced capacity restrictions and temporary closures\u2014the segment still reported $5.355 billion in Adjusted EBITDA for 2021. This suggests resilience in other parts of the business, such as the Media and Studios segments, which together contributed $6.615 billion in Adjusted EBITDA, offsetting losses in Theme Parks. Furthermore, NBCUniversal's relatively low debt balance of $1.6 billion as of December 31, 2021, indicates a conservative capital structure for the segment, which may have provided financial flexibility to manage through the pandemic-related disruptions while maintaining positive overall Adjusted EBITDA.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "In 2020, NBCUniversal incurred significant severance charges as part of cost savings initiatives tied to the realignment of its television businesses, which were reported in the Corporate and Other segment. By the end of 2021, payments related to these severance charges were substantially complete, and the majority of the associated cost savings were being realized in operating costs and expenses. This reduction in expenses aligns with the observed decline in NBCUniversal's debt from $2.8 billion in 2020 to $1.6 billion by 2021, as lower operating costs likely contributed to improved financial flexibility and debt reduction. The cost savings were partially offset by new investments such as Sky Glass and XClass TV, but the overall efficiency gains from severance-related restructuring supported NBCUniversal\u2019s deleveraging efforts.",

Other business initiatives include costs associated with the launch of Sky Glass and the related hardware sales, as well as costs associated with the launch of XClass TV.\n\nRevenue increased in 2021 primarily due to increases at Comcast Spectacor as a result of the impacts of COVID-19 in the prior year period and sales of Sky Glass televisions.\n\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year periods in response to COVID-19, including severance charges  related  to  our  businesses,  partially  offset  by  costs  related  to  Sky  Glass  and  XClass  TV .  In  2020,  our  businesses implemented separate cost savings initiatives, with the most significant relating to severance at NBCUniversal in connection with the realignment of the operating structure in our television businesses as well as overall reductions in the cost base. The costs of these initiatives were presented in Corporate and Other. Payments related to NBCUniversal employee severance were substantially complete in 2021 and the substantial majority of the related costs savings were being realized in operating costs and expenses as of the end of 2021. A portion of these cost savings may be reallocated to investments in content and other strategic initiatives. We expect to incur increased costs in 2022 related to the launch of Sky Glass and XClass TV.",

In contrast, Residential Connectivity & Platforms incurs costs for these rights, which are recognized over the license period as the content is used. This difference in timing of revenue and cost recognition results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (or losses) on these intersegment transactions are deferred in consolidated results and recognized over the license period. This timing mismatch directly influences the Adjusted EBITDA metric by delaying the recognition of the full economic impact of these transactions until the content is utilized.",

      "answer": "The theme parks segment revenue declined in 2024 due to lower attendance at domestic parks and negative foreign currency impacts internationally. Despite this, the segment remains focused on guest spending\u2014encompassing ticket sales, in-park purchases, and consumer products\u2014as its core revenue source. This strategic emphasis is reinforced by the upcoming opening of Epic Universe in May 2025, which is expected to drive future guest attendance and spending. The contradiction between current performance and future outlook suggests that management anticipates the new attraction will significantly boost guest traffic and spending, thereby reversing the current trend and supporting long-term growth.",

      "answer": "Disney+ Core subscribers grew by 9%, reaching 122.7 million as of September 28, 2024, indicating strong expansion in its streaming segment. Meanwhile, Disney's international linear family channels, which include Disney Channel and Disney Junior, had approximately 200 million unique subscribers as of September 2024, based on internal management reports. The 9% growth in Disney+ Core subscribers contrasts with the already substantial reach of Disney's traditional family channels, suggesting that while streaming platforms are experiencing meaningful growth, traditional linear networks still maintain broader global reach. This reflects a dual trajectory where streaming services are scaling rapidly but have not yet surpassed the established footprint of traditional TV in certain international markets.",

However, this growth was partially offset by increases in content acquisition costs and TAC. Content acquisition costs are explicitly identified as a direct cost within the Google Services segment, which also includes advertising and promotional activities and third-party services fees. Despite the revenue growth of over $32 billion year-over-year, the segment's operating income growth was constrained by rising content acquisition costs, indicating that a portion of the additional revenue was absorbed by these increasing direct expenses.",

      "question": "How does Disney's $95 million contribution to postretirement medical plans in fiscal 2024 reconcile with the $467 million prior service cost deficit listed for those same plans, and what does this imply about the company's long-term funding obligations?",
      "answer": "Disney contributed $95 million to its postretirement medical plans in fiscal 2024, yet the prior service cost deficit for these plans stands at $467 million, indicating that the recent contribution only partially addresses accumulated unfunded obligations. This discrepancy suggests that the company faces significant long-term liabilities related to these plans that are not fully mitigated by current-year contributions. The presence of a large prior service cost deficit despite recent funding highlights the ongoing financial burden and potential future cash outflows Disney may face in meeting its postretirement medical obligations.",

        "Hop 1: [DIS](page_107) \u2192 [Postretirement Medical Plans]: Disney contributed $95 million to its postretirement medical plans in fiscal 2024 and holds investments in company stock and alternative assets to support these obligations.",
        "Hop 2: [Postretirement Medical Plans] \u2192 [Prior Service Costs]: The postretirement medical plans are impacted by prior service costs, which represent unfunded obligations from plan amendments or changes in benefits.",

      "question": "Given that the Family of Apps segment accounted for 80% of total costs and expenses in 2023, how does the allocation methodology for indirect operating expenses, such as data center costs, impact the profitability of the Family of Apps compared to Reality Labs?",
      "answer": "The Family of Apps (FoA) segment accounted for $70.13 billion of the company's total costs and expenses in 2023, representing 80% of the total investment. These costs include direct expenses related to product development, data centers, and technical infrastructure. Meanwhile, indirect operating expenses\u2014such as data center operations, facilities, and IT\u2014are allocated to segments based on usage. Since FoA is the dominant segment in terms of scale and infrastructure demand, it likely absorbs a disproportionately large share of these indirect costs. This allocation methodology may suppress the apparent profitability of the FoA segment relative to Reality Labs (RL), which accounted for only 20% of total costs ($18.02 billion) and may benefit from lower infrastructure intensity. The CODM evaluates performance based on segment-level revenue and operating income, meaning that the cost allocation framework significantly shapes internal performance assessments and strategic investment decisions.",

      "answer": "The decrease in guest spending at domestic theme parks, primarily driven by lower attendance, has resulted in reduced Theme Parks segment revenue. Despite this revenue decline, the segment's costs and expenses have increased in 2024 due to higher operational costs and significant preopening costs related to the upcoming Epic Universe park, which is expected to open in May 2025. This dynamic highlights a short-term pressure on profitability as the company invests heavily in new attractions while facing current market headwinds in visitor numbers.",

Guest spending includes ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise. We also generate revenue from our consumer products business. Additionally, we license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. We recognize revenue from ticket sales when the tickets are used, generally within a year from the date of purchase. For annual passes, we generally recognize revenue on a straight-line basis over the period the pass is available to be used. We recognize revenue from in-park spending and consumer products at the point of sale.\n\n## Consolidated Balance Sheets\n\nThe  table  below  summarizes  our  accounts  receivable,  other  balances  that  are  not  separately  presented  in  our  consolidated  balance  sheets  that  relate  to  the recognition of revenue and collection of the related cash, and deferred costs associated with our contracts with customers.\n\n",

      "answer": "Disney's Postretirement Medical Plans' projected benefit obligation decreased from $2,121 million in fiscal 2021 to $1,539 million in fiscal 2022, driven by an actuarial gain of $595 million. This actuarial gain also contributed to the total amounts included in AOCI, which showed a net actuarial loss of $3,745 million across both pension and postretirement plans, with the postretirement portion reflecting a $93 million loss. The actuarial gain on the postretirement plans helped reduce the overall liability, yet the AOCI table indicates that net losses still dominate, suggesting continued long-term funding pressure on Disney's benefit plans.",

      "answer": "The Media segment reported an 18% decline in Adjusted EBITDA to $4.6 billion, partly due to the absence of $1.8 billion in revenue from the Tokyo Olympics, which occurred in 2021. This decline was exacerbated by broader pandemic-related disruptions outlined in the risk factors section, such as reduced sports programming availability and ongoing operational constraints. Specifically, Sky's direct-to-consumer revenue was negatively impacted by the closures of commercial customers' locations and delayed sports seasons, which shifted event costs and revenue recognition into later periods. These combined pressures from both the Media segment and Sky operations contributed to continued uncertainty and adverse effects on CMCSA's consolidated financial performance, particularly as the pandemic's impact persisted into 2022.",

Our  Annual  Reports  on  Form  10-K,  Quarterly  Reports  on  Form  10-Q,  Current  Reports  on  Form  8-K  and  any amendments to such reports filed with or furnished to the SEC under Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'), are available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on our website at www.comcastcorporation.com  as  soon  as  reasonably  practicable  after  such  reports  are  electronically  filed  with  the  SEC.  The information posted on our websites is not incorporated into our SEC filings.\n\n## Caution Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\n\nThe SEC encourages companies to disclose forward-looking information so that investors can better understand a company's future prospects and make informed investment decisions. In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we state our beliefs of future events and of our future financial performance. In some cases, you can identify these so-called 'forward-looking statements' by words such as 'may,' 'will,' 'should,' 'expects,' 'believes,' 'estimates,' 'potential,' or 'continue,' or the negative of these words, and other comparable words. You should be aware that these statements are only our predictions. In evaluating these statements, you should consider various factors, including the risks and uncertainties listed in 'Risk Factors' and in other reports we file with the SEC.\n\nAdditionally, we operate in a highly competitive, consumer-driven and rapidly changing environment. This environment is affected by government regulation; economic, strategic, political and social conditions; consumer response to new and existing products and services; technological developments; and, particularly in view of new technologies, the ability to develop and protect intellectual property rights. Our actual results could differ materially from our forward-looking statements as a result of any of such factors, which could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations or financial condition. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.\n\n## Item 1A: Risk Factors\n\n## Risks Related to Our Business, Industry and Operations\n\n## The COVID-19 pandemic has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our businesses and results of operations.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways. In  particular,  COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations. For example, as a result of COVID-19, we have at times temporarily closed our theme parks or operated them with capacity restrictions. The creation and  availability  of  our  film  and  television  programming  globally  also  have  been  disrupted  as  a  result  of  COVID-19,  such  as postponements or cancellations of sporting events, theatrical closures and suspensions of entertainment content production.\n\nThe impact of COVID-19 on our businesses also generally depends on the extent of restrictive governmental measures taken that affect  day-to-day  life,  travel  protocols  and  the  length  of  time  that  such  measures  remain  in  place,  global  economic  conditions, current and new variants and vaccination rates and efficacy. It is difficult to predict the extent and duration and the degree to which our results of operations will continue to be affected.\n\nCOVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks set forth below.\n\n## Our businesses operate in highly competitive and dynamic industries, and our businesses and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not compete effectively.\n\nAll  of  our  businesses  operate  in  intensely  competitive,  consumer-driven,  rapidly  changing  environments  and  compete  with  a growing number of companies that provide a broad range of communications products and services as well as entertainment, sports, news and information content to consumers. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against our competitors or that competition will not have an adverse effect on our businesses.",

Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, revenue in the Media segment increased 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n- Media segment results include the operations of Peacock, which in 2021 generated revenue of $778 million and operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion, compared to revenue of $118 million and operating costs and expenses of $781 million in 2020.

Studios revenue included licenses of content to our Media and other segments, including the impact of a new licensing agreement  for  content  that  became  exclusively  available  for  streaming  on  Peacock  in  2021,  and  the  impacts  of  initial content licenses associated with the launch of Peacock in 2020, which are eliminated in consolidation.\n- Theme Parks segment revenue increased 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the operation of our theme parks in the current year period compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period and the opening of our theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\n- Revenue increased 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue increased 3.1% due to increases  in  advertising  and  direct-to-consumer  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  content  revenue,  which  were affected by COVID-19 in the prior year period and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period.\n- Adjusted  EBITDA increased  20.8%  to  $2.4  billion.

COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively.

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "The Consumer segment's $102.9 billion in operating revenues for 2024, as disclosed in the segment overview, aligns closely with the $103.5 billion in total consumer external operating revenues from the detailed revenue table. The $600 million difference may reflect intersegment revenue adjustments, as the table notes $203 million in intersegment revenues for the Consumer segment. These intersegment revenues are likely allocated costs for shared services or network infrastructure, as mentioned in the first section, which discusses centrally managed network and shared service costs being allocated to the Consumer and Business segments based on usage. This suggests that while the external revenue figure is slightly higher, the segment's reported operating revenues incorporate adjustments for internal cost allocations.",

      "answer": "The Business Wireline unit's operating income dropped significantly from $2,290 million in 2022 to a loss of $88 million in 2024, contrasting sharply with the steady growth in the Mobility unit (from $23,812 million to $26,314 million) and the modest increase in Consumer Wireline (from $634 million to $869 million). This shift indicates a growing reliance on Mobility for the Communications segment\u2019s overall profitability, which accounted for approximately 97% of total segment operating income in 2024. Given that Business Wireline was previously a substantial contributor to the segment\u2019s income, its decline raises concerns about the segment\u2019s long-term profitability composition and may signal a strategic reallocation of resources toward Mobility and Consumer Wireline at the expense of Business Wireline.",

      "question": "Given the increase in Google Services revenue from $272.5 billion in 2023 to $304.9 billion in 2024, how does the fluctuation in employee compensation expenses, which may not directly correlate with headcount due to vesting schedules of stock-based compensation, impact the cost structure and profitability of the Google Services segment?",
      "answer": "The Google Services segment revenue increased from $272.5 billion in 2023 to $304.9 billion in 2024, indicating strong growth. However, employee compensation expenses, which are a key component of the segment's cost structure, may not directly correlate with this revenue growth due to the timing of stock-based compensation (SBC) vesting schedules. This means that even with stable or increasing headcount, compensation costs could fluctuate independently, potentially affecting profitability. Additionally, the Google Services segment includes content and traffic acquisition costs, which are variable and tied to revenue, further complicating the relationship between revenue growth and cost management.",

        "Hop 1: GOOGL(page_34) \u2192 Employee Compensation Expenses: The document notes that employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount due to annual SBC awards that vest over four years.",

T hese serv ices  prov ide  access  to  solutions  such  as AI  offerings  including  our AI  infrastructure,  Vertex AI  platform,  and  Gemini  for  Google  Cloud; cybersecurity; and data and analytics;\n- Google  Workspace, which includes subscriptions  for  cloud-based  communication  and  collaboration  tools  for  enterprises,  such  as  Calendar, Gmail, Docs, Driv e, and Meet, with integrated features like Gemini for Google Workspace; and\n- other enterprise serv ices.\n\nFluctuations in our  Google  Cloud rev enues hav e been, and may continue to be, affected by factors in addition to the general factors described above, such as changes in customer usage and demand.\n\n## Other Bets\n\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of healthcare-related serv ices, and internet serv ices.\n\n## Costs and Expenses\n\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of rev enues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses include costs related to R&amp;D, sales and  marketing,  and  general  and  administrativ e  functions.  Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

      "answer": "The 2022 restructuring included layoffs of approximately 11,000 employees across the Family of Apps and Reality Labs segments, as well as facility consolidations, which contributed to a 7% increase in cost efficiency for the Family of Apps segment by 2024. This is evident from the segment's operating margin rising from 47% in 2023 to 54% in 2024, despite a 22% revenue growth, indicating that cost controls outpaced the growth in expenses. The restructuring appears to have enhanced operational efficiency, as reflected in the margin expansion, suggesting that the workforce reduction and facility consolidation meaningfully reduced operating costs relative to revenue growth.",

This segment experienced significant asset impairments and dispositions, including a $8,253 million impairment in 2020 and a $76 million disposition-related adjustment in 2021. The decline in overall revenues, combined with these asset actions, suggests that the Communications Segment\u2014despite its dominant revenue contribution\u2014faced structural or strategic challenges that required asset realignment during this period.",

      "answer": "Google Cloud's revenue increased from $33,088 million in 2023 to $43,229 million in 2024, representing a $10.1 billion growth. According to the operating income analysis, this growth was partially offset by increases in employee compensation expenses driven by headcount growth. In contrast, Google Services' operating income was positively impacted by a reduction in employee compensation expenses. This divergence suggests that Google is strategically allocating resources toward Google Cloud, increasing investment in human capital for that segment while managing costs in Google Services, likely to support the rapid expansion and operational demands of the Cloud division.",

      "answer": "The $899 million reduction in content amortization in 2024 due to tax incentives directly affects the cost basis of Netflix's content assets, which in turn influences the amortization calculations based on forecasted viewing patterns. Since content amortization is sensitive to assumptions about future viewing, a lower cost basis from tax incentives reduces the financial impact of any changes in those viewing estimates. This implies that the sensitivity analyses performed during the audit \u2014 which evaluated how changes in viewing assumptions affect amortization \u2014 would show a dampened volatility in amortization expense due to the reduced base amount. Therefore, the tax incentives not only lower reported amortization but also moderate the financial impact of forecast inaccuracies in viewing behavior.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

      "answer": "The 2024 10-K filing shows that amortization of capitalized production costs is a key component of the Entertainment segment's programming and production costs, which also include subscriber-based fees and production costs for live programming. Despite a 3% decrease in Disney+ and other content costs from $5,694 million in 2023 to $5,499 million in 2024, total programming and production costs slightly increased from $13,959 million to $14,081 million. This suggests that while Disney+ spending decreased, increased investment in other areas of content production, such as Hulu ($8,582 million in 2024 vs. $8,265 million in 2023), may have offset the decline. The amortization methodology, based on the estimated relative value of distribution windows, indicates that legacy content amortization continues to impact expenses even as strategic investments shift toward streaming platforms.",

      "answer": "AT&T reported an overall Operating Loss of $88 million in 2024 (from page 27), yet its Mobility segment alone generated a significant Operating Income of $23,812 million (from page 56). This contrast indicates that other business segments, such as Business Wireline, Consumer Wireline, and particularly Corporate and Other (which includes DTV-related retained costs and parent administration support), must have underperformed or incurred losses that offset the strong performance of the Mobility segment. Specifically, the Corporate and Other segment reported an Operating Loss of $30,997 million, which includes a $28,107 million loss from Certain Significant Items, suggesting that these non-Mobility areas are driving the consolidated operating loss.",

      "answer": "NFLX reported that tax incentives earned on qualified production spend reduced the cost-basis of content assets, resulting in lower content amortization over the life of the titles. Specifically, tax incentives led to reduced amortization expenses of $899 million in 2024, $835 million in 2023, and $719 million in 2022. These reductions in amortization expenses directly contributed to improved operating income, which rose from $5.6 billion in 2022 to $6.95 billion in 2023 and further to $10.42 billion in 2024. This shows that the tax incentives had a material positive effect on NFLX's profitability by lowering amortization costs and enhancing operating margins over time.",

This aligns with the $7.3 billion in amortization of owned content expenses recognized during the year, as programming costs are a major component of the segment's operating expenses. Meanwhile, the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021, shows that the company held $16,192 million in Cable Communications assets, which includes capitalized investments in programming content acquired through long-term licensing agreements.

For more information about our company's operations and the risks facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2021, and all amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Refer to Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, with the exception of the discussion and analysis related to our NBCUniversal segments, which is included below for all periods based on the updated segment structure.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications;  (2)  NBCUniversal  in  three  reportable  business  segments:  Media,  Studios  and  Theme  Parks  (collectively,  the 'NBCUniversal segments'); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment.\n\n## 2021 Developments\n\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:\n\n## Cable Communications\n\n- Revenue increased 7.1% to $64.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2% to $28.1 billion primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and technical and product support expenses.\n- Operating margin increased from 42.1% to 43.7%.",

      "answer": "Verizon's Consumer segment reported $102.9 billion in operating revenues for 2024, as disclosed in the narrative section describing the segment's performance. This aligns closely with the detailed financial table showing $103.5 billion in total consumer-related operating revenues, which includes $73.1 billion from service, $23.2 billion from wireless equipment, and $7.0 billion from other categories. The slight difference of approximately $0.6 billion can be attributed to eliminations or rounding adjustments, as noted in the footnotes and intersegment revenue disclosures, which account for internal transfers and adjustments not allocated to segment performance.",

Our wireless services are provided across one of the most extensive wireless networks in the U.S. under the V erizon family of brands and through wholesale and other arrangements. We also provide FWA broadband through our 5G or 4G LTE networks as an alternative to traditional landline internet access. Our wireline services are provided in nine states in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern U.S., as well as Washington D.C., over our 100% fiber-optic network through our V erizon Fios product portfolio and over a traditional copper-based network to customers who are not served by Fios.\n\nCustomers can obtain our wireless services on a postpaid or prepaid basis. Our postpaid service is generally billed one month in advance for a monthly access charge in return for access to and usage of network services. Our prepaid service is offered only to Consumer customers and enables individuals to obtain wireless services without credit verification by paying for all services in advance. The Consumer segment also offers several categories of wireless equipment to customers, including a variety of smartphones and other handsets, wireless-enabled internet devices, such as tablets, and other wireless-enabled connected devices, such as smart watches.\n\nIn addition to wireless services and equipment for retail customers, the Consumer segment sells residential fixed connectivity solutions, including internet, video and voice services, and wireless network access to resellers on a wholesale basis.\n\nThe Consumer segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $102.9 billion, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 1.3%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Consumer segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Verizon Business G roup\n\nOur  Business  segment  provides  wireless  and  wireline  communications  services  and  products,  including  FWA   broadband,  data,  video  and  advanced communication services, corporate networking solutions, security and managed network services, local and long distance voice services and network access to deliver various IoT services and products. We provide these products and services to businesses, public sector customers and wireless and wireline carriers across the U.S. and a subset of these products and services to customers around the world.\n\nThe Business segment's operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2024 totaled $29.5 billion, a decrease of $591 million, or 2.0%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2023. See \"Segment Results of Operations\" for additional information regarding our Business segment's operating performance and selected operating statistics.\n\n## Corporate and Other\n\nCorporate and other primarily includes device insurance programs, investments in unconsolidated businesses and development stage businesses that support our  strategic  initiativ es,  as  well  as  unallocated  corporate  ex penses,  certain  pension  and  other  employee  benefit  related  costs  and  interest  and  financing expenses. Corporate and other also includes the historical results of divested businesses and other adjustments and gains and losses that are not allocated or used in assessing segment performance due to their nature. A lthough such transactions are excluded from the business segment results, they are included in reported consolidated earnings. Gains and losses from these transactions that are not individually significant are included in segment results and therefore are included in the chief operating decision maker's assessment of segment performance.

      "question": "Given the Sports segment's reliance on affiliate fees as a primary revenue source, how does Disney's expectation of declining linear network subscribers impact the financial outlook for the Sports segment, especially in light of the planned Star India joint venture that will no longer be consolidated into Disney's financial statements?",
      "answer": "The Sports segment primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees, which are directly impacted by the number of linear network subscribers. Disney acknowledges in its trends section that declines in linear network subscribers and average viewership are expected to continue, which would negatively impact affiliate fees. This decline is particularly concerning given that the Sports segment's operating model is heavily dependent on these fees. However, Disney is making strategic investments in DTC offerings, which it hopes will offset these losses through growth in subscription and advertising revenues. Additionally, the upcoming Star India joint venture, in which Disney will hold only a 37% stake and will no longer consolidate into its financials, signals a strategic shift in how Disney monetizes its sports assets.

There were no dividends paid or share repurchases in fiscal 2023. The Company is targeting a total of $3 billion in share repurchases in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe Company may be required to pay an incremental amount for Hulu depending on a final determination of Hulu's fair value. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the transactions with noncontrolling interest holders.\n\nThe Company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be impacted by factors outside of its control. We believe that the Company's financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity under current bank facilities, taken together, provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements, contractual obligations, upcoming debt maturities as well as future capital ex penditures related to the ex pansion of ex isting businesses and development of new projects. In addition, the Company could undertake other measures to ensure sufficient liquidity, such as raising additional financing, reducing or not declaring future dividends; reducing or stopping share repurchases; reducing capital spending; reducing film and episodic content investments; or implementing further cost-saving initiatives.\n\nThe Company's borrowing costs can also be impacted by short- and long-term debt ratings assigned by nationally recognized rating agencies, which are based, in significant part, on the Company's performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as leverage and interest coverage ratios. As of September 28, 2024, Moody's Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A2 and P-1 (Stable), respectively, S&amp;P Global Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and A-2 (Positive), respectively, and Fitch Ratings' long- and short-term debt ratings for the Company were A- and F2 (Stable), respectively. The Company's bank facilities contain only one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage of three times earnings before interest, tax es, depreciation and amortization, including both intangible amortization and amortization of our film and television production and programming costs. On September 28, 2024, the Company met this covenant by a significant margin. The Company's bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, including the Asia Theme Parks, from any representations, covenants or events of default.\n\n## DEVELOPMENTS AND TRENDS\n\n## Star India Transaction\n\nThe Company and RIL plan to close a transaction on or about November 14, 2024, which will form a joint venture that combines our Star-branded and other general entertainment and sports television channels and Disney+ Hotstar service in India (Star India) and certain media and entertainment businesses of RIL (see Note 4 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). The Company will have a 37% interest in the joint venture. The Company has consolidated, and will continue to consolidate, the income statement and cash flow activities of Star India through the closing date, at which time the Company will recognize on its balance sheet the 37% investment at fair value. In addition, the Company will begin recognizing its proportional share of the joint venture's results in 'Equity in the income of investees, net' in the Consolidated Statement of Income. The equity earnings of the joint venture will not be reported in our segments' operating results.\n\n## Trends\n\nTo drive growth at our sports and entertainment businesses, we are, among other things, making strategic investments in our DTC offerings. Although there can be no assurances these investments will be successful, we expect that they will lead to growth in subscription fees and advertising revenues that will more than offset impacts on affiliate fees and advertising revenue from declines in linear network subscribers and the related decrease in average viewership, which we expect will continue.\n\n## CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\n\nWe believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Produced and Acquired/Licensed Content Costs\n\nWe amortize and test for impairment capitalized film and television production costs based on whether the content is predominantly monetized individually or as a group. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n\nProduction costs that are classified as individual are amortized based upon the ratio of the current period's revenues to the estimated remaining total revenues (Ultimate Revenues).",

This aligns with the broader trend of increased R&D spending across Alphabet, where compensation expenses rose by $3.5 billion due to an 11% increase in headcount. The connection suggests that Alphabet's strategic investment in talent and human capital\u2014especially within early-stage, high-potential ventures like Other Bets\u2014is contributing to both rising R&D costs and segment-specific operating losses, reflecting a deliberate trade-off between near-term financial performance and long-term innovation potential.",

Alphabet's  investment  in  the  portfolio  of  Other  Bets  includes  emerging  businesses  at  various  stages  of  development, ranging from those in the R&amp;D phase to those that are in the beginning stages of commercialization, and our goal is for them to become thriving, successful businesses in the medium to long term. While these early-stage businesses naturally come with considerable uncertainty, some of them are already generating revenue and making important strides in their industries.

We are investing in the portfolio of Other Bets and being very deliberate about the focus, scale, and pace of investments.\n\n## Competition\n\nOur  business  is  characterized  by  rapid  change  as  well  as  new  and  disruptive  technologies.  We  face  formidable competition in every aspect of our business, including from:\n\n- General  purpose  search  engines  and  information  services,  such  as  Baidu,  Microsoft's  Bing,  Naver,  Seznam, Yahoo, and Yandex.\n- Vertical search engines and e-commerce providers, such as Amazon and eBay (e-commerce), Booking's Kayak (travel queries), Microsoft's LinkedIn (job queries), and WebMD (health queries). Some users will navigate directly to such content, websites, and apps rather than go through Google.\n- Social networks offered by ByteDance, Meta, Snap, and Twitter. Some users increasingly rely on social networks for product or service referrals, rather than seeking information through traditional search engines.\n- Other online advertising platforms and networks, such as Amazon, AppNexus, Criteo, and Meta, that compete for advertisers that use Google Ads, our primary auction-based advertising platform.\n- Other  forms  of  advertising,  such  as  billboards,  magazines,  newspapers,  radio,  and  television.  Our  advertisers typically advertise in multiple media, both online and offline.\n- Companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer hardware products, including businesses that have developed proprietary platforms, such as Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft.\n- Digital assistant providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of enterprise cloud services, such as Alibaba, Amazon, Microsoft, and Salesforce.\n- Providers of digital video services, such as Amazon, Apple, AT&amp;T, ByteDance, Disney, Hulu, Meta, and Netflix.\n- Other digital content and application platform providers, such as Amazon and Apple.\n- Providers of workspace connectivity and productivity products, such as Meta, Microsoft, Salesforce, and Zoom.\n\nCompeting successfully depends heavily on our ability to develop and distribute innovative products and technologies to the marketplace across our businesses. Specifically, for advertising, competing successfully depends on attracting and retaining:\n\n- users, for whom other products and services are literally one click away, largely on the basis of the relevance of our advertising, as well as the general usefulness, security, and availability of our products and services;\n- advertisers, primarily based on our ability to generate sales leads, and ultimately customers, and to deliver their advertisements in an efficient and effective manner across a variety of distribution channels; and\n- content providers, primarily based on the quality of our advertiser base, our ability to help these partners generate revenues from advertising, and the terms of our agreements with them.\n\nFor additional information about competition, see Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.",

The segment generates significant revenue from subscription fees (e.g., Disney+, Hulu) and affiliate fees (e.g., ABC Network, Disney, Freeform, FX, National Geographic), which are tied to the same content that drives these capitalized production costs.

      "answer": "AT&T reported an operating loss of $8,492 million attributable to Acquisition-Related Items in 2022, as detailed in the Corporate and Other segment financials. This aligns with the company's rationale for excluding such items from segment performance evaluations, as stated in the segment reporting section, which emphasizes that Acquisition-Related Items consist of costs associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets. These exclusions are intended to preserve the comparability of segment results while operational plans and cost reduction initiatives are implemented.",

          "chunk_text": "- In November 2021, we sold our Vrio business unit, which provided video services primarily to residential customers using satellite technology in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\n## General\n\nWe are a leading provider of telecommunications, media and technology services globally. The services and products that we offer vary by market and utilize various technology platforms in a range of geographies. Our reportable segments are organized as follows:\n\nThe Communications segment provides services to businesses and consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our business strategies reflect bundled product offerings that cut across product lines and utilize shared assets. This segment contains the following business units:\n\n- Mobility provides nationwide wireless service and equipment.\n- Business Wireline provides advanced IP-based services, as well as traditional voice and data services to business customers.\n- Consumer Wireline provides internet, including broadband fiber, and legacy telephony voice communication services to residential customers.\n\nThe WarnerMedia segment develops, produces and distributes feature films, television, gaming and other content in various physical and digital formats globally. WarnerMedia content is distributed through basic networks, Direct-to-Consumer (DTC) or theatrical, TV content and games licensing. Segment results also include Xandr advertising and Otter Media Holdings (Otter Media). We disposed of substantially all Otter Media assets in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nOn May 17, 2021, we entered into an agreement to combine our WarnerMedia segment, subject to certain exceptions, with a subsidiary of Discovery, Inc. (Discovery). On December 21, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the marketplace component of Xandr to Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft). (See Note 6)\n\nThe Latin America segment provides wireless services and equipment in Mexico, and prior to the November 2021 disposition of Vrio, video services in Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nCorporate and Other reconciles our segment results to consolidated operating income and income before income taxes, and includes:\n\n- Corporate , which consists of: (1) businesses no longer integral to our operations or which we no longer actively market, (2) corporate support functions, (3) impacts of corporate-wide decisions for which the individual operating segments are not being evaluated, and (4) the reclassification of the amortization of prior service credits, which we continue to report with segment operating expenses, to consolidated 'Other income (expense) - net.' Costs previously allocated to the Video business that were retained after the transaction, net of reimbursements from DIRECTV under transition service agreements, are reported in Corporate following the transaction through 2022, to maintain comparability of our operating segment results, and while operational plans and continued cost reduction initiatives are implemented.\n- Video , which consists of our former U.S. video operations that were contributed to DIRECTV on July 31, 2021 and also includes our share of DIRECTV's earnings as equity in net income of affiliates (see Note 10).\n- Acquisition-related items , which consists of items associated with the merger and integration of acquired or divested businesses, including amortization of intangible assets.\n- Certain significant items , which includes (1) employee separation charges associated with voluntary and/or strategic offers, (2) asset impairments and abandonments, and (3) other items for which the segments are not being evaluated.\n- Eliminations and consolidations , which (1) removes transactions involving dealings between our segments, including channel distribution between WarnerMedia and Video prior to its separation, and (2) includes adjustments for our reporting of the advertising business.",

      "answer": "The consolidated financial results on page 41 show that Advertising revenue grew by 14% year-over-year, from $3,260 million to $3,707 million, contributing to a total revenue increase of 15%. Within the Entertainment segment, as outlined on page 37, Linear Networks is described as a key revenue driver that generates income primarily through affiliate fees and advertising. This aligns with the overall advertising growth reported company-wide. However, the segment discussion also highlights that Linear Networks incurs significant programming and production costs, including fees paid to the Sports segment and amortization of programming rights, which may constrain its operating income despite top-line advertising growth. Therefore, while Linear Networks contributes to the 14% advertising growth, its profitability may be pressured by the associated content and distribution costs, revealing a nuanced view of the segment's performance relative to the headline revenue increase.",

Despite revenue growth, the low profitability suggests potential underperformance relative to capital investments. This concern is reflected in the company\u2019s disclosure that Consumer Wireline is among the reporting units subjected to nonrecurring fair value measurements for impairment testing, using discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses.

      "answer": "The $14,700 million asset balance attributed to the Media segment at the end of 2021 reflects its significant role in content distribution, while the $3,672 million attributed to Studios indicates its role in content creation. The interdependence between these segments is evident through the content licensing revenue recognition process, where Studios licenses owned content to Media and Sky. Revenue from these licenses is recognized at a point in time by Studios when the content is delivered and made available for use, whereas Media recognizes the costs of these licenses over the license period as the content is used. This difference in timing of recognition results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits on these transactions are deferred in consolidated results and recognized over time. This reveals that the financial performance of Media is closely tied to the content produced by Studios, and the accounting treatment highlights the complexity of internal segment transactions.",

      "answer": "The net actuarial loss of $190 million for postretirement medical plans on page 105 indicates an unfavorable valuation change in future liabilities, which typically would pressure the company to increase funding. However, despite this loss and the master trust holding $278 million in Disney stock at the end of fiscal 2024 (page 107), the company has stated it does not expect to make material contributions to these plans in fiscal 2025. This suggests that the current asset base, including significant holdings of company stock, may be viewed as sufficient to cover near-term obligations despite the actuarial loss, reflecting a strategic funding decision based on actuarial projections and asset performance expectations.",

In such cases, the master trust would be contractually obligated to make a cash contribution at the time of the capital call. At September 28, 2024, the total committed capital still uncalled and unpaid was $1.5 billion.\n\n## Plan Contributions\n\nDuring fiscal 2024, the Company made $95 million of contributions to its pension and postretirement medical plans. The Company currently does not expect to make material pension and postretirement medical plan contributions in fiscal 2025. Final minimum funding requirements for fiscal 2025 will be determined based on a January 1, 2025 funding actuarial valuation, which is expected to be received during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.",

      "question": "How does the relative stability in Consumer Wireline revenue from 2020 to 2021 reconcile with the significant decline in its operating contribution over the same period?",
      "answer": "The Consumer Wireline segment reported revenues of $13,012 million in 2020 and $12,539 million in 2021, indicating only a modest decline. However, its operating contribution dropped from $2,357 million in 2020 to $977 million in 2021\u2014a decrease of 58.8%. This suggests a significant compression in operating margins, likely due to rising operating expenses outpacing the small revenue decline. The data from page 83 confirms that operating income for Consumer Wireline was $2,357 million in 2020, which aligns with the operating contribution. By 2021, the operating contribution had fallen to $977 million, showing a sharp margin contraction despite relatively stable revenues.",

      "answer": "T's Communications segment operating income margin declined from 23.6% in 2023 to 23.0% in 2024, primarily due to a drop in operating income from the Business Wireline unit, which saw its margin fall from 6.2% in 2023 to -0.5% in 2024. This decline was partially offset by an increase in operating income from the Mobility unit, which maintained a stable margin of 30.9% in 2024 compared to 30.8% in 2023. Therefore, while the overall Communications segment margin decreased, the Mobility unit remained resilient, and the Business Wireline unit's deterioration was the primary driver of the margin contraction.",

      "answer": "Disney's Postretirement Medical Plans' projected benefit obligation decreased from $2,121 million in fiscal 2021 to $1,539 million in fiscal 2022, driven by an actuarial gain of $595 million. This reduction in obligation corresponds to the Net Balance Sheet Liability of $790 million for fiscal 2022, which reflects the underfunded status of the plans. The funded status improved from a $1,232 million underfunded position in 2021 to $790 million in 2022, indicating a positive shift in the actuarial valuation and asset performance.",

      "answer": "Disney's Direct-to-Consumer segment experienced growth in existing markets, as evidenced by a 27% increase in subscription fees ($15.3 billion in 2022 vs. $12.0 billion in 2021), yet this growth was accompanied by a $2.3 billion year-over-year increase in operating loss, reaching $4.0 billion in 2022. This contradiction can be attributed to rising operating expenses, particularly technology and distribution costs at Disney+, which grew significantly due to expansion and market saturation efforts. The increased loss highlights the tension between scaling the platform and achieving profitability, suggesting that investment in growth outpaced revenue gains in the short term.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

      "question": "Given the increase in Cable Communications segment revenue to $64.3 billion in 2021 and the simultaneous decline in Voice Revenue by 3.3%, how does the overall growth in the Cable Communications segment align with the decreasing trend in Voice Revenue, and what does this suggest about Comcast's strategic positioning in the residential services market?",
      "answer": "The Cable Communications segment reported a 7.1% revenue increase to $64.3 billion in 2021, driven by growth in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, and video revenue. However, during the same period, Voice Revenue specifically declined by 3.3% to $3.417 billion. This divergence indicates that while the overall segment is growing, the voice service component is experiencing a structural decline, likely due to continued consumer shift toward mobile and VoIP alternatives. The segment\u2019s ability to grow despite this decline suggests that Comcast is successfully offsetting losses in traditional voice services through expansion in higher-growth areas like broadband and wireless. This aligns with a broader strategic shift toward digital and mobile-first residential offerings.",

For more information about our company's operations and the risks facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2021, and all amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Refer to Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, with the exception of the discussion and analysis related to our NBCUniversal segments, which is included below for all periods based on the updated segment structure.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications;  (2)  NBCUniversal  in  three  reportable  business  segments:  Media,  Studios  and  Theme  Parks  (collectively,  the 'NBCUniversal segments'); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment.\n\n## 2021 Developments\n\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:\n\n## Cable Communications\n\n- Revenue increased 7.1% to $64.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2% to $28.1 billion primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and technical and product support expenses.\n- Operating margin increased from 42.1% to 43.7%.",

In contrast, the costs associated with these licenses in the Media segment are recognized over the license period as the content is used. This difference in revenue and cost recognition timing results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact within the Eliminations section, where profits (or losses) from these intersegment transactions are deferred in the consolidated results and recognized gradually as the content is consumed over the license term.

      "answer": "Cable Communications contributed $950 million in acquisitions to Comcast's consolidated intangible asset spending in 2021, representing 97% of the $979 million total cash paid for intangible assets that year. This aligns with the segment's broader capital allocation strategy, as evidenced by its $16,192 million segment balance at the end of 2021, which increased from $15,264 million in 2020, indicating a strategic focus on growth through acquisitions and intangible investments. This contrasts with other segments like NBCUniversal and Sky, which saw balance reductions or more modest changes.",

      "answer": "The increase in cricket programming costs at Disney+ Hotstar was driven by two significant ICC tournaments in the current year compared to one in the prior year, which contributed to a rise in overall programming costs for the Direct-to-Consumer segment. However, this was partially offset by lower costs for non-sports content on Disney+. Despite the higher costs at Disney+ Hotstar, the segment reported an operating income of $143 million, a significant improvement from an operating loss of $2,496 million in the prior year. This suggests that while cricket programming costs increased, other cost management strategies and revenue improvements helped offset the expense, leading to a positive shift in operating performance.",

        "Hop 1: DIS(page_4) \u2192 Entertainment Segment: The Entertainment segment includes the Direct-to-Consumer line of business, which encompasses Disney+, Disney+ Hotstar, and Hulu, and generates revenue primarily from subscription fees and advertising.",
        "Hop 2: Entertainment Segment \u2192 Programming Costs: The Entertainment segment incurs programming and production costs, which include amortization of capitalized production costs, licensed programming rights, subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, and content-specific expenses such as cricket programming at Disney+ Hotstar.",

      "answer": "Disney's Direct-to-Consumer business segment generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales, and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees, as outlined in the business segment results. This indicates that advertising sales are a core revenue driver for the segment. However, in the cautionary note on forward-looking statements, Disney explicitly highlights risks tied to 'consumer preferences and acceptance of our content, offerings, pricing model and price increases and the market for advertising sales on our direct-to-consumer services and linear networks.' These forward-looking concerns suggest that shifts in consumer behavior or a weakened advertising market could materially impact the profitability of the Direct-to-Consumer segment. By connecting these two sections, it becomes evident that while advertising sales are strategically embedded in the segment\u2019s revenue model, they are also exposed to external market volatility, which Disney acknowledges as a risk that could undermine its business plans and financial performance.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

The decline in revenues contributed to a significant drop in Segment Operating Income for Business Wireline, which fell 43.7% year-over-year (from $2,290M to $1,289M), thereby negatively affecting the overall Segment Operating Income growth trajectory despite gains in other segments like Mobility.",

      "answer": "AT&T highlights EBITDA margin as a key performance metric for the Consumer Wireline segment, showing consistent growth from 29.8% in 2022 to 33.4% in 2024, suggesting stable cash generation potential. However, the company also subjected the Consumer Wireline reporting unit to nonrecurring fair value measurements using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches due to impairment indicators. This implies that despite the positive EBITDA margin trend, there may be underlying concerns about the segment's long-term value or performance sustainability. The contrast between the positive EBITDA narrative and the need for impairment testing reveals a nuanced financial picture where short-term operating metrics may not fully reflect long-term risk.",

EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses.

Since tax incentives lower the cost basis of content assets, the overall amortization expense is reduced, which in turn moderates the potential volatility in financial results that could arise from changes in estimated viewing patterns.

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting, and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and EBITDA margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\n",

This sharp decline indicates significant financial stress across the business, including in the Business Wireline segment, which likely contributed to the impairment indicators that triggered nonrecurring fair value measurements for that segment in 2024.",

      "question": "Given the minimal Non-GAAP adjustments to Reality Labs' segment assets over the 2022\u20132024 periods, how does the lack of significant adjustments align with the segment's substantial investment of $19.88 billion in 2024 and its characterization as a long-term, loss-generating initiative dependent on profits from other areas of the business?",
      "answer": "The minimal Non-GAAP adjustments to Reality Labs' segment assets\u2014only $5 million in 2022 and $5 million in 2023\u2014suggest that the reported asset values for the segment are largely consistent with GAAP figures, indicating limited exclusions or modifications for non-recurring or non-cash items. Despite this, Reality Labs received a significant portion of Meta\u2019s investment in 2024, with $19.88 billion allocated to the segment, which is described as a long-term, loss-generating initiative. This contrast highlights that while the segment's asset base is relatively transparent under GAAP, its financial performance is heavily dependent on continued investment from Meta\u2019s more profitable segments, such as the Family of Apps, which generated the majority of the company's revenue. The lack of major adjustments implies that the financial burden of Reality Labs is not being materially softened by accounting treatments, reinforcing the strategic risk of allocating such a large portion of resources to a segment expected to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future.",

Business\n\n## Overview\n\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\n\nWe build technology that helps people connect and share, find and build communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people to connect and share  with  friends  and  family  through  mobile  devices,  personal  computers,  virtual  reality  (V R)  and  mix ed  reality  (MR)  headsets,  augmented  reality  (AR),  and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos, videos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build the next computing platform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\n\nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\n\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\n\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery engine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure capacity.\n\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the nex t computing platform is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.",

This growth in equity income suggests that other investees outside of Star India must have performed strongly enough to offset Star India's deterioration. Meanwhile, the Experiences segment reported a 5% revenue increase from $32,549 million to $34,151 million, indicating stronger performance in that business area. While the Experiences segment growth reflects direct revenue from Disney's own operations, the Equity in Income of Investees metric reflects returns from external investments, suggesting that Disney's broader portfolio of investees\u2014despite challenges with Star India\u2014contributed positively to earnings through other sources.",

      "question": "How does the decline in amortization costs from $1,998 million in 2023 to $1,677 million in 2024 relate to the Entertainment segment's revenue allocation and cost structure, particularly in light of its content licensing and distribution activities?",
      "answer": "The decline in amortization costs from $1,998 million in 2023 to $1,677 million in 2024 reflects a reduction in the step-up of film and episodic costs, which dropped from $439 million to $271 million. This decrease is relevant to the Entertainment segment, as it directly allocates amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights across its businesses, particularly in content licensing and distribution. Given that the Entertainment segment reported $2,645 million in TV/VOD distribution licensing revenue in 2023\u2014part of its broader $40,635 million revenue\u2014this suggests that the segment continues to rely heavily on content monetization, even as amortization costs decline. The reduction in amortization may signal lower recent investment in new content or more efficient amortization of existing assets, which could affect profitability and cash flow in content-driven revenue streams.",

      "question": "How does NBCUniversal's 6% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $5.7 billion reconcile with the specific risks outlined regarding the negative impact of capacity restrictions at Universal Beijing Resort on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA?",
      "answer": "NBCUniversal reported a 6% increase in Adjusted EBITDA to $5.7 billion in 2021, driven by strong performance in its Theme Parks segment, which saw Adjusted EBITDA rebound from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, partly due to the opening of Universal Beijing Resort in September 2021. However, the Universal Beijing Resort operated under capacity restrictions during its initial months, which had a measurable negative impact on consolidated Adjusted EBITDA. This illustrates that while the Theme Parks segment benefited from the new resort's launch, its full financial potential was constrained by pandemic-related restrictions. The reconciliation shows that despite the positive growth in Adjusted EBITDA, the company still faced material headwinds from limited attendance at the Beijing park, highlighting the sensitivity of NBCUniversal's profitability to operational capacity and external health conditions.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

This decline of over $2.8 billion in net assets reflects impairments and currency exchange impacts, despite the broader company reporting a 17% year-over-year increase in total segment operating revenues.

This aligns with the discussion in the risk factors section, which highlights that capacity restrictions at theme parks significantly impacted consolidated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the Sky segment's contribution to cash paid for intangible assets in 2021 compare with its role in the overall asset composition of CMCSA as of the end of 2021?",
      "answer": "The Sky segment contributed $707 million to CMCSA's total cash paid for intangible assets in 2021, representing a significant portion of the $2,475 million consolidated total. As of the end of 2021, Sky's balance stood at $29,196 million, making it one of the largest components in CMCSA's asset composition, second only to the 'Cable Communications' segment at $16,192 million. This indicates that while Sky remains a substantial asset holder, it also contributes disproportionately to intangible investments compared to other segments.",

      "answer": "Disney's total programming and production costs of $14.081 billion in 2024 include significant investments in content creation and licensing. However, the $257 million impairment charge for licensed programming rights in 2023, disclosed in restructuring and impairment charges, indicates that not all licensed content generated expected returns. This is tied to the Entertainment segment's discussion of amortization strategies, where licensed programming rights are capitalized and amortized based on distribution window values. The impairment suggests that the valuation assumptions used in prior periods may have been overly optimistic, raising concerns about the sustainability of content investment strategies and their alignment with actual consumer demand or platform performance.",

Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

These costs are a key component of the segment's operating expenses and are tied to the growth and scalability of streaming services.

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

      "answer": "The Sports segment reports that programming and production costs, which include live sports content, are a primary component of its operating expenses. Despite this continued investment, total programming and production costs for DIS increased only slightly from $13,959 million in 2023 to $14,081 million in 2024. This marginal 1% increase occurred alongside declines in content spending for Disney+ and Hulu, which fell by 3% ($5,694M to $5,499M) and 4% ($8,265M to $8,582M), respectively. This suggests that while the Sports segment is likely driving upward pressure on programming costs through live sports investments, these increases are being partially offset by reductions in other areas, particularly in streaming content.",

      "question": "Given that Disney's lessee payments from park properties are primarily variable based on lessee sales, how does the company's exposure to variable payments in its sports programming rights commitments compare in terms of financial risk management and revenue predictability?",
      "answer": "Disney reports that the majority of its $0.6 billion in lessee revenues from fiscal 2024 are variable, tied directly to lessee sales at parks and experiences. This creates revenue volatility dependent on third-party performance. Similarly, the document indicates that certain sports programming rights\u2014covering NBA, NFL, MLB, and others\u2014also carry variable payment terms based on revenues, though these are not included in the fixed commitment tables. While both revenue streams rely on variable payment structures, the lessee model generates income from third-party operators, whereas the programming rights represent variable cost exposure. This distinction means Disney faces dual sensitivity to revenue fluctuations\u2014both as a recipient in its leasing business and as a payer in content acquisition\u2014requiring differentiated risk mitigation strategies for each.",

(2)\n\n## Legal Matters\n\nOn May 12, 2023, a private securities class action lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California against the Company, its former Chief Executive Officer, Robert Chapek, its former Chief Financial Officer, Christine M. McCarthy, and the former Chairman of the Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, Kareem Daniel on behalf of certain purchasers of securities of the Company (the 'Securities Class Action'). On November 6, 2023, a consolidated complaint was filed in the same action, adding Robert Iger, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, as a defendant. Claims in the Securities Class Action include (i) violations of Section 10(b) of the Ex change Act and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder against all defendants, (ii) violations of Section 20A of the Exchange Act against Iger and McCarthy, and (iii) violations of Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act against all defendants. Plaintiffs in the Securities Class Action allege purported misstatements and omissions concerning, and a scheme to conceal, accurate costs and subscriber growth of the Disney+ platform. Plaintiffs seek unspecified damages, plus interest and costs and fees. The Company intends to defend against the lawsuit vigorously and filed a motion to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim on December 21, 2023. A hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on September 27, 2024. The lawsuit is in the early stages and at this time we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of any possible loss.\n\nThree shareholder derivative complaints have been filed. The first, in which Hugues Gervat is the plaintiff, was filed on August 4, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The second, in which Stourbridge Investments LLC is the plaintiff, was filed on August 23, 2023 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware. And the third, in which Audrey McAdams is the Plaintiff, was filed on December 15, 2023, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Each named The Walt Disney Company as a nominal defendant and alleged claims on its behalf against the Company's Chief Executive Officer, Robert Iger; its former Chief Ex ecutive Officer, Robert Chapek; its former Chief Financial Officer, Christine M. McCarthy; the former Chairman of the Disney Media and Entertainment Distribution segment, Kareem Daniel, and ten current and former members of the Disney Board (Susan E. Arnold; Mary T. Barra; Safra A. Catz; Amy L. Chang; Francis A. deSouza; Michael B.G. Froman; Maria Elena Lagomasino; Calvin R. McDonald; Mark G. Parker; and Derica W. Rice). Along with alleged violations of Sections 10(b), 14(a), 20(a), and Rule 10b-5 of the Securities Ex change Act, premised on similar allegations as the Securities Class Action, plaintiffs seek to recover under various theories including breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, abuse of control, gross mismanagement and waste. On October 24, 2023, the Stourbridge action was voluntarily dismissed and, on November 16, 2023, was refiled in Delaware state court alleging analogous theories of liability based on state law. On October 30, 2023, the Gervat action was stayed pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss filed in the Securities Class Action. The Stourbridge action was likewise stayed under an order entered December 12, 2023 and the McAdams action was stayed under an order entered February 20, 2024. The actions seek declarative and injunctive relief, an award of unspecified damages to The Walt Disney Company and other costs and fees. The Company intends to defend against",

      "question": "How does the increase in subscriber-based fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment for programming Hulu Live relate to the overall change in programming and production costs, particularly given the $8.582 billion in programming costs attributed to Hulu in fiscal 2024?",
      "answer": "The subscriber-based fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment for programming Hulu Live are a component of the broader programming and production costs. In fiscal 2024, Hulu's portion of programming and production costs totaled $8.582 billion, representing a 4% increase compared to fiscal 2023. This increase aligns with the growing expense associated with subscriber-based fees for Hulu Live, which are used to license content from the Sports segment and other Entertainment businesses. Despite a slight overall change in total programming and production costs (-1%), Hulu's segment saw a notable rise, indicating a strategic emphasis or rising costs in live programming content. This suggests that the Sports segment's role in supplying content to Hulu Live is a growing cost driver within the broader context of Disney's programming and production strategy.",

      "question": "How does AT&T's emphasis on EBITDA margin as a key performance metric align with the specific 1.2 percentage point increase in Communications segment EBITDA margin from 2023 to 2024, given the broader context of declining operating revenues?",
      "answer": "AT&T highlights EBITDA margin as a critical metric for evaluating segment performance and cash generation potential, particularly relevant given the 1.2 percentage point increase in the Communications segment EBITDA margin from 38.3% in 2023 to 39.5% in 2024. Despite this margin improvement, operating revenues declined in 2024 due to drops in Business Wireline and Mobility equipment revenue, partially offset by gains in Mobility service and Consumer Wireline broadband. This suggests that while the company is managing costs and improving efficiency within the Communications segment, broader revenue pressures persist, making the EBITDA margin growth more reflective of operational discipline than top-line strength.",

EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses.

      "answer": "Mobility, a core part of the Communications Segment, generated $83,982 million in operating revenues in 2023, reflecting a 2.7% increase from 2022. The Communications Segment, which includes Mobility, accounted for 97% of total segment operating revenues and saw a segment operating income increase of 4.0% year-over-year. However, in 2023, the company revised its reporting methodology by removing prior service credits from segment operating expenses, which increased the Communications Segment\u2019s operations and support expenses by approximately $2,400 million in 2022 and $2,100 million in 2021. This change, while not affecting consolidated results, may have impacted the segment\u2019s expense structure and margin dynamics. Therefore, despite Mobility\u2019s modest revenue growth, the increased operational expenses due to the revised reporting could have placed upward pressure on segment-level costs, potentially affecting profitability trends even as overall revenues rose.",

      "answer": "Disney reported a 4% increase in Hulu's programming and production costs in fiscal 2024, with total costs reaching $8,582 million. These costs include subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, which are paid to the Sports segment and other internal businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live. Meanwhile, the Sports segment earns revenue from these same fees, as Hulu pays for the right to include ESPN and other sports content on Hulu Live. This creates a dual impact: the Entertainment segment records a rising expense tied to Hulu Live programming, while the Sports segment recognizes corresponding revenue, highlighting an internal transfer pricing dynamic that affects both segments' operating results.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "question": "How does Disney's mention of real estate rent and sales as a revenue source for DPEP reconcile with the segment's static carrying value on the balance sheet, despite significant capital investments in parks and real estate developments?",
      "answer": "Disney's DPEP segment generates revenue from real estate rent and sales, as noted in the detailed revenue breakdown on page 17. This revenue stream is tied to the parks' physical footprint and developments like Walt Disney World Resort, which spans 25,000 acres and includes extensive real estate assets such as hotels, vacation club properties, and retail spaces. However, the balance sheet on page 83 shows DPEP's carrying value remained unchanged at $5,550 million from 2021 to 2022, despite significant capital expenditures being allocated to parks and real estate developments in recent years. This suggests that either the real estate assets are being depreciated at a rate that offsets new investments, or the carrying value does not fully reflect the market value appreciation of these properties, potentially masking the true economic value of DPEP's real estate holdings.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

This decline in Business Wireline revenue, which also saw a 43.7% drop in operating income, signals significant pressure on legacy services. On the strategic front, AT&T reports expanding fiber broadband to 8.3 million consumer wireline customers by the end of 2023, adding 1.1 million during the year, and extending 5G coverage to 302 million people in the U.S. These investments indicate a pivot toward next-generation infrastructure to drive growth.

      "question": "Given that the Family of Apps segment accounted for 79% of total costs and expenses in 2024, how does the segment's income from operations of $87.1 billion reconcile with the company's overall income from operations of $69.4 billion, and what does this imply about the financial contribution and strategic importance of the Reality Labs segment?",
      "answer": "The Family of Apps segment reported income from operations of $87.1 billion in 2024, while the company's overall income from operations was $69.4 billion. This indicates that the Reality Labs segment, which operated at a loss of $17.7 billion in the same period, significantly offset the profitability of the Family of Apps. Despite the substantial investment in the Family of Apps (79% of total costs), the losses from Reality Labs reduced the overall operational income. This highlights the strategic trade-off Meta is making\u2014using the strong profitability of its core social media platforms to fund long-term, high-risk innovation in areas like the metaverse and wearables, which are not yet profitable but are positioned as future growth drivers.",

Business\n\n## Overview\n\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\n\nWe build technology that helps people connect and share, find and build communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people to connect and share  with  friends  and  family  through  mobile  devices,  personal  computers,  virtual  reality  (V R)  and  mix ed  reality  (MR)  headsets,  augmented  reality  (AR),  and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos, videos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build the next computing platform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\n\nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\n\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\n\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery engine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure capacity.\n\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the nex t computing platform is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.",

      "question": "Despite WarnerMedia's $1.94 billion reduction in asset balance in 2021, its capital expenditures increased slightly from $699 million to $764 million. How does this investment pattern compare to T's overall capital expenditure strategy, where the total company spent $16.5 billion across segments?",
      "answer": "WarnerMedia's capital expenditure increased by $65 million (from $699 million to $764 million) in 2021 even as its asset balance declined by $1.94 billion, indicating a net divestiture or restructuring activity. Meanwhile, T's total capital expenditures across all segments rose to $16.5 billion in 2021 from $15.7 billion in 2020. This suggests WarnerMedia was selectively investing in strategic assets despite an overall reduction in its asset base, while the broader company was increasing capital spending across other segments like Communications and Latin America. The contrast highlights WarnerMedia's potentially more aggressive restructuring or reallocation approach compared to the company's overall capital deployment strategy.",

      "answer": "The 10% year-over-year increase in total cost of revenues to $146.3 billion was primarily driven by increases in content acquisition costs, TAC, and depreciation expense. TAC itself increased from $50.886 billion in 2023 to $54.900 billion in 2024, reflecting a growing reliance on distribution and network partners. Meanwhile, other cost of revenues, which includes content acquisition costs, rose from $82.446 billion to $91.406 billion, indicating that the growth in content licensing fees for platforms like YouTube also significantly contributed to the overall cost increase.

Certain  of  our  costs  and  expenses,  including  those  associated  with  the  operation  of  our technical infrastructure as well as components of our operating expenses, are generally less v ariable in nature and may not correlate to changes in rev enue. Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices.

      "answer": "The Family of Apps segment reported a 39% increase in operating income, rising from $62,871 million in 2023 to $87,109 million in 2024, indicating strong profitability growth. However, this growth occurred alongside restructuring charges tied to the 2022 restructuring, which included layoffs of employees within the segment and facility consolidations. These restructuring activities, completed by December 2024, likely contributed to cost control and operational efficiency, supporting the improved operating margin of 54% in 2024 compared to 47% in 2023.

      "answer": "The net actuarial loss for postretirement medical plans decreased from a loss of $13 million in fiscal 2021 to a gain of $595 million in fiscal 2022, contributing to a reduction in the projected benefit obligation from $2,121 million to $1,539 million. This significant actuarial gain also helped reduce the underfunded status of the plans from $1,232 million to $790 million. The actuarial gain likely reflects favorable changes in assumptions or market conditions affecting the valuation of future liabilities, which improved the funded status despite ongoing obligations and benefit payments.",

      "answer": "The increase in Business Services Connectivity Costs and Expenses in 2024 was driven in part by higher Direct Product Costs, which include access fees for using third-party wireless and broadband networks to deliver services. These access fees are a core component of Direct Product Costs and directly support the delivery of services that generate Business Services Connectivity revenue, such as broadband and wireless offerings for small businesses and enterprise solutions. Since Business Services Connectivity revenue increased due to growth in enterprise solutions and higher small business rates, the rise in Direct Product Costs reflects the necessary infrastructure investment to support this growth. This interplay shows that rising service delivery costs are tied to expanded business offerings and increased service demand.",

While Google Services' operating income increased by $25.4 billion, this growth was partially offset by increases in both content acquisition costs and TAC.

Additionally, fluctuations in employee compensation expenses may not directly correlate with changes in headcount, due to factors such as annual stock-based compensation (SBC) awards that generally v est ov er four years.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of rev enues is comprised of TAC and other costs of rev enues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- amounts paid to our distribution partners who make av ailable our search access points and serv ices. Our distribution partners include browser prov iders, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software dev elopers; and\n- amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of rev enues primarily includes:\n- content  acquisition  costs,  which  are  payments  to  content  prov iders  from  whom  we  license  v ideo  and  other  content  for  distribution, primarily related to YouTube (we pay fees to these content prov iders based on rev enues generated, subscriber counts, or a flat fee);\n- depreciation expense related to our technical infrastructure;\n- employee compensation expenses related to our technical infrastructure and other operations such as content rev iew and customer and product support;\n- inv entory and other costs related to the dev ices we sell; and\n- other technical infrastructure operations costs, including network capacity, energy, and equipment costs.\n\nTAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties are significantly higher than TAC as a percentage of rev enues generated from ads placed on Google Search &amp; other properties, because most of the adv ertiser rev enues from ads serv ed on Google Network properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\n\n## Operating Expenses",

      "answer": "Despite the negative impact of the pandemic on Sky's direct-to-consumer revenue, particularly due to closures of commercial customers' locations and delays in sports seasons, Sky's Adjusted EBITDA increased by 20.8% to $2.4 billion. This apparent contradiction is explained by cost management and revenue diversification strategies, including decreases in programming and production expenses, which offset some of the revenue losses. Additionally, Sky reported revenue growth from advertising and direct-to-consumer segments, despite the impact of reduced broadcast rights for Serie A. The segment\u2019s ability to increase Adjusted EBITDA despite these challenges suggests strong operational discipline and a shift toward more resilient revenue streams. This is further supported by Sky\u2019s integration with Peacock, which expanded content offerings and potentially improved customer retention.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, revenue in the Media segment increased 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n- Media segment results include the operations of Peacock, which in 2021 generated revenue of $778 million and operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion, compared to revenue of $118 million and operating costs and expenses of $781 million in 2020. We continued to invest in content and grow our customer base during 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced certain ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n- Studios segment revenue increased 16.2% to $9.4 billion, due to increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue and  home  entertainment  and  other  revenue  as  our  film  and  television  production  operations  returned  to  full  capacity. Studios revenue included licenses of content to our Media and other segments, including the impact of a new licensing agreement  for  content  that  became  exclusively  available  for  streaming  on  Peacock  in  2021,  and  the  impacts  of  initial content licenses associated with the launch of Peacock in 2020, which are eliminated in consolidation.\n- Theme Parks segment revenue increased 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the operation of our theme parks in the current year period compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period and the opening of our theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\n- Revenue increased 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue increased 3.1% due to increases  in  advertising  and  direct-to-consumer  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  content  revenue,  which  were affected by COVID-19 in the prior year period and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period.\n- Adjusted  EBITDA increased  20.8%  to  $2.4  billion.  Excluding  the  impact  of  foreign  currency,  Sky Adjusted  EBITDA increased 10.2% primarily due to increases in revenue and decreases in programming and production expenses, partially offset by increases in direct network costs and other expenses.\n\n## Other\n\n- Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA losses decreased from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year period in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses.\n- Resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021. We repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion in 2021. Raised our dividend by $0.08 to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis in January 2021 and paid $4.5 billion of dividends in 2021.\n- Reduced debt by $8.9 billion in 2021 and ended the year with $94.8 billion of total short-term and long-term debt and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Impacts of COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways, with the most significant effects in 2020, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such\n\n## Sky",

      "answer": "The Cable Communications segment reported $25,270 million in Adjusted EBITDA in 2021, indicating strong operational performance. However, this was partially offset by significant pandemic-related disruptions in other segments, particularly in Theme Parks and Studios, which reported negative Adjusted EBITDA of $477 million and $1,041 million respectively. Despite the strength in Cable Communications, the consolidated Adjusted EBITDA of $30,826 million reflects the drag from these pandemic-impacted segments, showing that while one segment thrived, others faced material challenges.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the 1.5% year-over-year growth in Mobility revenues reported within the Communications segment reconcile with the $23,812 million in operating income attributed to Mobility on a standalone basis, and what does this imply about the internal profitability dynamics of the Mobility business?",
      "answer": "The 1.5% year-over-year growth in Mobility revenues, which increased from $83,982 million in 2023 to $85,255 million in 2024, is accompanied by a smaller 1.8% increase in Mobility's segment operating income, rising from $25,861 million to $26,314 million. However, when examining the standalone operating income for Mobility at $23,812 million in 2024, which was $2,290 million in 2022 and $25,861 million in 2023, there appears to be a divergence between the segment-reported operating income and the standalone figure. This discrepancy suggests that while Mobility's top-line growth is modest, its internal cost structure or allocation of shared expenses may be affecting its standalone profitability more significantly than what is reflected in the broader Communications segment reporting.",

      "answer": "Disney disclosed a $187 million impairment charge for licensed programming rights in fiscal 2024, which is part of the 'Costs of services' in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These licensed programming rights are included in the broader category of programming and production costs, which totaled $14.081 billion in fiscal 2024 for the Entertainment segment. The impairment charge reflects a write-down of specific licensed content assets, likely due to changes in expected returns or strategic shifts, while the overall programming and production costs include amortization of both produced and licensed content across platforms like Hulu and Disney+. This indicates that impairment charges for licensed programming rights represent a small but significant portion of the broader content amortization strategy, which directly affects segment profitability and cash flow.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "The $131 million increase in personnel-related costs in Sales and Marketing expenses is attributed to the growth in advertising sales headcount, which directly reflects Netflix's focus on expanding its advertising sales team. This payroll expense is part of broader personnel-related costs that also feed into Technology and Development Expenses, which include payroll, stock-based compensation, and facilities for technology personnel working on service improvements such as user interface, recommendations, and infrastructure.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nare collected from members and remitted to governmental authorities. The Company is the principal in all its relationships where partners, including consumer electronics (\"CE\") manufacturers, multichannel video programming distributors (\"MVPDs\"), mobile operators and internet service providers (\"ISPs\"), provide access to the service as the Company retains control over service delivery to its members. In circumstances in which the price that the member pays is established by a partner and there is no standalone price for the Netflix  service (for instance, in a bundle), the net amount collected from the partner is recognized as revenue.\n\nThe Company also earns revenue from advertisements presented on its streaming service, consumer products, live events and various other sources. Revenues earned from sources other than monthly membership fees were not a material component of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022. See Note 2 Revenue Recognition to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding revenues.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nSales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising expenses and certain payments made to marketing and advertising sales partners, including CE manufacturers, MVPDs, mobile operators and ISPs. Sales and marketing expenses also include payroll, stock-based compensation, facilities, and other related expenses for personnel that support the Company's advertising sales and marketing activities. Marketing expenses are expensed as incurred and include promotional activities such as digital and television advertising. Advertising ex penses were $1,779 million, $1,732 million and $1,586 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nThe Company records a provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences of the reported results of operations using the asset and liability method. Deferred income taxes are recognized by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax  bases as well as net operating loss and tax  credit carryforwards. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax  rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The measurement of deferred tax  assets is reduced, if necessary, by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain. The Company accounts for the tax effects of global intangible low tax income as a current period expense.\n\nThe Company does not recognize certain tax benefits from uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes. The Company may recognize a tax benefit only if it is more likely than not the tax  position will be sustained on ex amination by the tax ing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon settlement. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense. See Note 10 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes.\n\n## Foreign Currency\n\nThe functional currency for the Company's subsidiaries is determined based on the primary economic environment in which the subsidiary operates. The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U.S. dollar functional currency subsidiaries into U.S. dollars using ex change rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenues and expenses for these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in cumulative translation adjustment included in \"Accumulated other comprehensive income\" in Stockholders' equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\nThe Company remeasures monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period. Gains and losses from these remeasurements are recognized in \"Interest and other income (expense)\" in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Foreign exchange gains (losses) were $(18) million, $(293) million, and $282 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively. These gains and losses were primarily due to the non-cash remeasurement of our Senior Notes denominated in euros and the remeasurement of cash and content liability positions denominated in currencies other than functional currencies. Foreign exchange gains (losses) for the year ended December 31, 2024 were net of hedging impacts. No hedging gains or losses were recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. See Note 7 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities for further information.\n\n## Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\n\nThe Company uses derivative and non-derivative instruments to manage foreign exchange risk related to its ongoing business operations with the primary objective of reducing earnings and cash flow volatility associated with fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\n\nThe Company recognizes derivative instruments at fair value as either assets (presented in 'Other current assets' and 'Other non-current assets') or liabilities (presented in 'Accrued expenses and other liabilities' and 'Other non-current liabilities') on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies derivative instruments in the Level 2 category within the fair value hierarchy.\n\n## Cash flow hedges",

      "answer": "CMCSA's Sky segment decreased its programming and production costs between 2020 and 2021 due to cost management efforts and foreign currency effects (page 46). However, consolidated programming and production costs increased significantly from $33,121 million in 2020 to $38,450 million in 2021 (page 83), indicating that other segments like NBCUniversal and Cable Communications substantially increased their content spending during the same period.

Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining our 2016 through 2018 tax returns. We have also received tax assessments in multiple foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or  permanent establishment. We continue to defend any and all such claims as presented.\n\nThe tax years 2014 through 2020 remain subject to examination by the appropriate governmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in various other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in various taxing jurisdictions.\n\nWe believe that an adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations.

If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are resolved in  a  manner  not  consistent  with  management's  expectations,  we  could  be  required  to  adjust  our  provision  for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain,  it  is  reasonably  possible  that  our  unrecognized  tax  benefits  from  certain  U.S.  federal,  state  and  non  U.S.  tax positions  could  decrease  by  approximately  $2.0  billion  in  the  next  12  months.

Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\n\nWe report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\n- Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales of apps and inapp purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription-based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\n- Google Cloud includes Google's infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform services, Google Workspace collaboration tools and other enterprise services.\n- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\n\nRevenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.",

      "answer": "Disney's 2024 10-K filing highlights a strategic intent to increase investment in the Experiences segment, which includes theme parks, resorts, and cruise operations. However, the document also notes that inflationary pressures, particularly on labor and supply chain costs, are expected to keep certain costs elevated. The Experiences segment's significant expenses include 'costs of goods sold'\u2014a line item that directly impacts profitability. On page 12, the filing lists 'costs of goods sold' as a major expense category for Experiences, alongside labor and infrastructure costs. This aligns with the discussion on page 20, which states that 'even if inflationary pressures moderate, we expect certain costs, such as for labor, to remain elevated.' The interplay between rising costs and strategic investment suggests that while Disney is doubling down on its Experiences business, it faces structural cost challenges that could constrain margin expansion or require price increases that may dampen demand. This creates a tension between growth strategy and cost containment in a high-inflation environment.",

While a number of different factors affect the demand for our products and services, actual or perceived economic conditions could contribute to lower attendance or spending at our parks and experiences businesses, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products and linear platforms, subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC platforms or licensing fees, while also continuing to increase the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Even if inflationary pressures moderate, we expect certain costs, such as for labor, to remain elevated. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and ex periences we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs, including borrowing costs as a result of elevated interest rates, making it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations and investments on favorable terms. A decline in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated could impact implementation or success of our business plans, such as our plans to increase investment in our Experiences segment, the realignment of our cost structure and plans for our DTC ad-supported services, enhancements, pricing structure and price increases. Unfavorable economic conditions also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. The adverse impact on our businesses of actual or perceived declines in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated will depend, in part, on their severity and duration and our ability to mitigate these impacts on our businesses is limited.\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses.\n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses, including by impacting the cost in U.S. dollars of providing our goods and services, our revenues in U.S. dollars generated by our international businesses and the international demand for our domestic products and services. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar adversely impacts the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and contributes to reduced international demand for our domestic products and services, including international travel to our domestic parks and resorts. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar often increases the cost of labor, goods and services in, or originating from, non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in certain countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries.\n\n## Changes in technology, in consumer consumption patterns and in how entertainment products are created affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products and the cost of producing or distributing these products.\n\nThe media entertainment and technology businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to new technologies including shifting patterns of content consumption and how entertainment products are generated. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. These developments have impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast and cable television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels. These developments have decreased advertising and affiliate revenue at some of our linear networks and have led, and may lead in the future, to the impairment of the value of certain of our assets. In addition, theater-going to watch movies has remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRules governing new technological developments, such as developments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI and large language model tools, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue streams for the use of our IP, how we create our entertainment products and the competition we face. In order to respond to the impact of new technologies on our businesses, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement new initiatives and changes to our business models, including by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, reorganizing our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies and developing new media offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, new media offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to technological changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution impacts the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. As part of our DTC strategy, we forgo certain revenue from certain traditional sources as we invest in our DTC offerings. Since launch, our DTC streaming services experienced significant losses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will each be or remain profitable or be as profitable over the long term as our historic business models.",

This apparent contradiction can be explained by the segment\u2019s significant revenue growth over the same period. Total Segment Operating Revenues rose from $3,144 million in 2022 to $4,232 million in 2024, a 34.6% increase.

      "answer": "Disney's 2023 10-K reveals that competitive pressures led to higher marketing costs, which contributed to a $406 million increase in SG&A expenses in one segment. However, in another segment, SG&A costs decreased by $487 million, primarily due to lower theatrical marketing costs from fewer major releases. This contrast highlights how different business units experienced opposing cost dynamics: while one segment faced rising marketing expenses due to competition, another benefited from reduced marketing spend tied to content release strategy. The interplay between these segments shows how competitive pressures and internal content scheduling decisions created divergent SG&A cost trends across the company.",

      "answer": "Despite Disney's explicit risk disclosures on page 23 about economic downturns reducing consumer spending on discretionary services like entertainment, the Direct-to-Consumer segment achieved a 20% increase in subscription fees in fiscal 2022. This apparent contradiction is partially explained by the flexible cost allocation strategy described on page 39, which allows the company to shift content and marketing costs between segments to optimize performance during economic volatility. The growth in subscription revenue suggests that Disney's streaming services were perceived as relatively affordable discretionary spending options, even as the company remained exposed to potential future economic sensitivity, particularly in international markets affected by foreign exchange fluctuations.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

      "answer": "The Cable Communications segment reported a 7.1% revenue increase to $64.3 billion in 2021, driven by growth in broadband, wireless, and business services. This growth came alongside an increase in Technical and Product Support Expenses, which rose due to higher costs associated with wireless phone service, including device sales and customer growth. Despite these rising expenses, the segment's operating margin improved from 42.1% to 43.7%, indicating that the revenue gains outpaced cost increases. This suggests that while the segment is investing more in technical and product support\u2014likely to sustain subscriber and service growth\u2014it is still managing to improve profitability, pointing to a favorable revenue-cost dynamic and effective cost management in higher-margin areas.",

For more information about our company's operations and the risks facing our businesses, see Item 1: Business and Item 1A: Risk Factors, respectively. As discussed in Note 2, we changed the presentation of our segment operating results in 2021, and all amounts are presented on a consistent basis under the new segment structure. Refer to Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for  management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019, with the exception of the discussion and analysis related to our NBCUniversal segments, which is included below for all periods based on the updated segment structure.\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are a global media and technology company with three primary businesses: Comcast Cable, NBCUniversal and Sky. We present our operations in five reportable business segments (1) Comcast Cable in one reportable business segment, referred to as Cable Communications;  (2)  NBCUniversal  in  three  reportable  business  segments:  Media,  Studios  and  Theme  Parks  (collectively,  the 'NBCUniversal segments'); and (3) Sky in one reportable business segment.\n\n## 2021 Developments\n\nThe following are the more significant developments in our businesses during 2021:\n\n## Cable Communications\n\n- Revenue increased 7.1% to $64.3 billion, reflecting increases in broadband, wireless, business services, advertising, video and other revenue, partially offset by a decline in voice revenue.\n- Adjusted EBITDA increased 11.2% to $28.1 billion primarily due to increases in revenue, partially offset by increases in programming and technical and product support expenses.\n- Operating margin increased from 42.1% to 43.7%.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Cable Communications Segment - Operating Costs and Expenses\n\n## Programming Expenses\n\nProgramming expenses, which represent our most significant operating expense, are the fees we incur to provide content to our customers. These expenses represent the programming license fees charged by content providers, including the fees related to the distribution of cable and broadcast network programming and fees charged for retransmission of the signals from local broadcast television stations.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in retransmission consent and sports programming rates, and the impacts in 2020  of  adjustment  provisions  in  our  programming  distribution  agreements  with  regional  sports  networks  related  to  canceled sporting events as a result of COVID-19. These increases were partially offset by declines in the number of video subscribers.\n\nWe expect that our programming expenses will be impacted by rate increases, although to a lesser extent in 2022 compared to 2021 due to the timing of contract renewals, which will be offset by expected declines in the number of residential video customers.\n\n## Technical and Product Support Expenses\n\nExpenses  include  costs  to  complete  service  call  and  installation  activities;  costs  for  network  operations,  product  development, fulfillment and provisioning; the cost of wireless handsets, tablets and smart watches sold to customers; and monthly wholesale wireless access fees.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increased costs associated with our wireless phone service from increases in the sale of devices and the number of customers receiving service, partially offset by lower personnel costs.\n\n## Customer Service Expenses\n\nExpenses include the personnel and other costs associated with handling the sale of services to customers and customer service activity.\n\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower labor costs as a result of reduced call volumes.\n\n## Advertising, Marketing and Promotion Expenses\n\nExpenses include the costs associated with attracting new customers and promoting our service offerings.\n\nExpenses  increased  in  2021  primarily  due  to  increased  spending  associated  with  attracting  new  customers  and  promoting  our service offerings, including advertising expenses associated with the Tokyo Olympics, as well as decreased spending as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n\n## Franchise and Other Regulatory Fees\n\nExpenses represent the fees we are required to pay to federal, state and local authorities, including fees under the terms of our cable franchise agreements.\n\nExpenses increased in 2021 primarily due to increases in regulatory costs.\n\n## Other Expenses\n\nExpenses  primarily  include  administrative  personnel  costs;  fees  paid  to  third-party  channels  for  which  Cable  represents  the advertising sales efforts; other business support costs, including building and office expenses, taxes and billing costs; and bad debt.\n\nExpenses decreased in 2021 primarily due to a decrease in bad debt expense.\n\n## Cable Communications Segment - Operating Margin\n\nOur operating margin is Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of revenue. We believe this metric is useful particularly as we continue to focus on growing our higher-margin businesses and improving overall operating cost management. Our operating margin was 43.7%, 42.1% and 40.1% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. While the accrued adjustments for regional sports networks did not impact Adjusted EBITDA, they resulted in an increase to operating margins in 2020.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the $16,420 million in 2023 subscription fees reported by the Entertainment segment relate to the subscriber-based fees incurred for programming Hulu Live, and what does this reveal about the segment's reliance on internal content licensing from the Sports segment?",
      "answer": "The $16,420 million in subscription fees reported by the Entertainment segment in 2023 includes revenue from direct-to-consumer platforms such as Disney+ and Hulu, which are closely tied to the subscriber-based fees incurred for programming Hulu Live. These subscriber-based fees include payments made to the Sports segment for the right to air ESPN and other sports content on Hulu Live. This intersegment dependency reveals that the Entertainment segment not only generates revenue from subscription models but also incurs significant internal costs to license content from the Sports segment, highlighting a structural interdependence between the two segments in delivering live programming to subscribers.",

In 2024, the Consumer Wireline segment reported an EBITDA margin of 33.4%, showing strong cash flow generation. However, the nonrecurring fair value measurement disclosures on page 72 indicate that the Consumer Wireline reporting unit was assessed for impairment using Level 3 inputs, which could signal underlying financial stress or strategic uncertainty not captured in the EBITDA margin.

EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting, and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses. There are material limitations to using these non-GAAP financial measures. EBITDA and EBITDA margin, as we have defined them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\n\n",

      "question": "How does the significant long-term programming and production commitment tied to NBCUniversal's sports rights agreements align with the reduction in NBCUniversal's guaranteed debt from $2.8 billion in 2020 to $1.6 billion in 2021?",
      "answer": "The company disclosed that approximately 40% of cash payments related to programming and production obligations, primarily from multiyear sports rights agreements held by NBCUniversal, are due after five years. Despite this long-term commitment, NBCUniversal's guaranteed debt decreased from $2.8 billion in 2020 to $1.6 billion in 2021. This suggests a strategic shift in NBCUniversal's capital structure, potentially reflecting refinancing, debt repayment, or a reallocation of financial guarantees within the company's broader debt structure, even as it maintains substantial long-term programming obligations.",

      "question": "How does the Latin America segment's $3,144 million revenue contribution in 2023 relate to the overall 0.8% growth in total segment operating revenues, particularly in light of the Communications segment\u2019s dominance and the Business Wireline segment\u2019s 7.3% revenue decline?",
      "answer": "The Latin America segment contributed $3,144 million in revenue in 2023, representing approximately 3% of total segment operating revenues. While this segment remained stable, the overall total segment operating revenues grew by only 0.8%, from $117,067 million in 2022 to $118,038 million in 2023. This modest growth was largely driven by increases in the Mobility segment (2.7% growth) and Consumer Wireline segment (3.3% growth), which offset the significant 7.3% decline in Business Wireline revenues. Given that the Communications segment accounts for about 97% of total segment operating revenues, the performance of individual components like Business Wireline had a pronounced effect on the overall growth rate, limiting it to less than 1% despite growth in other areas.",

      "answer": "The Theme Parks segment's negative Adjusted EBITDA of $477 million in 2020, as reported in the financial tables, indicates a significant drag on NBCUniversal's profitability during the pandemic. Hop3 evidence shows that the segment continued to face capacity restrictions and uncertainty through 2021, which likely delayed recovery into 2022. Given that NBCUniversal as a whole contributed $5.355 billion to CMCSA's total Adjusted EBITDA of $30.8 billion in 2022, the underperformance of the Theme Parks division likely constrained the overall EBITDA margin growth. Furthermore, with $1.6 billion in debt obligations tied to NBCUniversal (Hop1), the segment's weak performance may have increased leverage risk and pressured EBITDA margin sustainability.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "Given the Latin America segment's significant decline in asset balance from $15,811 million in 2020 to $8,874 million in 2021, how does AT&T's capital expenditure allocation of $580 million for the Latin America segment in 2021 reflect their strategic approach to this region?",
      "answer": "The capital expenditure allocation of $580 million to the Latin America segment in 2021 appears relatively modest compared to the segment's overall asset decline of $6,937 million (from $15,811 million in 2020 to $8,874 million in 2021). This suggests a strategic approach focused on limited reinvestment rather than aggressive growth in the region during this period. The significant reduction in asset balance, far exceeding the capital expenditures, indicates potential actions such as divestitures, impairments, or portfolio rationalization, as noted in the context of the asset balances. Therefore, the capital allocation likely reflects a strategic decision to scale back operations or reposition the segment rather than expand it.",

      "question": "How does the 3% revenue growth attributed to the Entertainment segment align with the specific distribution cost reductions mentioned in the operating results, particularly given the decreases in theatrical and TV/VOD distribution costs?",
      "answer": "The Entertainment segment contributed to a 3% overall revenue increase for Disney in fiscal 2024, driven by subscription revenue, parks, and advertising. Despite this growth, the company reported lower distribution costs due to decreases in theatrical, home entertainment, and TV/VOD distribution costs. Specifically, these reductions were partially offset by increases at Lucasfilm's special effects business. The alignment between revenue growth and cost reduction suggests a potential improvement in operating leverage, as the segment grew revenue while reducing certain distribution expenses. This dynamic indicates possible cost optimization in key distribution channels\u2014such as theatrical and TV/VOD\u2014that directly impact the segment's profitability.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "answer": "AT&T evaluates the fair value of the Consumer Wireline reporting unit using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches due to potential impairment indicators, as disclosed on page 72. Meanwhile, page 38 reveals that Consumer Wireline has demonstrated consistent improvement in operating income margins, rising from 4.9% in 2023 to 6.4% in 2024. This margin growth suggests improving financial performance, which could positively influence the fair value estimation of the segment. However, since the fair value models rely on forward-looking assumptions, the current margin improvement may not fully offset potential impairment risks if future expectations remain uncertain.",

This aligns with the reported 2024 revenue decline in the Business Wireline unit, driven by lower demand for legacy services, product simplification, and the absence of cybersecurity revenues from LevelBlue.

By reducing workforce-related costs, the restructuring could have improved operational efficiency, thereby boosting profitability. However, the 10-K does not explicitly attribute the income growth directly to the restructuring actions. Additionally, the restructuring charges were incurred in 2022 and spread across multiple segments, making it difficult to isolate the specific financial impact of these measures on the Family of Apps segment in 2024.

      "question": "How does the increase in Technical and Product Support Costs for the Cable Communications Segment, as reported in the consolidated operating costs, relate to the segment's qualitative goodwill assessment that concluded fair value substantially exceeded carrying value?",
      "answer": "The Cable Communications Segment experienced a 6.8% increase in Technical and Product Support Costs from 2020 to 2021, as shown in the consolidated operating costs and expenses table. This cost increase contributed to rising segment expenses during the same period. However, in the goodwill impairment analysis, the company performed a qualitative assessment and concluded that the estimated fair value of the Cable Communications Segment 'substantially exceeded' its carrying value as of July 1, 2021. This suggests that despite rising operational costs, other factors such as revenue growth, future cash flow projections, and market conditions supported a strong fair value assessment. The synthesis of these two perspectives indicates that the segment's financial health, as judged by market expectations and long-term profitability, was not seen as materially threatened by the rising technical and product support costs in the short term.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nComcast also provides a full and unconditional guarantee of $138 million principal amount of subordinated debt issued by Comcast Holdings. Comcast's obligations under this guarantee are subordinated and subject, in right of payment, to the prior payment in full of all of Comcast's senior indebtedness, including debt guaranteed by Comcast on a senior basis; and are structurally subordinated to  the  indebtedness  and  other  liabilities  of  its  non-guarantor  subsidiaries  (for  purposes  of  this  Comcast  Holdings  discussion, Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal are included within the non-guarantor subsidiary group). Comcast's obligations as guarantor will remain in effect until all amounts payable with respect to the guaranteed debt have been paid in full. However, the guarantee will terminate upon a disposition of Comcast Holdings or all or substantially all of its assets. Comcast Holdings is a consolidated subsidiary holding company that directly or indirectly holds 100% and approximately 37% of our equity interests in Comcast Cable and NBCUniversal, respectively.\n\nAs  of  December  31,  2021  and  2020,  Comcast  and  Comcast  Holdings,  the  combined  issuer  and  guarantor  of  the  guaranteed subordinated debt, have noncurrent senior notes payable to non-guarantor subsidiaries of $96 billion and $94 billion, respectively, and  noncurrent  notes  receivable  from  non-guarantor  subsidiaries  of  $29  billion  and  $23  billion,  respectively.  This  financial information  is  that  of  Comcast  and  Comcast  Holdings  presented  on  a  combined  basis  with  intercompany  balances  between Comcast and Comcast Holdings eliminated. The combined financial information excludes financial information of non-guarantor subsidiaries  of  Comcast  and  Comcast  Holdings.  The  underlying  net  assets  of  the  non-guarantor  subsidiaries  of  Comcast  and Comcast Holdings are significantly in excess of the obligations of Comcast and Comcast Holdings. Excluding investments in nonguarantor subsidiaries, external debt and the noncurrent notes payable and receivable with non-guarantor subsidiaries, Comcast and Comcast Holdings do not have material assets, liabilities or results of operations.\n\n## Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates\n\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and the related disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities. We base our judgments on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making estimates about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\n\nWe  believe  our  judgments  and  related  estimates  associated  with  the  valuation  and  impairment  testing  of  goodwill  and  cable franchise  rights  and  the  accounting  for  film  and  television  costs  are  critical  in  the  preparation  of  our  consolidated  financial statements. Management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting judgments and estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, and the Audit Committee has reviewed the related disclosures below. See also Notes 4 and 10.\n\n## Valuation and Impairment Testing of Goodwill and Cable Franchise Rights\n\nWe assess the recoverability of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including cable franchise rights, annually as of July 1, or more frequently whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The assessment of recoverability may first consider qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount. A quantitative assessment is performed if the qualitative assessment results in a more-likely-than-not determination or if a qualitative assessment is not performed.\n\n## Goodwill\n\nGoodwill results from business combinations and represents the excess amount of the consideration paid over the identifiable assets and liabilities recorded in the acquisition. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level and have concluded that our reporting units are generally the same as our reportable segments. We evaluate the determination of our reporting units periodically or whenever events or substantive changes in circumstances occur. When performing a quantitative assessment, we estimate the fair values  of  our  reporting  units  primarily  based  on  a  discounted  cash  flow  analysis  that  involves  significant  judgment,  including market participant estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the business and the selection of discount rates. When analyzing the fair values indicated under discounted cash flow models, we also consider multiples of Adjusted EBITDA generated by the underlying assets, current market transactions and profitability information.\n\nWe  performed  qualitative  assessments  in  2021  for  goodwill  in  our  Cable  Communications  and  NBCUniversal  segments.  The qualitative  assessments  considered  that  the  estimated  fair  values  of  these  reporting  units  substantially  exceeded  their  carrying values  at  the  time  of  our  previous  quantitative  assessments  in  2018;  changes  in  projected  future  cash  flows;  recent  market transactions and overall macroeconomic conditions, including the effects of COVID-19; discount rates; and changes in our market capitalization.  Based  on  these  assessments,  we  concluded  that  it  was  more  likely  than  not  that  the  estimated  fair  values  of  our reporting units were higher than their carrying values and that the performance of a quantitative impairment test was not",

      "question": "How did the Communications segment's 74% share of 2021 total segment operating revenues correspond with the 11.4% year-over-year decline in total segment operating contribution, particularly in light of rising direct costs and selling, general and administrative expenses?",
      "answer": "The Communications segment contributed 74% of 2021 total segment operating revenues, maintaining its position as the largest revenue generator. However, this segment also experienced significant cost pressures, including a 13.9% increase in 'Other' direct costs and an 11.9% rise in 'Selling, general and administrative' expenses. These rising costs eroded profitability and contributed to the overall 11.4% year-over-year decline in total segment operating contribution, despite the segment's dominant revenue share. This indicates that while the Communications segment remains central to AT&T\u2019s revenue base, its operational efficiency challenges directly impacted consolidated operating margins.",

The increase reflects cash distributions received by AT&amp;T in excess of the carrying amount of our investment in DIRECTV, partially offset by the performance of our investment in DIRECTV (see Notes 10 and 19).\n\nOther income (expense) - net increased in 2024. The increase was primarily driven by actuarial remeasurement of benefit plan assets and obligations, with an actuarial loss of $56 in 2024, compared to net actuarial and settlement losses of $1,594 in 2023 (see Note 14). Also contributing to the increase was the prior-year writedown of our SKY Mexico equity investment. These increases were partially offset by lower pension and postretirement benefit credits and lower returns on other benefit-related investments.\n\nIncome tax expense increased in 2024. While our income before income taxes decreased in 2024, it includes a goodwill impairment associated with our Business Wireline reporting unit, which is not deductible for tax  purposes and results in a higher effective tax  rate. Our effective tax  rate was 26.6% in 2024, 21.3% in 2023, and (122.2)% in 2022. The effective tax  rate in 2022 was also impacted by goodwill impairments, which are not deductible for tax  purposes.\n\nSegment Results Our segments are comprised of strategic business units or other operations that offer products and services to different customer segments over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We evaluate segment performance based on operating income as well as EBITDA and/or EBITDA margin. See 'Discussion and Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures' for a reconciliation of EBITDA and EBITDA margin to the most comparable financial measures calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\n\n",

      "question": "How does the 2022 restructuring charge related to Reality Labs align with the year-over-year increase in Reality Labs' costs and expenses in 2024 compared to 2023?",
      "answer": "The 2022 restructuring charge included costs related to Reality Labs (RL) as part of a broader efficiency initiative, which involved layoffs and facility consolidations. Despite these restructuring efforts aimed at cost reduction, Reality Labs' costs and expenses increased by 10% in 2024 compared to 2023, rising from $18,016 million to $19,875 million. This suggests that while restructuring was intended to streamline operations, the segment still experienced rising costs, potentially due to continued investment in long-term strategic initiatives such as AR/VR development. The persistence of cost growth in RL, even after restructuring, indicates a strategic prioritization of investment over immediate cost containment in this innovation-focused segment.",

      "question": "Given the Latin America segment's contribution to total service revenue and its EBITDA margin trends over the past three years, how does the segment's profitability relative to its revenue base align with AT&T's broader rationale for using EBITDA margin as a key performance metric?",
      "answer": "The Latin America segment contributed $2,162 million in service revenue in 2024, representing a small fraction (about 2.2%) of AT&T's total service revenue of $97,831 million. Despite its modest revenue contribution, the segment's EBITDA margin improved from 10.6% in 2022 to 16.5% in 2024, indicating improving efficiency and cash generation potential. This aligns with AT&T's rationale for using EBITDA margin as a key performance metric, as outlined in the non-GAAP reconciliation section, where it is described as a measure of a business unit's cash generation potential, excluding the impact of capital investment and debt service. However, the segment's operating income margin remained low (0.9% in 2024), suggesting that while EBITDA margin paints a more favorable picture of the segment's operational efficiency, it does not fully reflect the segment's limited profitability after depreciation and amortization. This highlights how EBITDA margin can be a useful but potentially incomplete indicator of segment performance.",

EBITDA is used as part of our management reporting, and we believe EBITDA to be a relevant and useful measurement to our investors as it measures the cash generation potential of our business units. EBITDA does not give effect to depreciation and amortization expenses incurred in operating income nor is it burdened by cash used for debt service requirements and thus does not reflect available funds for distributions, reinvestment or other discretionary uses.

Despite generating only $1,648 million in revenue\u2014significantly less than other segments like Google Services or Google Cloud\u2014Other Bets saw a $349 million increase in operating loss, largely driven by these compensation expenses.

      "answer": "Reality Labs reported a $17.73 billion loss from operations in 2024, a 10% increase from the prior year, driven by higher employee compensation and infrastructure costs. This aligns with the $19.88 billion in total investments made in RL during 2024, which were directed toward developing metaverse and wearable technologies, including VR/AR devices and foundational platforms. Despite the growing losses, the company explicitly states that RL is expected to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and its long-term viability depends on generating sufficient profits from the Family of Apps.

Business\n\n## Overview\n\nOur mission is to build the future of human connection and the technology that makes it possible.\n\nWe build technology that helps people connect and share, find and build communities, and grow businesses. Our products enable people to connect and share  with  friends  and  family  through  mobile  devices,  personal  computers,  virtual  reality  (V R)  and  mix ed  reality  (MR)  headsets,  augmented  reality  (AR),  and wearables. We also help people discover and learn about what is going on in the world around them, enable people to share their experiences, ideas, photos, videos, and other content with audiences ranging from their closest family members and friends to the public at large, and stay connected everywhere by accessing our products. Meta is moving our offerings beyond 2D screens toward immersive experiences like augmented, mixed, and virtual reality to help build the next computing platform. Our vision does not center on any single product, but rather an entire ecosystem of experiences, devices, and new technologies. While the metaverse is in the very early stages of its development, we believe it will become the next computing platform and the future of social interaction.\n\nAcross our work, we are innovating in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to build new experiences that help make our platform more social, useful, and immersive. Our AI investments support initiatives across our products and services, helping power the systems that rank content in our apps, our discovery engine that recommends relevant content, the tools advertisers use to reach customers, the development of new generative AI experiences, and the tools that make our product development more efficient and productive. For example, Meta AI is an assistant that's available across our apps, on Ray-Ban Meta AI glasses and on the web. It's designed to help people learn, get things done, create content, and connect with others to make the most of every moment.\n\nWe report financial results for two segments: Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL). Currently, we generate substantially all of our revenue from selling advertising placements on our family of apps to marketers, which is reflected in FoA. Ads on our platform enable marketers to reach people across a range of marketing objectives, such as generating leads or driving awareness. Marketers purchase ads that can appear in multiple places including on Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party applications and websites. RL generates revenue from sales of consumer hardware products, software, and content.\n\nWe invest in our business based on our company priorities. In 2025, we intend to focus on several key investment areas: generative AI, our discovery engine, the metaverse and wearables, Threads, monetization of our products and services, platform integrity and community support, and infrastructure capacity.\n\nThe majority of our investments are directed toward developing our family of apps. In 2024, 79% of our total costs and expenses were recognized in FoA and 21% were recognized in RL. Our FoA investments were $75.25 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount, data centers and technical infrastructure as part of our efforts to develop our apps and our advertising services. We are also making significant investments in our metaverse and wearables efforts. This includes developing virtual, mixed, and augmented reality devices, software for social platforms, neural interfaces, and other foundational technologies. Our total RL investments were $19.88 billion in 2024 and include expenses relating to headcount and technology development across these efforts. These are fundamentally new technologies that we expect will evolve as the next computing platform develops, and many products may only be fully realized in the next decade. Although it is inherently difficult to predict when and how the next computing platform will develop, we expect our RL segment to continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future, and our ability to support our efforts to build the nex t computing platform is dependent on generating sufficient profits from other areas of our business. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term initiative. We are investing now because we believe this is the next chapter of the internet and will unlock monetization opportunities for businesses, developers, and creators, including around advertising, hardware, and digital goods.",

      "answer": "The decline in T's Total Segment Operating Contribution from $8,210 million in 2020 to $7,277 million in 2021 represents a 11.4% decrease, which is partially attributed to the WarnerMedia segment's contribution of 21% in 2021. This is a drop from its 23% contribution in 2020, suggesting a relative decline in the segment's profitability. Concurrently, the WarnerMedia segment's asset base also decreased from $42,447 million in 2020 to $40,507 million in 2021, indicating a reduction in the segment's scale or investment. This suggests that the WarnerMedia segment not only contributed less to the overall operating performance in 2021 but also operated with a smaller asset base, potentially reflecting strategic decisions or market conditions affecting its operations.",

      "answer": "The consolidated financial statement on page 88 shows that total costs and expenses increased by 8% year-over-year, from $88,151 million in 2023 to $95,121 million in 2024. This aligns with the segment-level data on page 61, which breaks down the cost growth into the Family of Apps (7% increase, from $70,135 million to $75,246 million) and Reality Labs (10% increase, from $18,016 million to $19,875 million). The consolidated increase of 8% reflects a weighted average of these segment-level cost increases. This reveals that while Meta's core business (Family of Apps) is growing its cost base at a slower rate, the emerging Reality Labs segment is growing faster, suggesting continued investment in long-term initiatives like the metaverse. The alignment between the consolidated and segment-level figures confirms the consistency of Meta's financial reporting and highlights the dual focus on sustaining current operations while funding future growth.",

      "question": "How does the impact of tax incentives on content amortization in 2024, which reduced amortization by $899 million, reconcile with the complexity and subjectivity described in the audit process for estimating viewing patterns that underpin content amortization?",
      "answer": "The 2024 tax incentives reduced content amortization by $899 million by lowering the cost basis of content assets, which directly affects the amortization expense over time. However, the audit process for content amortization, as described, relies heavily on subjective estimates of future viewing patterns based on historical and forecasted data. This creates a dual dependency: while tax incentives quantifiably reduce amortization, the ultimate timing and amount of expense recognition still hinge on the accuracy of viewing pattern estimates, which are inherently uncertain and subject to change. Thus, despite the clear dollar benefit from tax incentives, the amortization remains sensitive to forecasting errors in viewer behavior, which the audit procedures aim to mitigate through sensitivity analyses and data validation.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

These initiatives, which included a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees and a facilities consolidation strategy, were aimed at reducing costs and improving efficiency. By 2024, these restructuring efforts had been completed, and the significant margin expansion\u2014from 47% to 54%\u2014suggests that the cost-cutting measures contributed positively to profitability.

      "question": "How does Disney's reliance on affiliate fees from Linear Networks, as a core revenue source, align with the significant programming and production costs reported in the same segment, and what implications does this have for the sustainability of their traditional TV business model?",
      "answer": "Disney's Linear Networks segment relies heavily on affiliate fees as a core revenue source, with these fees being a primary component of the segment\u2019s income. However, the same segment also incurs substantial programming and production costs, which include amortization of licensed programming rights, capitalized production costs, and fees for live programming such as news and sports. These costs are largely allocated across content creation groups like Studios, General Entertainment, Sports, and International. Additionally, the Linear Networks segment is responsible for sub-licensing sports programming, which contributes to both revenue and cost structures. Given that these costs are significant and rising due to ongoing investments in content production and licensing, the sustainability of the traditional Linear Networks business model\u2014relying on affiliate fees and advertising\u2014faces pressure. The high cost base tied to content creation and rights acquisition, as detailed in both the revenue and expense sections of the DMED segment, suggests that maintaining profitability in Linear Networks may depend on continued strong performance in affiliate fee negotiations and advertising sales, despite rising input costs.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

These fees include consumer subscription-based products like YouTube TV, Google One, and other premium services. Meanwhile, Google Cloud, which generates revenues primarily from enterprise subscriptions and cloud infrastructure services, also experienced strong growth, increasing from $33.088 billion in 2023 to $43.229 billion in 2024. However, both segments are subject to tax uncertainties, with the company reporting $12.6 billion in gross unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2024, of which $10.0 billion would directly impact the effective tax rate. This raises concerns about how the rapid growth in subscription-based revenues across both consumer and enterprise segments may be exposed to tax adjustments, especially in foreign jurisdictions where transfer pricing and permanent establishment claims are being contested.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: GOOGL(page_88) \u2192 Subscription Fees: Subscription fees are a major component of Google Services' revenue, including consumer-based subscriptions like YouTube TV, Google One, and NFL Sunday Ticket.",
        "Hop 2: Subscription Fees \u2192 Google Cloud: Google Cloud also generates revenue from subscription-based models, but these are primarily enterprise-focused, including Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform services.",

The Business Wireline segment reported $14,934 million in operations and support expenses, a significant portion of its $22,538 million in revenue, highlighting its cost-intensive nature (T_10k_2024.pdf:page_56). When compared to the overall corporate operations and support expenses of $30,845 million, Business Wireline accounts for nearly 48% of corporate cost structure, suggesting it plays a major role in AT&T\u2019s cost management considerations despite generating only 18.7% of total corporate revenue.

      "question": "Given Google Cloud's 30.7% revenue growth from 2023 to 2024, how might the increasing reliance on subscription fees\u2014subject to international tax scrutiny\u2014impact the company's unrecognized tax benefits, which rose from $9.4 billion in 2023 to $12.6 billion in 2024?",
      "answer": "Google Cloud's revenue increased from $33.088 billion in 2023 to $43.229 billion in 2024, representing a 30.7% growth (page 37). A significant portion of this revenue comes from subscription-based services, such as Google Workspace and Google Cloud Platform, which are highlighted in the segment description (page 88). These subscription fees are increasingly subject to international tax scrutiny, particularly in foreign jurisdictions asserting transfer pricing adjustments or permanent establishment claims (page 88). This aligns with the rise in unrecognized tax benefits from $9.4 billion in 2023 to $12.6 billion in 2024, suggesting that as Google Cloud expands globally, the complexity and exposure of its tax positions\u2014especially in non-U.S. jurisdictions\u2014are growing. Therefore, the rapid growth in subscription-based revenue from Google Cloud appears to be contributing to increased tax risk and uncertainty, as reflected in the rising unrecognized tax benefits.",

Significant judgment is required in ev aluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our prov ision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.1 billion, $9.4 billion, and $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectiv ely, of which $5.3 billion, $7.4 billion, and $10.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effectiv e tax rate, respectiv ely.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we accrued $622 million and $1.1 billion in interest and penalties in prov ision for income taxes, respectiv ely.\n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining  our  2016  through  2021  tax  returns.  We  hav e  also  receiv ed  tax  assessments  in  multiple  foreign  jurisdictions  asserting  transfer  pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\n\nThe tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate gov ernmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in v arious other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adv erse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our prov ision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in v arious taxing jurisdictions.\n\nWe believe that an adequate prov ision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. Howev er, the outcome of tax audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are  resolv ed  in  a  manner  not  consistent  with  management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our prov ision for  income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believ e it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.\n\n## Note 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\n\nWe report our segment results as Google Serv ices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\n- Google Services includes products and serv ices such as ads, Android, Chrome, dev ices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates rev enues primarily from adv ertising; fees receiv ed for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and dev ices.\n- Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform serv ices, applications, and other serv ices for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates rev enues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  receiv ed  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  serv ices,  Google  Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise serv ices.\n- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not indiv idually material.

Significant judgment is required in ev aluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our prov ision for income taxes. The total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits was $7.1 billion, $9.4 billion, and $12.6 billion as of December 31, 2022, 2023, and 2024, respectiv ely, of which $5.3 billion, $7.4 billion, and $10.0 billion, if recognized, would affect our effectiv e tax rate, respectiv ely.\n\nAs of December 31, 2023 and 2024, we accrued $622 million and $1.1 billion in interest and penalties in prov ision for income taxes, respectiv ely.\n\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. Our two major tax jurisdictions are the U.S. federal and Ireland. We are subject to the continuous examination of our income tax returns by the IRS and other tax authorities. The IRS is currently examining  our  2016  through  2021  tax  returns.  We  hav e  also  receiv ed  tax  assessments  in  multiple  foreign  jurisdictions  asserting  transfer  pricing adjustments or permanent establishment. We continue to defend such claims as presented.\n\nThe tax years 2016 through 2023 remain subject to examination by the appropriate gov ernmental agencies for Irish tax purposes. There are other ongoing audits in v arious other jurisdictions that are not material to our financial statements.\n\nWe regularly assess the likelihood of adv erse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our prov ision for income taxes. We continue to monitor the progress of ongoing discussions with tax authorities and the effect, if any, of the expected expiration of the statute of limitations in v arious taxing jurisdictions.\n\nWe believe that an adequate prov ision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. Howev er, the outcome of tax audits  cannot  be  predicted  with  certainty.  If  any  issues  addressed  in  our  tax  audits  are  resolv ed  in  a  manner  not  consistent  with  management's expectations, we could be required to adjust our prov ision for  income taxes in the period such resolutions occur. Although the timing of resolution, settlement, and closure of audits is not certain, we do not believ e it is reasonably possible that our unrecognized tax benefits from certain U.S. federal, state, and non U.S. tax positions will materially change in the next 12 months.\n\n## Note 15. Information about Segments and Geographic Areas\n\nWe report our segment results as Google Serv ices, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:\n\n- Google Services includes products and serv ices such as ads, Android, Chrome, dev ices, Google Maps, Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates rev enues primarily from adv ertising; fees receiv ed for consumer subscription-based products such as YouTube TV, YouTube Music and Premium, and NFL Sunday Ticket, as well as Google One; the sale of apps and in-app purchases; and dev ices.\n- Google Cloud includes infrastructure and platform serv ices, applications, and other serv ices for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates rev enues  primarily  from  consumption-based  fees  and  subscriptions  receiv ed  for  Google  Cloud  Platform  serv ices,  Google  Workspace communication and collaboration tools, and other enterprise serv ices.\n- Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not indiv idually material.

      "answer": "AT&T's Consumer Wireline segment, which had an Operating Income of $634 million as shown in the segment performance table, is subject to nonrecurring fair value measurements due to impairment indicators, suggesting potential write-downs or long-term value erosion. This is particularly significant given the broader context that AT&T reported an overall Operating Loss of $88 million in 2024, a sharp decline from a $1,289 million Operating Income in 2023. The fair value analysis of Consumer Wireline\u2014conducted using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches\u2014likely reflects this deteriorating financial performance and may signal strategic or operational challenges specific to the segment that are contributing to the company's negative operating performance.",

      "question": "How does the increase in Theme Parks segment costs and expenses in 2023 relate to the seasonal revenue patterns described for the same segment, and what does this imply about the scalability of the Theme Parks business during peak attendance periods?",
      "answer": "The Theme Parks segment costs and expenses increased in 2023 due to higher costs associated with increased guest attendance. This aligns with the seasonal revenue patterns described, where the segment experiences peak attendance during the spring holiday period, summer months, and winter holiday season. The fact that rising attendance leads to higher costs suggests that the Theme Parks business may face scalability challenges during peak periods, as increased demand necessitates greater operational spending on labor, maintenance, and in-park services. This implies that while higher attendance can drive revenue growth, it may also compress margins unless cost management strategies are effectively implemented.",

        "Hop 1: CMCSA(page_52) \u2192 Costs and Expenses: The table shows that total costs and expenses increased from $46,275 million in 2022 to $47,506 million in 2023, with specific increases noted in the Theme Parks segment.",

      "question": "Given Business Wireline's declining operating contribution, how does AT&T's continued revenue dependence on this segment align with its strategy of reducing communications segment assets?",
      "answer": "Business Wireline reported a 12.6% decline in operating contribution in 2021 compared to 2020 (from page 39), indicating deteriorating profitability. Despite this, it remained a significant revenue contributor with $25,116 million in service revenue in 2021 (from page 89), representing a substantial portion of the Communications segment's total $25,901 million revenue. Meanwhile, the Communications segment's asset balance declined from $91,976 million at the start of 2021 to $91,900 million by year-end (from page 99), showing a deliberate reduction in asset base. This suggests AT&T is strategically managing a shrinking but still critical revenue stream while aligning its asset base with evolving business needs.",

      "answer": "Disney faces competitive pressures that constrain its ability to raise subscription fees (page 23), while the Sports segment relies heavily on licensed sports rights, which constitute a major component of its programming and production costs (page 38). The company notes that the cost of obtaining programming rights, particularly for sports, has increased and may continue to rise at faster rates than historical trends. At the same time, competition limits pricing power over subscription fees, which are a key revenue source for the Sports segment. This dynamic creates pressure on segment margins, especially since the renewal of long-term contracts for these sports rights is uncertain and may result in less favorable terms. If Disney cannot renew these contracts on economically viable terms, or if it must pay higher costs while being unable to pass those increases to consumers, the Sports segment\u2019s profitability could be materially affected.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## Increased competitive pressures impact our revenues, increase our costs and impact the profitability of our businesses.\n\nWe face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. This includes, among other types, competition for human resources, content and other resources we require in operating our business. For example:\n\n- Our programming and production operations compete to obtain creative, performing, production and business talent, sports and other programming, story properties, advertiser support, production facilities and market share with traditional and new media platforms, including other video-on-demand services and sources of broadband delivered content, studio operators and television networks.\n- Our television networks and stations and DTC offerings compete for the sale of advertising time with traditional and new media platforms, including other television and video-on-demand services and various forms of internet and mobile delivered content, which offer advertising delivery technologies that are more targeted than can be achieved through traditional means, as well as with newspapers, magazines, billboards and radio stations.\n- Our television networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.\n- Our theme parks and resorts and experiences compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities and compete for technology, creative, performing and business talent, including with other theme park and resort operators.\n- Our content sales/licensing operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.\n- Our consumer products business competes with other licensors and creators of IP.\n- Our DTC streaming services compete for customers with an increasing number of competitors' DTC offerings, all other forms of media and all other forms of entertainment, as well as for technology, creative, performing and business talent and for content.\n\nTechnological developments, including developments in generative AI tools that can be used to create competing low-cost content, and changes in market structure, including consolidation of suppliers of resources and distribution channels, increase competition in these areas. Increased competition raises the cost of programming, including for sports and other products, and diverts consumers from our products and services or to other products and services or other forms of entertainment and experiences. In addition, given the nature of travel planning, consumers typically delay their consumption of certain of our products and services, such as our theme parks and resorts, in connection with planned major product launches of regional travel industry competitors. Each of these competitive pressures could reduce our revenue and increase our marketing costs.\n\nCompetition for the acquisition of resources can further increase the cost of producing our products and services; change the composition of our offerings, including sports; deprive us of talent needed for our entertainment and experiences businesses, including the talent necessary to produce high quality creative material; increase employee turnover and staffing instability; or increase our labor costs. Competition also reduces, or limits growth in, prices for our products and services, including advertising rates and subscription fees at our linear networks and DTC offerings, parks and resorts admissions and room rates and prices for consumer products from which we derive license revenues.\n\n## We face risks related to the renewal of long-term programming or distribution contracts on sufficiently favorable terms.\n\nWe enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to content distributors. As these contracts expire, we renew or renegotiate the contracts, which from time to time has led to service blackouts when distribution contracts expired before renewal terms were agreed. We may lose programming rights or distribution rights if we are unable to renew these contracts on acceptable terms. As a result, our portfolio of acquired programming rights, such as sporting events, and the distributors of our programming and the portfolio of programming rights our distributors acquire have changed and will continue to change over time. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining certain programming rights has increased and may continue to increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical ex perience) and programming distributors, facing pressures resulting from increased subscription fees and alternative distribution channels, demand terms (including with respect to the pricing for, and the nature and amount of, programming distributed) that reduce our revenue from distribution of programs or increase revenue at slower rates than our historical ex perience. For ex ample, the terms of recent renewals of carriage agreements have included fewer of our linear networks or the opportunity to offer multiple genre-specific bundle options of fewer than all our linear networks while providing for certain of our DTC streaming services to be made available to the distributor's subscribers. Moreover, our ability to renew these contracts on favorable terms is affected by a number of factors, such as consolidation in the market for program distribution and the entrance of new participants in the market for distribution of content on digital platforms. With respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, subscription levels and programming rights costs increases, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences.

      "answer": "Disney's strategic investment in its Experiences segment, which includes theme parks, resorts, and licensing activities, is highlighted as a key growth initiative in the context of broader economic pressures, including labor cost inflation and foreign currency volatility. The Experiences segment is directly responsible for generating revenue from royalties tied to international operations, such as those from Tokyo Disney Resort. The company reported a specific increase in parks licensing and other revenue, citing higher royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort as a contributing factor. This growth in royalties aligns with Disney's decision to increase investment in the Experiences segment, despite the risk that a strong U.S. dollar typically reduces the U.S. dollar value of international revenue. The positive royalty growth suggests that the investment is yielding returns even in the face of foreign exchange headwinds, which had previously been identified as a key risk factor.",

While a number of different factors affect the demand for our products and services, actual or perceived economic conditions could contribute to lower attendance or spending at our parks and experiences businesses, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products and linear platforms, subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC platforms or licensing fees, while also continuing to increase the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Even if inflationary pressures moderate, we expect certain costs, such as for labor, to remain elevated. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and ex periences we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs, including borrowing costs as a result of elevated interest rates, making it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations and investments on favorable terms. A decline in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated could impact implementation or success of our business plans, such as our plans to increase investment in our Experiences segment, the realignment of our cost structure and plans for our DTC ad-supported services, enhancements, pricing structure and price increases. Unfavorable economic conditions also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. The adverse impact on our businesses of actual or perceived declines in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated will depend, in part, on their severity and duration and our ability to mitigate these impacts on our businesses is limited.\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses.\n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses, including by impacting the cost in U.S. dollars of providing our goods and services, our revenues in U.S. dollars generated by our international businesses and the international demand for our domestic products and services. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar adversely impacts the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and contributes to reduced international demand for our domestic products and services, including international travel to our domestic parks and resorts. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar often increases the cost of labor, goods and services in, or originating from, non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in certain countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries.\n\n## Changes in technology, in consumer consumption patterns and in how entertainment products are created affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products and the cost of producing or distributing these products.\n\nThe media entertainment and technology businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to new technologies including shifting patterns of content consumption and how entertainment products are generated. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. These developments have impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast and cable television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels. These developments have decreased advertising and affiliate revenue at some of our linear networks and have led, and may lead in the future, to the impairment of the value of certain of our assets. In addition, theater-going to watch movies has remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRules governing new technological developments, such as developments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI and large language model tools, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue streams for the use of our IP, how we create our entertainment products and the competition we face. In order to respond to the impact of new technologies on our businesses, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement new initiatives and changes to our business models, including by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, reorganizing our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies and developing new media offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, new media offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to technological changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution impacts the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. As part of our DTC strategy, we forgo certain revenue from certain traditional sources as we invest in our DTC offerings. Since launch, our DTC streaming services experienced significant losses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will each be or remain profitable or be as profitable over the long term as our historic business models.",

Lower retail revenue was due to a decrease in online sales. Growth in licensing revenue was due to higher royalties from merchandise sales, partially offset by lower minimum guarantee shortfall recognition.\n\n## Revenues - Parks licensing and other\n\nThe increase in parks licensing and other revenue was attributable to higher sponsorship revenues, a favorable Foreign Exchange Impact and higher royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

      "question": "With Google Services revenue growing by $32.4 billion year-over-year, what proportion of this growth is being offset by increasing third-party services fees across both direct and allocated cost structures?",
      "answer": "Google Services revenue grew from $272.5 billion in 2023 to $304.9 billion in 2024, an increase of $32.4 billion. As disclosed in the operating expense breakdown, third-party services fees are a significant component of both direct and allocated costs across R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Additionally, the segment-specific cost breakdown indicates that Google Services' other costs and expenses include content and traffic acquisition costs, device costs, and third-party services fees related to advertising, technical infrastructure, and office facilities. While the 10-K does not provide an exact dollar amount for third-party services fees alone, the presence of these fees across multiple cost categories suggests that a meaningful portion of the $32.4 billion revenue growth is being absorbed by these escalating indirect costs, potentially constraining operating margin expansion.",

      "answer": "Disney plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs in fiscal 2023, with the majority intended for both Linear Networks and DTC platforms. The Direct-to-Consumer segment pays fees to Linear Networks for the right to air linear network feeds and other services, indicating a financial dependency. However, the company also highlights in its risk factors that pandemic-related disruptions to content production could have a disproportionate impact on the DTC segment, which relies heavily on consistent programming output to maintain subscriber growth and engagement. This creates a tension between strategic content distribution plans and operational risks\u2014while DTC depends on Linear Networks for programming rights and original content, any production delays or suspensions could hinder DTC's ability to meet its financial targets, especially given its higher cost sensitivity and subscriber-based revenue model.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\nIn fiscal 2023, the Studios plan to produce approximately 40 titles, which include films and episodic television programs, for distribution theatrically and/or on our DTC platforms.\n\n## General Entertainment\n\nContent produced by General Entertainment primarily consists of original episodic television programs, network news and daytime/nighttime content. General Entertainment also acquires episodic television programming rights. Original content is generally produced by the following Company owned television studios: ABC Signature; 20th Television; Disney Branded Television; FX Productions; and National Geographic Studios. Original content is also commissioned by General Entertainment and produced by various other third-party studios. Costs to produce original content are generally capitalized and allocated to the distribution platform utilizing the content. Program development is carried out in collaboration with writers, producers and creative teams.\n\nGeneral Entertainments television programming library includes content from approximately 70 years of production history. Series with four or more seasons include approximately 75 one-hour dramas, 55 half-hour comedies, 5 half-hour non-scripted series, 30 one-hour non-scripted series, 15 half-hour animated series and 10 half-hour live-action series. The library includes approximately 130 series that the General Entertainment group produced for initial distribution on our DTC platforms.\n\nIn fiscal 2023, General Entertainment plans to produce or commission more than 270 original programs, most of which will include multiple episodes. Productions generally include comedies, dramas, animations, documentaries, specials, made for TV movies, shorts and network news content. The vast majority of programming will be used on our Linear Networks and/or our DTC platforms. Programming is also produced for third-parties, many of which have domestic linear distribution rights, while the Company has SVOD and international distribution rights.\n\n## Sports\n\nThe Company has various professional and college sports programming rights, which the Sports group uses to produce content aired on our Linear Networks and distributed on our DTC platforms, including live events, sports news and original content. In the U.S., rights include college football (including bowl games and the College Football Playoff) and basketball, the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), MLB, US Open Tennis, the Professional Golfers' Association (PGA) Championship, the Women's National Basketball Association (WNBA), soccer, Top Rank Boxing, the Wimbledon Championships, the Masters golf tournament, mixed martial arts and the National Hockey League (NHL). Internationally, rights include various cricket events (for which the Company has the global distribution rights to certain events) and soccer (including English Premier League, LaLiga, Bundesliga and multiple UEFA leagues).\n\n## International\n\nThe International group focuses on the development and production of locally created and relevant entertainment and sports content to support growth across the Company's portfolio of streaming services. In addition, this group also oversees international media operations, including international linear channels, local advertising sales and local content sales and distribution. International has produced approximately 150 movies and series for initial distribution on the DTC platforms worldwide.\n\n## Competition and Seasonality\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks and DTC streaming services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations and other media, such as other DTC streaming services and video games. With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television and radio stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nThe Company's Linear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. A significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and television content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television and SVOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nThe Company's websites and digital products compete with other websites and entertainment products.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

However, within the Latin America Segment, depreciation and amortization expenses actually decreased by 9.3% over the same period, dropping from $724 million to $657 million.

      "answer": "AT&T's Mobility business unit, described as a core component of the Communications segment on page 57, generated $83,982 million in segment operating revenues in 2023, reflecting a 2.7% increase from $81,780 million in 2022. In contrast, the total Communications segment operating revenues grew by only 0.8% year-over-year, rising from $117,067 million to $118,038 million. This disparity indicates that while Mobility performed relatively well, other parts of the Communications segment\u2014particularly Business Wireline, which declined by 7.3%\u2014offset much of Mobility\u2019s growth. Thus, despite Mobility's positive contribution, the overall segment growth was muted, highlighting internal performance imbalances and potential structural challenges within the broader Communications division.",

      "question": "How does the Sports segment's revenue generation from sub-licensing of sports rights in fiscal year 2024 reconcile with its characterization as part of 'Other revenue' in Disney's strategic overview of the Sports segment?",
      "answer": "The Sports segment's revenue generation from sub-licensing of sports rights in fiscal year 2024 is explicitly listed in the segment's financial breakdown on page 38, where it is identified as one of the primary revenue sources alongside affiliate fees, advertising, and subscription fees. However, in the strategic overview of the Sports segment on page 9, sub-licensing of sports rights is grouped under the broader category of 'Other revenue,' which also includes fees from pay-per-view events on ESPN+, programming ESPN on ABC, and licensing the ESPN brand. This categorization suggests that while sub-licensing contributes to the segment's revenue, it is not a dominant or standalone revenue stream in the broader strategic positioning of the Sports segment. The specific mention of ESPN+ sub-licensing activities further contextualizes the role of this revenue source within the evolving digital distribution strategy of the Sports segment in 2024.",

With respect to the sale of advertising time, we compete with other television networks, independent television stations, MVPDs, other DTC streaming services and other advertising media such as digital content, newspapers, magazines, radio and billboards. Our television stations primarily compete for audiences and advertisers in local market areas.\n\nLinear Networks compete with other networks for carriage by MVPDs. The Company's contractual agreements with MVPDs are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. Consolidation and other market conditions in the cable, satellite and telecommunication distribution industry, including subscriber levels, and other factors may adversely affect the Company's ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms for the distribution of its various programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.\n\nContent Sales/Licensing businesses compete with all forms of entertainment and a significant number of companies that produce and/or distribute film and episodic content, distribute products in the home entertainment market, provide pay TV/VOD services, and produce music and live theater.\n\nThe operating results of Content Sales/Licensing fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the theatrical, home entertainment and television markets. Release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.\n\nWe also compete with other media and entertainment companies, independent production companies and video-on-demand services for creative and performing talent, story properties, show concepts, scripted and other programming, advertiser support, production facilities and exhibition outlets that are essential to the success of our Entertainment businesses.\n\nAdvertising revenues at Linear Networks and Direct-to-Consumer are subject to seasonal advertising patterns and changes in viewership levels. In general, domestic advertising revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. Affiliate revenues vary with the subscriber levels of MVPDs.\n\n## SPORTS\n\nThe Sports segment generally encompasses the Company's sports-focused global television and DTC video streaming content production and distribution activities.\n\nThe lines of business within Sports include the following:\n\n- ESPN (generally owned 80% by the Company)\n- Domestic:\n- Seven ESPN-branded television channels\n- ESPN on ABC (sports programmed on the ABC Network by ESPN)\n- ESPN+ DTC service\n- International: ESPN-branded channels outside of the U.S.\n- Star: Star-branded sports channels in India\n\nIn February 2024, the Company, Fox Corporation and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. announced plans to create a joint venture to offer a sports-focused DTC platform (Venu Sports) that will distribute each party's domestic sports networks, certain broadcast networks and sports streaming services. In August 2024, a motion for preliminary injunction in a matter before the District Court for the Southern District of New York was granted, enjoining the launch of Venu Sports. See Note 14 of the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding this legal matter. Further, the formation and launch of Venu Sports are subject to the finalization of definitive agreements among the parties.\n\nIn early fall 2025, the Company plans to launch a new DTC offering, which will include live linear streams of the domestic ESPN-branded television channels and ESPN+.\n\nThe significant revenues of Sports are as follows:\n\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising\n- Subscription fees\n- Other revenue - Fees from the following activities: pay-per-view events on ESPN+, sub-licensing of sports rights, programming ESPN on ABC and licensing the ESPN brand",

      "answer": "The Corporate and Other segment's balance decreased from $2 million in 2020 to $0 million in 2021, despite only $5 million in cash paid for intangible assets in 2021. This change is primarily explained by the 'Segment change' row in the balance table, which shows a $2 million reduction attributed to transfers or reclassifications. Since capital expenditures ($204 million) and cash paid for intangible assets ($5 million) are relatively small compared to the overall balance, the change is likely due to non-cash adjustments or reclassifications rather than significant investment activity.",

      "answer": "The underfunded status of Disney's Postretirement Medical Plans decreased from $1,232 million in 2021 to $790 million in 2022, indicating an improvement in the funding position. This improvement aligns with the $883 million Prepaid (Accrued) Pension Cost listed for the Postretirement Medical Plans in the balance sheet disclosures, which reflects a net prepaid amount rather than an accrued liability. The decrease in underfunded status and the positive prepaid cost suggest that Disney has made contributions or experienced favorable actuarial gains that have reduced the net liability associated with these plans.",

With a notable 11% increase in operating labor costs year-over-year, this trend could place upward pressure on the segment's overall cost structure.

This aligns with the 93.2% year-over-year increase in postpaid net additions (from 311,000 in 2023 to 601,000 in 2024), suggesting that the company's investments in network expansion\u2014such as the acquisition of spectrum licenses from UScellular and the deployment of 5G and fiber infrastructure\u2014are translating into customer acquisition success. The strong growth in postpaid subscribers, which are typically higher-value and lower-churn compared to prepaid or reseller subscribers, supports AT&T\u2019s strategic positioning in the wireless market.",

Additionally, in November 2024, we agreed to purchase select spectrum licenses from United States Cellular Corporation (UScellular) for approximately $1,000, subject to closing conditions, including the consummation of UScellular's proposed sale of its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nIn North America, our network covers over 440 million people with 4G LTE and over 314 million with 5G technology. In the United States, our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 336 million people with our LTE technology and more than 314 million people with our 5G technology.\n\nBroadband Technology In 2020, we identified fiber as a core priority for our business and enhanced our focus to ex pand our fiber footprint and grow customers. At December 31, 2024, we had more than 9.3 million fiber consumer wireline broadband customers, adding 1.0 million during the year. The expansion builds on our recent investments to convert to a software-based network, managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network supports next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services quickly and efficiently. At December 31, 2024, we had 15.3 million broadband connections, compared to 15.1 million broadband connections in the prior year.\n\nCopper Decommissioning While building the network of the future, we are actively working to exit our legacy copper network operations across the large majority of our wireline footprint. Our ex it strategy includes migrating customers to fiber and wireless alternatives, and working with policy-makers to decommission our inefficient and less reliable copper network. At December 31, 2024, we had 3.3 million network access lines in service and 127,000 DSL subscribers compared, to 4.2 million network access lines in service and 210,000 DSL subscribers in the prior year.\n\n## BUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\n## OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nOur segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.\n\nAdditional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading 'Segment Results' in Item 7 and in Note 4 of Item 8.\n\n## COMMUNICATIONS\n\nOur Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T Business, Cricket, AT&amp;T PREPAID , AT&amp;T Fiber and AT&amp;T Internet Air brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 97% of 2024 segment operating revenues and accounted for substantially all of our 2024 total segment operating income. This segment contains the Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units. SM\n\nMobility Our Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless service to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid or reseller. As of December 31, 2024, we served 118 million Mobility subscribers, including 89 million postpaid (73 million phone), 19 million prepaid and 10 million through resellers. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Through FirstNet services, we also provide a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety. \u00ae\n\nConsumers continue to require increasing availability of data-centric services and a network to connect and control those devices. An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer unlimited plans that include features allowing for the sharing of voice, tex t and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and helps minimize subscriber churn. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services.\n\nWe also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&amp;T PREPAID brands and are typically monthly prepaid services.",

However, the Business segment, while expected to face secular pressures in legacy services, still contributes to overall wireless and Fios revenue expansion. The consolidated operating revenue increase in 2024 was partially offset by a decline in the Business segment, which introduces a potential constraint on funding the capital program. This creates a tension between strategic investment in 5G and FWA expansion and the current downward trend in Business segment revenue, suggesting that the success of the capital program hinges on the Consumer segment's ability to overcompensate and on the Business segment stabilizing or reversing its revenue decline.",

Our efforts to maintain and grow our customer base and make improvements to our prepaid business, if successful, are also expected to benefit our wireless service revenue. We expect Fios revenue to benefit from growth in our Fios customer base and an ongoing demand for higher speed internet connections, which offsets the impact of the shift from bundled wireline services to standalone internet service.\n\nIn our Business segment, we expect wireless service revenue to expand, driven by growth from an increase in wireless volumes and strong FWA  revenue. We expect that Fios, through increased penetration, will also contribute to revenue growth and that legacy traditional wireline services will continue to face secular pressures.\n\n## Other Trends\n\nWe are focused on achieving profitable growth as we continue to deliver strong revenues and undertake initiatives to reduce costs and improve efficiencies, including through A I-driven technologies.\n\nWe expect that our ability to generate cash flows will benefit from our expected service revenue growth, despite the moderate expected increase in our 2025 capital program compared to 2024. See \"Liquidity and Capital Resources\" for additional information on our capital program.\n\nIn the course of business, we make promotional equipment offers to attract and retain customers. In 2024, the growth of our wireless service revenue was unfavorably impacted by the amortization of wireless equipment sales and promotions. We expect these pressures to continue and increase in 2025. In addition, in 2023 and 2024, we had fewer phone upgrades compared to prior years. T o the extent upgrade volumes increase in 2025, the expenses associated with those device sales are expected to contribute to higher costs.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nWe use the net cash generated from our operations to invest in new businesses and spectrum, fund expansion and modernization of our networks, pay dividends, service and repay external financing and, when appropriate, buy back shares of our outstanding common stock. Our sources of funds, primarily from operations and, to the extent necessary , from external financing arrangements, are sufficient to meet ongoing operating and investing requirements over the next 12 months and beyond.\n\nOur cash and cash equivalents balance is $4.2 billion as of December 31, 2024. Our cash and cash equivalents are held both domestically and internationally , and are invested to maintain principal and provide liquidity . See \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures A bout M arket Risk\" for additional information regarding our foreign currency risk management strategies.\n\nWe expect that our capital spending requirements will continue to be financed primarily through internally generated funds. Debt or equity financing may be needed to fund additional investments or development activities, including, for example, to complete our acquisition of Frontier, or to maintain an appropriate capital structure to ensure our financial flexibility . Our ex ternal financing arrangements include credit facilities and other bank lines of credit, an active commercial paper program, vendor financing arrangements, issuances of registered debt or equity securities, U.S. retail medium-term notes and other securities that are privately-placed or offered overseas. In addition, we monetize certain receivables through asset-backed debt transactions.\n\n## Capital Expenditures\n\nOur 2025 capital program includes capital to fund advanced networks and services, including expanding and adding capacity and density to our core networks, the ongoing deployment of C-Band spectrum, and advancing our network architecture. It will also support our broadband expansion plans including the launch of our fixed wireless access solution for multi-dwelling units. We anticipate cash requirements for our 2025 capital program to be between $17.5 billion and $18.5 billion.\n\n## Contractual Obligations and Commitments\n\nWe have various contractual obligations and commitments. The following represent our anticipated material cash requirements from known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2024:\n\n- Long-term debt, including current maturities, commitments of $142.2 billion, of which $21.7 billion (including $3.3 billion of unsecured debt) are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Related interest payments are $66.3 billion, of which $5.8 billion, are expected to be due within the next twelve months. Items included in long-term debt with variable coupon rates exclude unamortized debt issuance costs, and are described in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements.",

      "answer": "The Business Wireline segment experienced a 7.3% year-over-year revenue decline and a significant 43.7% drop in operating income in 2023, signaling deteriorating financial performance. These trends would typically suggest reduced future cash flows and lower market comparability. However, AT&T's impairment analysis, as disclosed on page 76, applies both discounted cash flow and market multiple valuation approaches to estimate the implied fair value of the Business Wireline reporting unit. The question centers on how AT&T's impairment analysis accounts for the current negative financial trajectory while determining fair value, particularly in light of the strategic and forward-looking assumptions inherent in discounted cash flow modeling and market-based valuations. This synthesis reveals whether AT&T is projecting a turnaround, accepting a structural decline, or adjusting its valuation methodology in response to current performance.",

      "question": "How does the decline in in-park spending at domestic theme parks, as reflected in the 2024 Theme Parks segment results, relate to the increased operational and preopening costs associated with Epic Universe, and what does this imply about the financial strategy behind the expansion?",
      "answer": "The 2024 Theme Parks segment results show that domestic revenue declined due to reduced park attendance, which directly affected in-park spending\u2014a key revenue driver. At the same time, segment costs increased due to higher operational expenses and preopening costs for Epic Universe, which is set to open in May 2025. This suggests a strategic trade-off: despite short-term revenue declines and rising costs, the company is investing heavily in expansion to drive long-term growth and guest engagement. The financial strategy hinges on leveraging new attractions like Epic Universe to reverse attendance trends and boost in-park spending in future periods.",

We also produce television content jointly as co-producers with third-party studios and production companies. Our television studios produce content primarily under the following names:\n\n- Universal Television\n- Universal Content Productions\n- Universal Television Alternative Studio\n- Universal International Studios\n- Sky Studios\n\nOur original content is primarily initially licensed to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, including those in our Media and Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segments. We also license content after its initial airing, license older television content from our television library, and distribute owned and acquired content globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products.  The production and distribution costs related to original broadcast television content generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial license, which means that obtaining additional licenses following the initial network license is critical to the content's financial success. Similar to our film studios, we typically owe residuals and participations payments in connection with television studio productions.\n\n## Theme Parks Segment\n\nOur Theme Parks segment primarily includes the operations of the following Universal theme parks:\n\n- Universal Orlando Resort : Includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, and our water park, V olcano Bay, all of which are located in Orlando, Florida. Universal Orlando Resort also includes Universal CityWalk Orlando, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and features onsite themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest, and will include an additional theme park, Epic Universe, that is expected to open in May 2025.\n- Universal Studios Hollywood : Includes the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park located in Hollywood, California and Universal CityWalk Hollywood, a dining, retail and entertainment complex.\n- Universal Studios Japan : Includes the Universal Studios Japan theme park located in Osaka, Japan.\n- Universal  Beijing  Resort :  Includes  the  Universal  Studios  Beijing  theme  park,  as  well  as  Universal  CityWalk  Beijing,  a  dining,  retail  and  entertainment complex, and on-site themed hotels, all of which are located in Beijing, China. Universal Beijing Resort is owned by us and a consortium of Chinese stateowned companies (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\nOur Theme Parks segment properties are primarily owned by us, although certain properties are leased, including land in Beijing, China and Osaka, Japan. We have invested and will continue to invest significantly in ex isting and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, as well as in new destinations and ex periences, such as Epic Universe; Universal Kids Resort, a smaller-scale theme park in Frisco, Texas expected to open in 2026; and Universal Horror Unleashed, a year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas, Nevada expected to open in 2025.\n\nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks, including ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise, and from our consumer products business. Revenue for our theme parks generally depends on the overall environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on leisure and other recreational activities.\n\nWe also license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. The themed elements in our rides, attractions, and merchandising are based on intellectual property in our Studios and Media segments and intellectual property licensed from third parties under long-term agreements.\n\n## Competition\n\n## Media\n\nOur  Media  segment  competes  for  viewers'  attention  and  audience  share  with  all  forms  of  programming  provided  to  viewers,  including  DTC  streaming  service providers; television networks; local broadcast television stations; physical and digital home entertainment products; video on demand and pay-per-view services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Mobility reported operating income of $25,861 million in 2023, up from $23,812 million in 2022, representing an increase of $2,049 million. However, because the 2022 figure was increased by this substantial reallocation of expenses (which effectively lowered expenses in the prior year), the true organic growth in operating income may appear inflated.

      "answer": "The $835 million reduction in content amortization from tax incentives in 2023 directly lowers the carrying value of content assets on the balance sheet by reducing their cost basis. This aligns with the accounting treatment described in the notes, where tax incentives are applied as a reduction to the cost of content assets, which in turn affects the amortization expense over time. As a result, the net content asset value of $31.658 billion as of December 31, 2023, already reflects this cumulative impact of tax incentives, including the $835 million benefit from 2023, thereby influencing both the income statement and balance sheet presentation.",

Specifically, AT&T added 1.0 million fiber broadband customers in 2024, reaching over 9.3 million total fiber customers, and expanded 5G coverage to over 314 million people in the U.S. These infrastructure investments likely contributed to the margin improvement by enabling higher-value service offerings and operational efficiencies through a software-based network.

Additionally, in November 2024, we agreed to purchase select spectrum licenses from United States Cellular Corporation (UScellular) for approximately $1,000, subject to closing conditions, including the consummation of UScellular's proposed sale of its wireless operations and select spectrum assets to T-Mobile US, Inc.\n\nIn North America, our network covers over 440 million people with 4G LTE and over 314 million with 5G technology. In the United States, our network covers all major metropolitan areas and more than 336 million people with our LTE technology and more than 314 million people with our 5G technology.\n\nBroadband Technology In 2020, we identified fiber as a core priority for our business and enhanced our focus to ex pand our fiber footprint and grow customers. At December 31, 2024, we had more than 9.3 million fiber consumer wireline broadband customers, adding 1.0 million during the year. The expansion builds on our recent investments to convert to a software-based network, managing the migration of wireline customers to services using our fiber infrastructure to provide broadband technology. Software-based technologies align with our global leadership in software defined network (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV). This network approach delivers a demonstrable cost advantage in the deployment of next-generation technology over the traditional, hardware-intensive network approach. Our virtualized network supports next-generation applications like 5G and broadband-based services quickly and efficiently. At December 31, 2024, we had 15.3 million broadband connections, compared to 15.1 million broadband connections in the prior year.\n\nCopper Decommissioning While building the network of the future, we are actively working to exit our legacy copper network operations across the large majority of our wireline footprint. Our ex it strategy includes migrating customers to fiber and wireless alternatives, and working with policy-makers to decommission our inefficient and less reliable copper network. At December 31, 2024, we had 3.3 million network access lines in service and 127,000 DSL subscribers compared, to 4.2 million network access lines in service and 210,000 DSL subscribers in the prior year.\n\n## BUSINESS OPERATIONS\n\n## OPERATING SEGMENTS\n\nOur segments are strategic business units that offer different products and services over various technology platforms and/or in different geographies that are managed accordingly. We have two reportable segments: Communications and Latin America.\n\nAdditional information about our segments, including financial information, is included under the heading 'Segment Results' in Item 7 and in Note 4 of Item 8.\n\n## COMMUNICATIONS\n\nOur Communications segment provides wireless and wireline telecom and broadband services to consumers located in the U.S. and businesses globally. Our Communications services and products are marketed under the AT&amp;T, AT&amp;T Business, Cricket, AT&amp;T PREPAID , AT&amp;T Fiber and AT&amp;T Internet Air brand names. The Communications segment provided approximately 97% of 2024 segment operating revenues and accounted for substantially all of our 2024 total segment operating income. This segment contains the Mobility, Business Wireline and Consumer Wireline business units. SM\n\nMobility Our Mobility business unit provides nationwide wireless service to consumers and wholesale and resale wireless subscribers located in the United States by utilizing our network to provide voice and data services, including high-speed internet over wireless devices. We classify our subscribers as either postpaid, prepaid or reseller. As of December 31, 2024, we served 118 million Mobility subscribers, including 89 million postpaid (73 million phone), 19 million prepaid and 10 million through resellers. Our Mobility business unit revenue includes the following categories: service and equipment.\n\n## Service\n\nWe offer a comprehensive range of high-quality nationwide wireless voice and data communications services in a variety of pricing plans to meet the communications needs of targeted customer categories. Through FirstNet services, we also provide a nationwide wireless broadband network dedicated to public safety. \u00ae\n\nConsumers continue to require increasing availability of data-centric services and a network to connect and control those devices. An increasing number of our subscribers are using more advanced devices, including embedded computing systems and/or software, commonly called the Internet of Things (IoT). We offer unlimited plans that include features allowing for the sharing of voice, tex t and data across multiple devices, which attracts subscribers from other providers and helps minimize subscriber churn. We continue to upgrade our network and coordinate with equipment manufacturers and application developers to further capitalize on the continued growing demand for wireless data services.\n\nWe also offer nationwide wireless voice and data communications to certain customers who prefer to pay in advance. These services are offered under the Cricket and AT&amp;T PREPAID brands and are typically monthly prepaid services.",

      "answer": "Disney reported a 20% increase in subscription fees driven by subscriber growth at Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+ in fiscal year 2022. This growth is tied to the Direct-to-Consumer business segment, which generates revenue from subscription fees and relies heavily on consistent content production and consumer engagement. However, the company also disclosed that the Direct-to-Consumer segment faced disruptions due to the ongoing impacts of the pandemic, including delays or cancellations of theatrical releases and content production interruptions. These disruptions could affect the availability of new content, which is critical for sustaining subscriber growth and engagement. Additionally, the company noted that the pandemic had altered consumer behavior, potentially impacting long-term demand for streaming services and content consumption patterns. Therefore, while the subscription fee growth appears strong, the underlying risks related to content production delays and shifting consumer preferences present a challenge to the sustainability of this growth trajectory.",

(3)\n\n## BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS\n\nBelow is a discussion of the major revenue and expense categories for our business segments. Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\nDMED primarily generates revenue across three significant lines of business/distribution platforms: Linear Networks, Directto-Consumer and Content Sales/Licensing. Programming and production costs to support these businesses/distribution platforms are largely incurred across four content creation groups: Studios, General Entertainment, Sports and International. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed programming rights (including sports rights), amortization of capitalized production costs, subscriber-based fees for programming our Hulu services, production costs related to live programming such as news and sports and amortization of participations and residual obligations. These costs are generally allocated across the DMED businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows. The initial costs of marketing campaigns are generally recognized in the DMED business/distribution platform of initial exploitation. We have taken an intentionally flexible approach to distribution. As we refine and adjust our plans, our decisions may impact the results of operations of the businesses within DMED, including cost allocation, revenue timing, viewership timing and patterns, the total mix of content on a business/distribution platform or other aspects relevant to the performance of each business/distribution platform. For example, a shift in the timing or planned business/platform of distribution impacts the timing and allocation of programming, production and marketing costs.\n\nThe Linear Networks business generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising sales and from fees from sub-licensing of sports programming to third parties. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs.\n\nThe Direct-to-Consumer business generates revenue from subscription fees, advertising sales and pay-per-view and Premier Access fees. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Operating expenses also include fees paid to Linear Networks for the right to air the linear network feeds and other services.\n\nThe Content Sales/Licensing business generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic television content in the TV/SVOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Operating expenses include programming and production costs, distribution expenses and costs of sales.\n\nDPEP primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.",

          "chunk_text": "## TABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n## ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\n\nFor an enterprise as large and complex as the Company, a wide range of factors could materially affect future developments and performance. In addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere in our filings with the SEC, the most significant factors affecting our business include the following:\n\n## BUSINESS, ECONOMIC, MARKET and OPERATING CONDITION RISKS\n\n## The adverse impact of COVID-19 on our businesses will continue for an unknown length of time and may continue to impact certain of our key sources of revenue.\n\nSince early 2020, the world has been and continues to be impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread have impacted our segments in a number of ways, most significantly at DPEP where our theme parks and resorts were closed and cruise ship sailings and guided tours were suspended. In addition, at DMED we delayed, or in some cases, shortened or canceled theatrical releases and experienced disruptions in the production and availability of content. Collectively, our impacted businesses have historically been the source of the majority of our revenue. Operations have resumed at various points since May 2020, with certain theme parks and resort operations and film and television productions resuming by the end of fiscal 2020 and throughout 2021. Although operations resumed, many of our businesses continue to experience impacts from COVID-19, such as incremental health and safety measures and related increased expenses, capacity restrictions and closures (including at some of our international parks and in theaters in certain markets), and disruptions of content production activities.\n\nCOVID-19 impacts and future health outbreaks and pandemics could hasten the erosion of historical sources of revenue at our Linear Networks businesses and change consumer preferences. For example, COVID-19 impacts have changed, and may continue to change, consumer behavior and consumption patterns, such as theater-going to watch movies. Some industries in which our customers operate, such as theatrical distribution, retail and travel, have experienced, and could continue to experience, contraction and financial distress, which could impact the profitability of our businesses going forward.\n\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our businesses have had, or may continue to have, negative impacts. For example, in response to COVID-19 impacts, we incurred significant additional indebtedness and delayed or suspended certain projects in which we have invested, particularly at our parks and resorts and studio operations. In addition, we may take mitigation actions in the future to respond to the impacts of COVID-19 or other health outbreaks or pandemics on our businesses, such as raising additional financing; not declaring future dividends; further suspending or reducing capital spending; reducing film and television content investments; implementing furloughs or reductions in force or modifying our operating strategy. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our businesses. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19 and other health outbreaks or pandemics, including the fixed costs of our theme park business and the impact such events may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\n\nGeographic variation in government requirements and ongoing changes to restrictions have disrupted and could further disrupt our businesses, including our production operations. Our operations could be suspended, re-suspended or subjected to new or reinstated limitations by government action or otherwise in the future as a result of developments related to COVID-19, such as the expansion of the Omicron subvariants or other variants, and other future health outbreaks and pandemics. For example, our international parks have reopened and closed multiple times since the onset of COVID-19. Some of our employees who returned to work were later refurloughed. Our operations could be further negatively impacted and our reputation could be negatively impacted by a significant COVID-19 or other health outbreak impacting our employees, customers or others interacting with our businesses, including our supply chain.\n\nThe impacts of COVID-19 to our business have generally amplified, or reduced our ability to mitigate, the other risks discussed in our filings with the SEC and our remediation efforts may not be successful.\n\nCOVID-19 also makes it more challenging for management to estimate future performance of our businesses. COVID-19 has already adversely impacted our businesses and net cash flow, and we expect the ultimate magnitude of these disruptions on our financial and operational results will be dictated by the length of time that such disruptions continue which will, in turn, depend on the currently unknowable duration and severity of the impacts of COVID-19, and among other things, the impact and duration of governmental actions imposed in response to COVID-19 and individuals' and companies' risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward.\n\n## Changes in U.S., global, and regional economic conditions are expected to have an adverse effect on the profitability of our businesses.\n\nA decline in economic conditions, such as recession, economic downturn, and/or inflationary conditions in the U.S. and other regions of the world in which we do business can adversely affect demand and/or expenses for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. Past declines in economic conditions reduced spending at our parks and resorts, purchases",

      "question": "How does Verizon's capital expenditure strategy on network infrastructure align with the reorganization of the Enterprise and Public Sector segment, particularly in relation to the integration of Commercial Wireline Customers?",
      "answer": "Verizon invested $18.8 billion in capital expenditures during 2023, focusing on 5G, C-Band spectrum deployment, and fiber-based networks to support growing demand for high-speed connections. This investment supports the company's strategic shift toward enterprise and public sector markets, which was formalized through the Q1 2023 reorganization. In that reorganization, the Enterprise and Public Sector segment absorbed Commercial Wireline Customers previously under the Small and Medium Business group. This integration reflects a broader strategic alignment to strengthen Verizon\u2019s position in the enterprise market by consolidating business-focused wireline services under a unified segment. The capital investments in fiber and 5G infrastructure directly support the service offerings and customer needs within this newly structured Enterprise and Public Sector segment, particularly for Commercial Wireline Customers now embedded within it.",

      "answer": "Disney reported a slight 1% increase in total programming and production costs in FY2024, with Hulu costs rising by 4% while Disney+ and other costs decreased by 3%. These costs are a core component of the Entertainment segment's operating expenses, which include amortization of production costs, subscriber-based fees, and intersegment fees paid to the Sports segment. The Entertainment segment's strategic focus includes global film and television content production and distribution, supported by intersegment revenue allocations from the Experiences segment meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing. This suggests that despite cost pressures, particularly from Hulu, Disney is strategically investing in content creation while leveraging internal revenue streams to offset some of these expenses.",

Costs and expenses for each segment consist of operating expenses, selling, general, administrative and other costs, and depreciation and amortization. Selling, general, administrative and other costs include third-party and internal marketing expenses.\n\n## Entertainment\n\nThe Entertainment segment generates revenue from film, episodic and other content that is produced and distributed across three significant lines of business:\n\n- Linear Networks, which primarily generates revenue from affiliate fees and advertising\n- Direct-to-Consumer, which primarily generates revenue from subscription fees and advertising\n- Content Sales/Licensing, which primarily generates revenue from the sale of film and episodic content in the TV/VOD and home entertainment markets, distribution of films in the theatrical market, licensing of our music rights, sales of tickets to stage play performances and licensing of our IP for use in stage plays. Revenues also include an intersegment allocation of revenues from the Experiences segment, which is meant to reflect royalties on consumer products merchandise licensing revenues generated on IP created by the Entertainment segment.\n\nOperating expenses at the Entertainment segment primarily consist of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include the following:\n\n- Amortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights\n- Subscriber-based fees for programming the Hulu Live service, including fees paid by Hulu to the Sports segment and other Entertainment segment businesses for the right to air their linear networks on Hulu Live\n- Production costs related to live programming (primarily news)\n- Participations and residual expenses\n- Fees paid to the Sports segment to program ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+\n\nAmortization of capitalized production costs and licensed programming rights is generally allocated across Entertainment's businesses based on the estimated relative value of the distribution windows.

      "question": "How does Disney's reported revenue from hotel room nights relate to the cost structure of its Experiences segment, particularly given the segment's significant infrastructure and labor expenses?",
      "answer": "Disney reports hotel room nights as a distinct revenue stream within its Experiences segment on page 84. This segment, as detailed on page 38, generates revenue from multiple sources including charges for room nights at hotels, alongside significant expenses tied to operating labor and infrastructure, such as technology support, utilities, property taxes, and transportation. While hotel room revenue contributes to the segment's income, the cost structure reveals that high fixed and variable operating costs may impact overall profitability. Therefore, the financial performance of the Experiences segment depends on balancing hotel revenue with these substantial labor and infrastructure costs.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: DIS(page_84) \u2192 Hotel Room Nights: Disney explicitly lists hotel room nights as a revenue stream under its financial disclosures, indicating its importance to overall income.",

The fiscal 2023 presentation has been adjusted to conform with the fiscal 2024 presentation. (1)\n\n## 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements of the Company include the accounts of The Walt Disney Company and its majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\nThe Company enters into relationships with or makes investments in other entities that may be variable interest entities (VIE). A VIE is consolidated in the financial statements if the Company has the power to direct activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the VIE and has the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant (as defined by ASC 810-10-25-38) to the VIE. Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Shanghai Disney Resort (together, the Asia Theme Parks) are VIEs in which the Company has less than 50% equity ownership. Company subsidiaries (the Management Companies) have management agreements with the Asia Theme Parks, which provide the Management Companies, subject to certain protective rights of joint venture partners, with the ability to direct the day-to-day operating activities and the development of business strategies that we believe most significantly impact the economic performance of the Asia Theme Parks. In addition, the Management Companies receive management fees under these arrangements that we believe could be significant to the Asia Theme Parks. Therefore, the Company has consolidated the Asia Theme Parks in its financial statements.\n\n## Reporting Period\n\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to September 30 and consists of fifty-two weeks with the exception that approximately every six years, we have a fifty-three week year. When a fifty-three week year occurs, the Company reports the additional week in the fourth quarter. Fiscal 2024, 2023 and 2022 were fifty-two week years.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2024 presentation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. Actual results may differ from those estimates.\n\n## Revenues and Costs from Services and Products\n\nThe Company generates revenue from the sale of both services and tangible products and revenues and operating costs are classified under these two categories in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Certain costs related to both the sale of services and tangible products are not specifically allocated between the service or tangible product revenue streams but are instead attributed to the principal revenue stream. The cost of services and tangible products exclude depreciation and amortization.\n\nSignificant service revenues include:\n\n- Subscription fees to our DTC streaming services\n- Affiliate fees\n- Advertising revenues\n- Admissions to our theme parks, charges for room nights at hotels and sales of cruise vacation packages\n- Revenue from the licensing and distribution of film and television properties\n- Royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods, published materials and in multi-platform games",

      "question": "How does the complexity and subjectivity in estimating content amortization patterns on existing and new content, which is based on historical and forecasted viewing trends, reconcile with the $1,104 million year-over-year increase in cost of revenues directly attributed to content amortization?",
      "answer": "The 2024 10-K highlights that content amortization is a complex and subjective process, dependent on estimated viewing patterns derived from historical and forecasted viewing trends (page 38). This subjectivity can lead to changes in amortization timing if actual viewing deviates from estimates. The financial statements confirm that the $1,104 million year-over-year increase in cost of revenues for 2024 was primarily driven by higher content amortization costs related to both existing and new content (page 23). Meanwhile, page 62 shows that cost of revenues for the year totaled $1,629 million, aligning with the significant increase tied to content amortization. This suggests that the volatility in amortization estimates has a direct and material impact on reported cost of revenues, raising questions about the stability and predictability of this expense line item.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

      "answer": "META allocated 80% of its total costs and expenses, amounting to $70.13 billion, to the Family of Apps (FoA) segment in 2023, reflecting its primary investment focus on developing and maintaining its core social platforms. Despite this substantial investment, the company also recorded $1.10 billion in restructuring charges under the FoA segment related to 2023 layoffs. This indicates that while the FoA remains the dominant area of investment, META implemented cost-cutting measures within this segment, likely aimed at improving operational efficiency or reallocating resources toward strategic priorities like AI and the metaverse. The juxtaposition of high investment levels with restructuring charges suggests a recalibration of resource allocation to align with long-term strategic goals while managing near-term financial pressures.",

      "answer": "The Business Wireline segment experienced a 9.9% year-over-year decline in operating revenues, dropping from $20,883 million in 2023 to $18,819 million in 2024, and transitioned to an operating loss of $88 million from a profit of $1,289 million the prior year. This deterioration in financial performance is directly tied to the segment's operational challenges. On page 72, AT&T discloses that the Business Wireline reporting unit was subjected to nonrecurring fair value measurements due to impairment indicators. These measurements used discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches, signaling that the company recognized the segment's declining performance as a potential indicator of asset impairment. Therefore, the fair value disclosure on page 72 reflects and responds to the financial deterioration detailed in the operating performance data from page 25, which is part of the broader operating revenues section on page 23.",

      "answer": "The company recognizes tax incentives earned on qualified production spend as a reduction to the cost basis of content assets, which lowers content amortization over the life of the title. In 2023, this resulted in $835 million in lower amortization expenses. This benefit is reflected in both the content asset valuation on the balance sheet and the cost of revenues on the income statement. Additionally, the tax incentives are accounted for within the broader income tax provision, where the company evaluates the realizability of deferred tax assets and incorporates assumptions about future taxable income and tax planning strategies. This integrated treatment ensures that both the asset base and tax liabilities are adjusted to reflect the economic benefits of these incentives.",

      "question": "How does the strong operating income contribution from Mobility in 2024 reconcile with the overall operating loss reported by the company, particularly given the decline in total operating income (loss) from $1,289 million in 2023 to a loss of $88 million in 2024?",
      "answer": "Mobility contributed a significant $23,812 million in operating income in 2024, which contrasts sharply with the overall operating loss of $88 million reported by the company. This discrepancy is explained by the poor performance of other segments and corporate activities. For example, the Corporate and Other segment reported an operating loss of $2,890 million, and the 'Certain significant items' category added an additional $28,107 million loss. These losses, combined with declines in other business units like Latin America - Mexico (which reported a loss of $326 million), overwhelmed the strong performance of Mobility. Additionally, the company-wide operating income (loss) declined significantly from $1,289 million in 2023 to a loss of $88 million in 2024, reflecting the growing drag from underperforming segments and corporate-level costs.",

        "Hop 1: T(page_56) \u2192 Mobility: Mobility is a key business segment of AT&T, generating $81,780 million in revenue and contributing $23,812 million in operating income in 2024.",
        "Hop 2: Mobility \u2192 Operating Income (Loss): Mobility's operating income is a major component of the overall operating income (loss) metric disclosed in the consolidated financial results.",

      "answer": "The 4% increase in Hulu's programming and production costs, amounting to a $317 million year-over-year rise, is directly tied to the Entertainment segment's reported costs, which include production expenses related to live programming\u2014primarily news. This cost increase is further influenced by intersegment fees paid to the Sports segment for programming content such as ESPN on ABC and certain sports content on Disney+. Despite this increase, the Entertainment segment managed to reduce costs in other areas, such as the 3% year-over-year decline in Disney+ programming expenses, which partially offset the overall rise in content production costs.",

      "answer": "The Communications Segment experienced a slight decline in operating income margin from 23.6% in 2023 to 23.0% in 2024, despite the Consumer Wireline sub-segment showing strong growth with a 33.5% increase in operating income year-over-year. This positive performance from Consumer Wireline contrasts with the broader segment's slight decline, suggesting that other parts of the Communications Segment (like Business Wireline) may have underperformed. Further, the inclusion of Consumer Wireline in nonrecurring fair value measurements\u2014specifically in the impairment testing of goodwill and long-lived assets using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches\u2014indicates that despite its growth, the unit's future cash flow assumptions or market valuation may have been subject to scrutiny or downward adjustment, potentially affecting the overall segment's financial outlook.",

However, this growth contrasts with a 17.3% decline in consolidated operating revenues, which dropped from $3,154 million in 2020 to $2,607 million in 2021. This discrepancy can be partially explained by intercompany eliminations of $5,253 million noted in the segment revenue table, which reduce consolidated totals. Additionally, the consolidated view includes underperforming segments like Latin America and Corporate & Other, which declined by 23.0% and 5.3% respectively, pulling down the overall revenue despite Mobility\u2019s strong performance.",

      "answer": "Disney's Entertainment segment incurs significant operating expenses related to the amortization of licensed programming rights, which totaled $13.4 billion in 2023. This amortization is a core component of programming and production costs and is allocated across the segment\u2019s businesses, including its direct-to-consumer and linear networks operations. Given that the Entertainment segment reported $16.4 billion in subscription fees and $7.6 billion in advertising revenue in 2023, the high amortization costs likely place downward pressure on segment profitability, despite strong revenue generation. This suggests that content investment remains a major cost driver even as the segment monetizes its content through multiple revenue streams.",

      "question": "What factors drove NBCUniversal's 6% Adjusted EBITDA growth to $5.7 billion in 2021 despite ongoing pandemic-related challenges?",
      "answer": "NBCUniversal's Adjusted EBITDA grew by 6% to $5.7 billion in 2021 despite pandemic-related disruptions, primarily due to operational recovery in key business segments. The Theme Parks segment rebounded significantly, with revenue increasing 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA turning positive at $1.3 billion, driven by the reopening of parks that had been temporarily closed or operating under capacity restrictions in 2020. The Studios segment also contributed, with revenue rising 16.2% to $9.4 billion as production operations returned to full capacity and content licensing revenue improved. Although the Media segment Adjusted EBITDA declined by 18% to $4.6 billion due in part to the Tokyo Olympics broadcast, it still benefited from higher distribution and advertising revenue. Additionally, the reduction in NBCUniversal\u2019s debt from $2.8 billion in 2020 to $1.6 billion in 2021 reflects improved financial positioning, supporting overall EBITDA performance despite lingering pandemic effects.",

The following summary provides a discussion of current and potential future effects of the pandemic with direct impacts to our businesses.\n\n## NBCUniversal\n\n- Our  theme  parks  in  Orlando  and  Hollywood  operated  without  capacity  restrictions,  following  periods  with  capacity restrictions in place in the second quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Hollywood began requiring proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test result for park entry in accordance with local requirements in the fourth quarter of 2021. Our theme park in Japan began operating without capacity restrictions in the fourth quarter of 2021, following periods with capacity restrictions in place. Our newest theme park, Universal Beijing Resort, opened in September 2021 with capacity restrictions. The capacity restrictions and temporary closures of our theme parks had a significant impact on our revenue and Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis. The results of operations at our theme parks may continue to be negatively impacted  and  we  cannot  predict  if  our  parks  will  remain  open  or  be  subject  to  capacity  restrictions,  or  the  level  of attendance at our reopened parks. The development of the Epic Universe theme park in Orlando resumed in 2021 after having been paused in 2020.\n- Delays  to  the  start  of  seasons  for  certain  professional  sports  leagues,  including  the  2020-21  NHL  and  NBA  seasons, resulted in the shift of additional events into the first half of 2021 compared to a normal year. The delays impacted the timing of revenue and expense recognition, because both advertising revenue and costs associated with broadcasting these programs are recognized when events are broadcast. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021. In addition, the Tokyo Olympics were postponed from the third quarter of 2020 to the third quarter of 2021, resulting in a corresponding delay of the associated revenue and costs.\n- Our studio production operations have generally returned to full capacity. We delayed or altered the theatrical distribution strategy for certain of our films, both domestically and internationally as a result of the temporary closures and limited capacity  operations  of  many  movie  theaters  worldwide  caused  by  COVID-19.  Delays  in  theatrical  releases  affect  both current  and  future  periods  as  a  result  of  corresponding  delays  in  subsequent  content  licensing  windows.  Results  of operations in our Studios segment may be negatively impacted over the near to medium term as a result of COVID-19.\n\n## Sky\n\n- Direct-to-consumer revenue has been negatively impacted, and future periods may be negatively impacted, as a result of lower sports subscription revenue due to the closures and extent of reopening of our commercial customers' locations. In addition, delays to the start of the 2020-21 seasons for certain sports, including European football, resulted in the shift of additional events and the significant costs associated with broadcasting these programs into the first and second quarters of 2021 compared to a normal year. The timing of sports seasons generally returned to a normal calendar beginning in the third quarter of 2021.\n\nComcast 2021 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

Excluding $1.8 billion of revenue associated with our broadcast of the Tokyo Olympics in 2021, revenue in the Media segment increased 11.0%, primarily due to increases in distribution revenue, advertising revenue and other revenue, including the effects of COVID-19 in the prior year period.\n- Media segment results include the operations of Peacock, which in 2021 generated revenue of $778 million and operating costs and expenses of $2.5 billion, compared to revenue of $118 million and operating costs and expenses of $781 million in 2020. We continued to invest in content and grow our customer base during 2021, and in the fourth quarter of 2021, we introduced certain ad-supported Peacock programming into Sky video services, launching first in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n- Studios segment revenue increased 16.2% to $9.4 billion, due to increases in content licensing revenue, theatrical revenue and  home  entertainment  and  other  revenue  as  our  film  and  television  production  operations  returned  to  full  capacity. Studios revenue included licenses of content to our Media and other segments, including the impact of a new licensing agreement  for  content  that  became  exclusively  available  for  streaming  on  Peacock  in  2021,  and  the  impacts  of  initial content licenses associated with the launch of Peacock in 2020, which are eliminated in consolidation.\n- Theme Parks segment revenue increased 141.2% to $5.1 billion and Adjusted EBITDA increased from $(0.5) billion to $1.3 billion, reflecting the operation of our theme parks in the current year period compared to temporary closures and capacity restrictions as a result of COVID-19 in the prior year period and the opening of our theme park in Beijing, China in September 2021.\n- Revenue increased 9.1% to $20.3 billion. Excluding the impact of foreign currency, Sky revenue increased 3.1% due to increases  in  advertising  and  direct-to-consumer  revenue,  partially  offset  by  a  decrease  in  content  revenue,  which  were affected by COVID-19 in the prior year period and reduced broadcast rights for Serie A in the current year period.\n- Adjusted  EBITDA increased  20.8%  to  $2.4  billion.  Excluding  the  impact  of  foreign  currency,  Sky Adjusted  EBITDA increased 10.2% primarily due to increases in revenue and decreases in programming and production expenses, partially offset by increases in direct network costs and other expenses.\n\n## Other\n\n- Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA losses decreased from $1.8 billion to $1.4 billion primarily due to costs incurred in the prior year period in response to COVID-19, including severance charges related to our businesses.\n- Resumed our share repurchase program in the second quarter of 2021. We repurchased a total of 73.2 million shares of our Class A common stock for $4.0 billion in 2021. Raised our dividend by $0.08 to $1.00 per share on an annualized basis in January 2021 and paid $4.5 billion of dividends in 2021.\n- Reduced debt by $8.9 billion in 2021 and ended the year with $94.8 billion of total short-term and long-term debt and $8.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents.\n\n## Impacts of COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 and measures taken to prevent its spread across the globe have impacted our businesses in a number of ways, with the most significant effects in 2020, affecting the comparability of periods included in this report. COVID-19 has had material negative impacts on NBCUniversal and Sky results of operations primarily due to the temporary restrictions and closures at our theme parks and the impacts of professional sports, respectively. We expect the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to adversely impact our consolidated results of operations over the near to medium term, although the extent of such\n\n## Sky",

      "answer": "The $95 million in contributions made by Disney to its postretirement medical plans during fiscal 2024 is significantly lower than the $657 million net loss included in AOCI for these plans. This discrepancy highlights that while Disney is making relatively modest current-year contributions, the long-term funded status of the plans is deteriorating due to actuarial losses and prior service costs. The AOCI figure reflects accumulated, unrealized losses that will eventually impact earnings and equity as they are amortized over time, suggesting that future financial obligations may increase despite current low contribution levels.",

      "answer": "The 7% increase in 'Costs and expenses' for the Family of Apps segment from 2023 to 2024 ($70,135 million to $75,246 million) appears to contrast with the stated completion of the 2022 restructuring initiatives by the end of 2024, which included layoffs of approximately 11,000 employees across the Family of Apps and Reality Labs segments and facilities consolidation efforts aimed at reducing costs. This suggests that despite the restructuring efforts intended to drive efficiency, the Family of Apps segment still experienced rising costs, potentially due to continued investment in core platforms, inflationary pressures, or upfront costs associated with restructuring implementation.",

Restructuring\n\n## 2022 Restructuring\n\nIn 2022, we initiated several measures to pursue greater efficiency and to realign our business and strategic priorities. These measures included a facilities consolidation strategy to sublease, early terminate, or abandon several office buildings under operating leases, a layoff of approximately 11,000 employees across the Family of Apps (FoA) and Reality Labs (RL) segments, and a pivot towards a next generation data center design, including cancellation of multiple data center projects (the 2022 Restructuring). As of December 31, 2024, we have completed the 2022 restructuring initiatives.\n\nA summary of our 2022 Restructuring pre-tax charges for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022, including subsequent adjustments, is as follows (in millions):\n\n",

      "question": "How does the significant growth in Domestic Revenue for Disney Parks, Experiences and Products compare with the capital expenditures allocated to this segment in 2022, and what might this suggest about Disney's strategic investment priorities?",
      "answer": "Disney reported a >100% increase in Domestic Revenue for Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, reaching $20,131 million in 2022 compared to $9,353 million in 2021. This growth was supported by capital expenditures of $2,680 million in 2022 for the Domestic segment under Disney Parks, Experiences and Products, up from $1,597 million in 2021. The significant capital investment aligns with the revenue surge, suggesting that Disney prioritized infrastructure and operational expansion in its domestic parks business to capitalize on the rebound in consumer demand post-pandemic.",

      "answer": "Weak economic conditions negatively impact Comcast's advertising revenue, which directly affects the average monthly total revenue per customer relationship\u2014a metric that includes advertising and other revenue streams. Since the company emphasizes growing higher-margin businesses and evaluates profitability through service mix changes, a decline in advertising revenue could limit its ability to offset declining traditional service revenues or invest in higher-margin offerings. This creates a constraint on their strategic focus, as economic weakness undermines both a key revenue component and the financial flexibility needed to shift toward more profitable services.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Weak economic conditions may have a negative impact on our businesses.\n\nA substantial portion of our revenue comes from customers whose spending patterns may be affected by prevailing economic conditions. Weak economic conditions in  the  United  States,  in  Europe  or  globally  could  adversely  affect  demand  for  any  of  our  products  and  services  and  have  a  negative  impact  on  our  results  of operations. For example, weak economic conditions will likely impact our customers' discretionary spending and as a result, they may reduce the level of services to which they subscribe or may discontinue subscribing to one or more of our services altogether. This risk may be increased by the expanded availability of free or lower cost competitive services, such as certain DTC streaming services, or substitute services for broadband and voice services, such as wireless and public Wi-Fi networks. Weak economic conditions also negatively impact our advertising revenue, the performance of our films and home entertainment releases, and attendance and spending in our theme parks.  In  particular,  the  success  of  our  theme  parks  and  theatrical  releases  largely  depends  on  consumer  demand  for  out-of-home entertainment experiences, which may be limited by weakened economic conditions. Weak economic conditions may also cause governments and regulators to impose additional tax or product affordability regulations, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations.\n\nWeak economic conditions and disruptions in the global financial markets, such as high interest rates, may impact our ability to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt on acceptable terms, if at all, which could increase the cost of our borrowings over time and may increase our exposure to currency fluctuations in countries where we operate. Further, inflationary pressures in the United States, in Europe and globally may also have negative impacts on our cost structure and pricing models and may impact the ability of third parties (including advertisers, customers, suppliers, wholesale distributors, retailers and content creators, among others) to satisfy their obligations to us.\n\n## Acquisitions and other strategic initiatives present many risks, and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals that we had contemplated.\n\nFrom time  to  time,  we  make  acquisitions  and  investments  and  may  pursue  other  strategic  initiatives,  such  as  the  proposed  Spin-off.  In  connection  with  such acquisitions  and  strategic  initiatives,  we  may  incur  significant  or  unanticipated  ex penses,  fail  to  realize  anticipated  benefits  and  synergies,  have  difficulty incorporating an acquired or new line of business, disrupt relationships with current and new employees, customers and vendors, incur significant debt, divert the attention of management from our current operations, or have to delay or not proceed with announced transactions or initiatives. These and other circumstances could also result in the impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets. Additionally, federal regulatory or antitrust agencies such as the FCC or DOJ or international regulators may impose restrictions on the operation of our businesses as a result of our seeking regulatory approvals for any significant acquisitions and strategic initiatives or may dissuade us from pursuing certain transactions. The occurrence of any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\n## We face risks relating to doing business internationally that could adversely affect our businesses.\n\nWe operate our businesses worldwide. There are risks inherent in doing business internationally, including global financial market turmoil; economic volatility and global economic slowdown; currency exchange rate fluctuations and inflationary pressures; geopolitical risks, including acts of terror and war; requirements of local laws and customs relating to the publication and distribution of content and the display and sale of advertising; import or export restrictions, tariffs, sanctions and trade regulations; difficulties in developing, staffing and managing foreign operations; issues related to occupational safety and adherence to diverse local labor laws and regulations; and potentially adverse tax developments. Additionally, although we employ foreign currency derivative instruments to hedge certain exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risks, including the British pound, euro and Japanese yen, the use of such derivative instruments may not be sufficient to mitigate exchange rate fluctuations. In addition, doing business internationally subjects us to risks relating to political or social unrest, as well as corruption and government regulations, including U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Bribery Act, that impose stringent requirements on how we conduct our foreign operations. Moreover, foreign enforcement of laws and contractual rights in certain countries where we do business can be inconsistent and unpredictable, which may affect our ability to enforce our rights or make investments that we believe otherwise make strategic sense. If any of these events occur or our conduct does not comply with such laws and regulations, our businesses may be adversely affected.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "question": "How does the amortization of capitalized production costs, as a major expense in the Entertainment segment, align with the segment's reported revenue streams, particularly in relation to TV/VOD distribution licensing and home entertainment revenue?",
      "answer": "The amortization of capitalized production costs is a significant operating expense under the Entertainment segment, directly tied to the production and licensing of content. This expense is allocated across the segment\u2019s businesses, including TV/VOD and home entertainment, based on the estimated relative value of distribution windows. In 2023, the Entertainment segment reported $2,645 million in TV/VOD distribution licensing revenue and $931 million in home entertainment revenue. These figures represent key monetization channels for the content whose production costs are being amortized. Therefore, the amortization expense reflects the ongoing cost recovery associated with these revenue-generating activities, particularly in markets where Disney distributes its episodic and film content through digital and physical formats.",

      "answer": "The decline in Business Wireline's contribution to operating revenues, which fell by 0.3% overall in 2024 due to lower demand for legacy services and the absence of cybersecurity revenues, contrasts with the company's continued reliance on discounted cash flow models for its nonrecurring fair value measurements. Despite the segment's weakening revenue and operating income performance, the company still uses forward-looking cash flow projections as a key input in estimating the implied fair value of the Business Wireline reporting unit. This suggests an expectation that the segment will generate sufficient future cash flows to support its current asset valuations, despite recent financial headwinds.",

The investments  that  we  are  making  across  Google  Services,  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that  are  useful  to  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content providers. Our investments in Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital  and,  in  pursuing  new  strategies,  we  may  incur  unanticipated  liabilities. These  endeavors  may  involve  significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  diversion  of  resources  and  management  attention  from  current  operations  and,  with respect  to  Other  Bets,  the  use  of  alternative  investment,  governance,  or  compensation  structures  that  may  fail  to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\n\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in  product  price  and  performance  characteristics,  and  price  and  feature  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\n\nWithin  Google  Cloud,  we  devote  significant  resources  to  develop  and  deploy  our  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.\n\nWithin  Other  Bets,  we  are  investing  significantly  in  the  areas  of  health,  life  sciences,  and  transportation,  among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\n\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\n\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition. Changes  in  device  mix,  geographic  mix,  ongoing  product  and  policy  changes,  product  mix,  and  property  mix  and  an increasing  competition  for  advertising  may  also  affect  our  advertising  revenue  growth  rate.  We  may  also  experience  a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other factors.\n\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such  as  the  continued  expansion  of  our  business  into  new  fields,  including  products  and  services  such  as  hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increased costs for many aspects of our business. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible  we  may  not  be  able  to  protect  some  of  these  innovations.  Moreover,  we  may  not  have  adequate  patent  or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.",

      "answer": "Disney's consolidated financial data shows an 8% year-over-year increase in infrastructure costs, rising from $3.127 billion in 2023 to $3.363 billion in 2024. The Experiences segment, which explicitly incurs infrastructure costs, includes line items such as technology support, utilities, property taxes, and insurance as significant components of these costs.

      "answer": "AT&T's Business Wireline reporting unit was subjected to nonrecurring fair value measurements due to impairment indicators, as disclosed on page 72. This reflects concerns about the unit's valuation amid a significant drop in operating income from $1,289 million in 2023 to a loss of $88 million in 2024 (page 25). Despite this deterioration in Business Wireline performance, the broader Communications Segment maintained a slight EBITDA margin increase to 39.5% in 2024 (page 38), likely due to offsetting strength in the Mobility and Consumer Wireline segments. This suggests that while Business Wireline is under financial stress requiring valuation scrutiny, the overall Communications Segment remains resilient enough to support margin growth, raising questions about strategic reallocation or cost management in the segment.",

      "question": "How does the increase in T's Communications segment EBITDA margin from 38.3% in 2023 to 39.5% in 2024 align with the company's broader justification on EBITDA margin as a performance metric, especially in light of declining operating revenues?",
      "answer": "Despite a decline in operating revenues in 2024, T's Communications segment EBITDA margin increased from 38.3% in 2023 to 39.5% in 2024, suggesting improved cash generation potential even amid revenue pressures. This aligns with the company's rationale on page 38, where EBITDA margin is emphasized as a key metric for evaluating segment performance and cash generation capability. The increase in EBITDA margin may reflect cost discipline or a shift in revenue mix toward higher-margin services like Mobility and Consumer Wireline, despite declines in Business Wireline and Mobility equipment. This supports the company's position that EBITDA margin is a relevant indicator of operational efficiency and cash flow strength, even when GAAP revenues are under pressure.",

According to the inter-segment transaction disclosures, Studios recognizes content licensing revenue from Media when the content is delivered and made available for use. This licensing relationship highlights a key financial dependency: Studios monetizes its content internally, and Media relies on Studios for programming that it can distribute and monetize further. The upfront recognition of revenue by Studios contrasts with Media\u2019s cost recognition over the license period, creating timing differences in Adjusted EBITDA reporting.

This segment saw wireless service revenue of $2,162 million and equipment revenue of $982 million. Despite its relatively small share, the Latin America segment remained stable, while the overall Communications segment, which accounts for 97% of total segment operating revenues, experienced only a 0.8% year-over-year increase in operating revenues.

      "answer": "The $16.192 billion in Cable Communications segment assets as of December 31, 2021, supports the segment's role as a major consumer of Media segment content, which reported $14.7 billion in assets after the 2021 segment change. The inter-segment transactions\u2014specifically the distribution revenue in Media for fees received from Cable Communications for programming and retransmission consent agreements\u2014impact Adjusted EBITDA timing differences. These differences arise because Media recognizes revenue from content licenses at a point in time, while the associated costs are amortized over the license period, deferring profit recognition in consolidated results.

The costs of these licenses in Media and Sky are recognized as the content is used over the license period. The difference in timing of recognition between segments results in an Adjusted EBITDA impact in eliminations, as the profits (losses) on these transactions are deferred in our consolidated results and recognized as the content is used over the license period.

      "answer": "Approximately 69.7% ($1,975 out of $2,833) of T's total vendor financing payables at the end of 2023 were classified under 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities.' This aligns with the broader trend in T's balance sheet, where total 'Accounts payable and accrued liabilities' stood at $35,852 million in 2023, reflecting a decrease from $42,644 million in 2022. This suggests a reduction in short-term obligations, including those related to vendor financing.",

      "answer": "The Sports segment's operating expenses include a significant portion of operating labor, which suggests a labor-intensive model that may limit scalability due to rising labor costs and logistical complexity. In contrast, the Experiences segment focuses on capital-intensive investments such as the multi-year EPCOT transformation and the opening of CommuniCore Hall in June 2024, which are designed to enhance guest capacity and long-term revenue potential. These fixed-cost infrastructure investments may provide greater scalability over time compared to the Sports segment's labor-dependent cost structure.",

      "question": "How does the increase in Theme Parks segment revenue in 2023, driven by guest spending at international parks and the opening of Super Nintendo World, align with the seasonal fluctuations in attendance and revenue typically experienced by the segment?",
      "answer": "The Theme Parks segment revenue increased in 2023 due to higher guest spending at international parks that had previously faced restrictions during the pandemic, as well as the opening of Super Nintendo World at the Hollywood park. This growth aligns with the segment\u2019s typical seasonal patterns, where attendance and revenue are influenced by vacation travel seasons, weather, and new attraction openings. However, the 2023 growth also reflects recovery from prior-year disruptions, suggesting that while seasonal trends remained a factor, the segment benefited from pent-up demand and new experiences driving attendance beyond typical seasonal expectations.",

      "question": "How does the increase in compensation expenses, which contributed $3.5 billion to R&D growth, impact Google Cloud's operating loss trajectory, especially considering the company's strategic emphasis on expanding non-advertising revenue through services like Google Cloud?",
      "answer": "The $3.5 billion increase in compensation expenses, which was a major contributor to the $4.0 billion overall increase in R&D expenses from 2020 to 2021, directly affected Google Cloud's operating performance. According to the segment reporting, Google Cloud's operating loss decreased by $2.5 billion year-over-year, primarily driven by revenue growth but partially offset by higher compensation expenses. This aligns with the broader corporate strategy outlined in the business overview, where Google emphasizes expanding non-advertising revenue through services like Google Cloud, despite the associated cost pressures from talent investment. The strategic push to grow Google Cloud appears to be coupled with rising personnel costs, which are tempering margin expansion even as the segment's top line improves.",

While we have a foreign exchange risk management program designed to reduce our exposure to these fluctuations, this program does not fully offset their effect on our revenues and earnings.\n\n## \u00b7 The portion of revenues that we derive from non-advertising revenues is increasing and may adversely affect margins.\n\nNon-advertising revenues have grown over time. We expect this trend to continue as we focus on expanding our offerings through products and services like Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware products, and YouTube subscriptions. We currently derive non-advertising revenues primarily from sales of apps and in-app purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees, including fees received for Google Cloud services and subscription and other services. A number of Other Bets initiatives are in their initial development stages, and as such, revenues from these businesses could be volatile.  In  addition,  the  margins  on  these  revenues  vary  significantly  and  may  be  lower  than  the margins on our advertising revenues.\n\n## \u00b7 As we continue to serve our users and expand our businesses, we will invest heavily in operating and capital expenditures.\n\nWe continue to make significant R&amp;D investments in areas of strategic focus across Google Services, Google Cloud and Other Bets. We also expect to continue to invest in land and buildings for data centers and offices, and information technology assets, which includes servers and network equipment, to support the long-term growth of our business. In addition, acquisitions and strategic investments contribute to the breadth and depth of our offerings, expand our expertise in  engineering  and  other  functional  areas,  and  build  strong  partnerships  around  strategic  initiatives.  For  example,  in January 2021 we closed the acquisition of Fitbit, Inc. for $2.1 billion, which is expected to help spur innovation in wearable devices.\n\n## \u00b7 We face continuing changes in regulatory conditions, laws, and public policies, which could affect our business practices and financial results.\n\nChanges in social, political, economic, tax, and regulatory conditions or in laws and policies governing a wide range of topics and related legal matters have resulted in fines and caused us to change our business practices. As these global trends continue, our cost of doing business may increase, and our ability to pursue certain business models or offer certain products or services may be limited. Examples include the antitrust complaints filed by the U.S. Department of Justice and a  number  of  state Attorneys  General,  the  Digital  Markets Act  in  Europe,  and  various  legislative  proposals  in  the  U.S. focused on large technology platforms.\n\n## \u00b7 Our employees are critical to our success and we expect to continue investing in them.\n\nOur employees are among our best assets and are critical for our continued success. We expect to continue hiring talented employees around the globe and to provide competitive compensation programs. For additional information see Culture and Workforce in Part I, Item 1 'Business.'\n\n## Seasonality and other\n\nOur  advertising  revenues  are  affected  by  seasonal  fluctuations  in  internet  usage,  advertising  expenditures,  and underlying  business  trends,  such  as  traditional  retail  seasonality.  Additionally,  our  non-advertising  revenues,  including those  generated  from  Google  Cloud,  Google  Play,  hardware,  and  YouTube,  may  be  affected  by  fluctuations  driven  by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\n\n## Revenues and Monetization Metrics\n\n## Google Services\n\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising ('Google advertising') as well as revenues from other sources ('Google other revenues').\n\n## Google Advertising\n\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\n\n- Google Search &amp; other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and Google Play;\n- YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and",

Since the consumer products business is closely tied to guest spending at theme parks, this downturn likely reduced merchandise sales, which are a key revenue driver for that business.

We also produce television content jointly as co-producers with third-party studios and production companies. Our television studios produce content primarily under the following names:\n\n- Universal Television\n- Universal Content Productions\n- Universal Television Alternative Studio\n- Universal International Studios\n- Sky Studios\n\nOur original content is primarily initially licensed to linear television networks and DTC streaming service providers, including those in our Media and Residential Connectivity &amp; Platforms segments. We also license content after its initial airing, license older television content from our television library, and distribute owned and acquired content globally through the sale of physical and digital home entertainment products.  The production and distribution costs related to original broadcast television content generally exceed the revenue generated from the initial license, which means that obtaining additional licenses following the initial network license is critical to the content's financial success. Similar to our film studios, we typically owe residuals and participations payments in connection with television studio productions.\n\n## Theme Parks Segment\n\nOur Theme Parks segment primarily includes the operations of the following Universal theme parks:\n\n- Universal Orlando Resort : Includes two theme parks, Universal Studios Florida and Islands of Adventure, and our water park, V olcano Bay, all of which are located in Orlando, Florida. Universal Orlando Resort also includes Universal CityWalk Orlando, a dining, retail and entertainment complex, and features onsite themed hotels in which we own a noncontrolling interest, and will include an additional theme park, Epic Universe, that is expected to open in May 2025.\n- Universal Studios Hollywood : Includes the Universal Studios Hollywood theme park located in Hollywood, California and Universal CityWalk Hollywood, a dining, retail and entertainment complex.\n- Universal Studios Japan : Includes the Universal Studios Japan theme park located in Osaka, Japan.\n- Universal  Beijing  Resort :  Includes  the  Universal  Studios  Beijing  theme  park,  as  well  as  Universal  CityWalk  Beijing,  a  dining,  retail  and  entertainment complex, and on-site themed hotels, all of which are located in Beijing, China. Universal Beijing Resort is owned by us and a consortium of Chinese stateowned companies (see Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K).\n\nOur Theme Parks segment properties are primarily owned by us, although certain properties are leased, including land in Beijing, China and Osaka, Japan. We have invested and will continue to invest significantly in ex isting and new theme park attractions, hotels and infrastructure, as well as in new destinations and ex periences, such as Epic Universe; Universal Kids Resort, a smaller-scale theme park in Frisco, Texas expected to open in 2026; and Universal Horror Unleashed, a year-round horror entertainment experience in Las Vegas, Nevada expected to open in 2025.\n\nRevenue is generated primarily from guest spending at our theme parks, including ticket sales and in-park spending on food, beverages and merchandise, and from our consumer products business. Revenue for our theme parks generally depends on the overall environment for travel and tourism, including consumer spending on leisure and other recreational activities.\n\nWe also license the right to use the Universal Studios brand name and other intellectual property and provide other services to third parties, including the party that owns and operates the Universal Studios Singapore theme park on Sentosa Island, Singapore. The themed elements in our rides, attractions, and merchandising are based on intellectual property in our Studios and Media segments and intellectual property licensed from third parties under long-term agreements.\n\n## Competition\n\n## Media\n\nOur  Media  segment  competes  for  viewers'  attention  and  audience  share  with  all  forms  of  programming  provided  to  viewers,  including  DTC  streaming  service providers; television networks; local broadcast television stations; physical and digital home entertainment products; video on demand and pay-per-view services; online activities, such as social networking and viewing user-generated content; gaming products; and other forms of entertainment, news and information.\n\nComcast 2024 Annual Report on Form 10-K",

      "answer": "The Latin America segment generated $2,162 million in wireless service revenue in 2024, yet it contributed only $40 million to the total segment operating income. This is in stark contrast to the Communications segment, which generated $27,095 million in operating income despite including similar service lines such as wireless and business wireline services. The significant disparity arises because the Latin America segment operates with much lower margins, likely due to higher operating costs, regulatory challenges, or competitive pressures in the Mexican market. Additionally, the Latin America segment accounts for less than 1% of total segment operating income, indicating that while it generates a notable amount of revenue, its profitability is limited compared to the broader Communications segment, which benefits from scale, integrated operations, and more favorable market conditions in the U.S.",

      "answer": "The Business Wireline segment experienced a 7.3% decline in operating revenues, falling from $22,538 million in 2022 to $20,883 million in 2023, reflecting ongoing pressures in traditional enterprise services. In contrast, the Latin America segment contributed $2,162 million in wireless service revenues in 2023, representing a small but targeted growth area. Given that the Communications segment (which includes Business Wireline) accounts for 97% of total segment operating revenues, while Latin America contributes just 3%, the company appears to be prioritizing stabilization and efficiency in its core domestic operations over aggressive expansion in its Latin American wireless business.

Operating expenses consist primarily of programming and production costs, technology support costs, operating labor and distribution costs. Programming and production costs include amortization of licensed sports rights and production costs related to live sports and other sports-related programming.\n\n## Experiences\n\nThe Experiences segment primarily generates revenue from the sale of admissions to theme parks, the sale of food, beverage and merchandise at our theme parks and resorts, charges for room nights at hotels, sales of cruise vacations, sales and rentals of vacation club properties, royalties from licensing our IP for use on consumer goods and the sale of branded merchandise. Revenues are also generated from sponsorships and co-branding opportunities, real estate rent and sales, and royalties from Tokyo Disney Resort.

      "answer": "The tax incentives disclosed on page 51 reduced content amortization by $899 million in 2024, $835 million in 2023, and $719 million in 2022, directly lowering the cost basis of content assets and decreasing amortization expenses over time. This reduction in expenses flows into the income statement on page 66, where content amortization is a major cost component. Over the three-year period, content amortization increased from $14.03 billion to $15.30 billion, but without the tax incentives, this increase would have been significantly higher, likely compressing the operating margin, which rose from 18% in 2022 to 27% in 2024. Therefore, the multi-year amortization savings from tax incentives meaningfully contributed to Netflix's improving operating margin trend by reducing a key cost driver.",

Since tax incentives lower the cost basis of content assets, they reduce the total amortization expense recognized over time. This adjustment introduces an additional variable into the estimation process, which is already complex due to the reliance on historical and forecasted viewing data. As a result, any changes in the assumptions around future viewing or the availability of tax incentives could significantly alter the amortization schedule and financial performance, making the sensitivity analyses even more critical.",

The Company amortizes Content based on factors including historical and estimated viewing patterns. Auditing the amortization of the Company's Content is complexand subjective due to the judgmental nature of amortization which is based on an estimate of future viewing patterns. Estimated viewing patterns are based on historical and forecasted viewing. If actual viewing patterns differ fromthese estimates, the pattern and/or period of amortization would be changed and could affect the timing of recognition of content amortization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |\n| How We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit                                | Weobtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the content amortization process. For example, we tested controls over management's review of the content amortization method and the significant assumptions, including the historical and forecasted viewing hour consumption, used to develop estimated viewing patterns. Wealso tested management's controls to determine that the data used in the model was complete and accurate. To test content amortization, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the content amortization method, testing the significant assumptions used to develop the estimated viewing patterns and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data. For example, we assessed management's assumptions by comparing themto current viewing trends and current operating information including comparing previous estimates of viewing patterns to actual results. Wealso performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the potential changes in the content amortization recorded that could result fromchanges in the assumptions. |\n| /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012. | /s/ Ernst &Young LLP Wehave served as the Company's auditor since 2012.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

      "question": "How does the significant decline in Business Wireline Segment Operating Income from $3,092M in 2021 to $1,289M in 2023 relate to the nonrecurring fair value measurements and impairment indicators for the Business Wireline reporting unit, and what impact does this have on AT&T's overall Operating Income reconciliation?",
      "answer": "The Business Wireline segment experienced a significant decline in Segment Operating Income, falling from $3,092M in 2021 to $2,290M in 2022 and further to $1,289M in 2023, representing a 43.7% drop year-over-year. This performance contributed to impairment indicators that triggered nonrecurring fair value measurements for the Business Wireline reporting unit, as disclosed in the fair value measurement note on page 76. These impairment indicators and any resulting charges would then flow into the reconciliation of Segment Operating Income to AT&T's overall Operating Income (which declined from $25,783M in 2021 to $27,660M in 2023), particularly through the 'Asset impairments and abandonments and restructuring' line item, which totaled $1,193M in 2023. This demonstrates how underperformance in a specific segment can trigger valuation adjustments that directly affect consolidated financial results.",

      "answer": "Rising content acquisition costs, disclosed as part of the cost of revenues on page 56, directly contributed to margin pressure on Google Services, as noted on page 39, where the segment's operating income growth was partially offset by increases in these costs. This financial strain occurs alongside significant strategic investments in hardware (e.g., Pixel phones, Nest devices) and heightened competitive pressures in markets like mobile and consumer electronics, as described on page 12. These combined factors challenge Google Services' ability to maintain robust operating income growth, despite revenue expansion, due to rising fixed and variable costs associated with content licensing and aggressive investment in innovation to remain competitive.",

Revenues  related  to  cloud  services  provided  on  a  consumption  basis  are  recognized  when  the customer utilizes the services, based on the quantity of services consumed. Revenues related to cloud services provided on a subscription basis are recognized ratably over the contract term as the customer receives and consumes the benefits of the cloud services.\n\n## Google Other Revenues\n\nGoogle other revenues consist of revenues from:\n\n- Google Play, which includes sales of apps and in-app purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play store;\n- hardware, which includes sales of Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest home products, and Pixel phones;\n- YouTube non-advertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\n- other products and services.\n\nAs it relates to Google other revenues, the most significant judgment is determining whether we are the principal or agent for app sales and in-app purchases through the Google Play store. We report revenues from these transactions on a net  basis  because  our  performance  obligation  is  to  facilitate  a  transaction  between  app  developers  and  end  users,  for which we earn a service fee.\n\n## Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\n\nOur  contracts  with  customers  may  include  multiple  performance  obligations.  For  such  arrangements,  we  allocate revenues to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price. We generally determine standalone selling prices based on the prices charged to customers or using expected cost plus margin.\n\n## Customer Incentives and Credits\n\nCertain customers receive cash-based incentives or credits, which are accounted for as variable consideration. We estimate these amounts based on the expected amount to be provided to customers and reduce revenues. We believe that there will not be significant changes to our estimates of variable consideration.\n\n## Sales Commissions\n\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred and when the amortization period (the period of the expected benefit) is one year or less. We recognize an asset for certain sales commissions if we expect the period of benefit of these costs to exceed one year and recognize the expense over the amortization period. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses.\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of revenues consists of TAC and other costs of revenues.\n\n- TAC includes:\n- Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution  partners  include  browser  providers,  mobile  carriers,  original  equipment  manufacturers,  and software developers.\n- Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\n- Other cost of revenues includes:\n- Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).",

The  increase  was  due  to  growth  in revenues  partially  offset  by  increases  in  TAC,  content  acquisition  costs,  compensation  expenses,  advertising  and promotional expenses, and charges related to certain legal matters. The increase in expenses was partially offset by a reduction in costs driven by the change in the estimated useful life of our servers and certain network equipment. The effect of COVID-19 on 2020 results affected the year-over-year increase in operating income.\n\n## Google Cloud\n\nGoogle Cloud operating loss decreased $2.5 billion from 2020 to 2021. The decrease in operating loss was primarily driven by growth in revenues, partially offset by an increase in expenses, primarily driven by compensation expenses.

The investments  that  we  are  making  across  Google  Services,  Google  Cloud,  and  Other  Bets  reflect  our  ongoing  efforts  to innovate  and  provide  products  and  services  that  are  useful  to  users,  advertisers,  publishers,  customers,  and  content providers. Our investments in Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets span a wide range of industries beyond online advertising. Such investments ultimately may not be commercially viable or may not result in an adequate return of capital  and,  in  pursuing  new  strategies,  we  may  incur  unanticipated  liabilities. These  endeavors  may  involve  significant risks  and  uncertainties,  including  diversion  of  resources  and  management  attention  from  current  operations  and,  with respect  to  Other  Bets,  the  use  of  alternative  investment,  governance,  or  compensation  structures  that  may  fail  to adequately align incentives across the company or otherwise accomplish their objectives.\n\nWithin Google Services, we continue to invest heavily in hardware, including our smartphones, home devices, and wearables, which is a highly competitive market with frequent introduction of new products and services, rapid adoption of technological advancements by competitors, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in  product  price  and  performance  characteristics,  and  price  and  feature  sensitivity  on  the  part  of  consumers  and businesses. There can be no assurance we will be able to provide hardware that competes effectively.\n\nWithin  Google  Cloud,  we  devote  significant  resources  to  develop  and  deploy  our  enterprise-ready  cloud  services, including Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace. We are incurring costs to build and maintain infrastructure to support cloud computing services and hire talent, particularly to support and scale our salesforce. At the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services. Pricing and delivery models are competitive and evolving, and we may not attain sufficient scale and profitability to achieve our business objectives.\n\nWithin  Other  Bets,  we  are  investing  significantly  in  the  areas  of  health,  life  sciences,  and  transportation,  among others. These investment areas face intense competition from large, experienced, and well-funded competitors and our offerings may not be able to compete effectively or to operate at sufficient levels of profitability.\n\nIn addition, new and evolving products and services, including those that use AI and machine learning, raise ethical, technological, legal, regulatory, and other challenges, which may negatively affect our brands and demand for our products and services. Because all of these new ventures are inherently risky, no assurance can be given that such strategies and offerings will be successful and will not harm our reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\n\n## Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and we anticipate downward pressure on our operating margin in the future.\n\nOur revenue growth rate could decline over time as a result of a number of factors, including increasing competition. Changes  in  device  mix,  geographic  mix,  ongoing  product  and  policy  changes,  product  mix,  and  property  mix  and  an increasing  competition  for  advertising  may  also  affect  our  advertising  revenue  growth  rate.  We  may  also  experience  a decline in our revenue growth rate as our revenues increase to higher levels, if there is a decrease in the rate of adoption of our products, services, and technologies, or due to deceleration or decline in demand for devices used to access our services, among other factors.\n\nIn addition, we may also experience downward pressure on our operating margin resulting from a variety of factors, such  as  the  continued  expansion  of  our  business  into  new  fields,  including  products  and  services  such  as  hardware, Google Cloud, and subscription products, as well as significant investments in Other Bets, all of which may have margins lower than those we generate from advertising. We may also experience downward pressure on our operating margins from increasing regulations, increasing competition, and increased costs for many aspects of our business. Due to these factors and the evolving nature of our business, our historical revenue growth rate and historical operating margin may not be indicative of our future performance. For additional information, see Trends in Our Business and Financial Effect in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\n## Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products, services, and brands as well as affect our ability to compete.\n\nOur patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for us. Various events outside of our control pose a threat to our intellectual property rights, as well as to our products, services, and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products and services are distributed or made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Although we seek to obtain patent protection for our innovations, it is possible  we  may  not  be  able  to  protect  some  of  these  innovations.  Moreover,  we  may  not  have  adequate  patent  or copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out to be important. There is always the possibility that the scope of the protection gained will be insufficient or that an issued patent may be deemed invalid or unenforceable.",

      "answer": "The $93 million net actuarial loss included in AOCI on page 102 reflects the unrealized loss related to postretirement medical plans as of the balance sheet date. This contrasts with the $595 million actuarial gain reported on page 101, which captures the change in the projected benefit obligation during the year due to assumption updates and market experience. The difference highlights that the AOCI amount represents cumulative, unamortized actuarial losses, while the actuarial gain in the obligations section reflects a reduction in the liability due to updated assumptions or demographic experience. This indicates a timing and methodological distinction in how actuarial impacts are recognized across financial statement sections, with AOCI capturing unrealized losses and the obligations section reflecting realized actuarial gains affecting the current year liability.",

This aligns with the explanation that these costs rose in 2024 due to increases in marketing and promotion expenses, among other factors.

      "answer": "Disney has explicitly stated its intention to increase investment in the Experiences segment as part of its broader business plan amid economic uncertainty (page_20). This strategic direction is directly linked to the Experiences segment's operational structure, which incurs substantial infrastructure costs such as technology support, utilities, property taxes, and transportation (page_38). These costs are further amplified by the capital-intensive nature of recent and ongoing projects at Walt Disney World Resort, including the transformation of EPCOT completed in June 2024 and the planned 2027 retheming of DinoLand USA into Tropical Americas (page_12). Therefore, while Disney is doubling down on Experiences as a growth lever, the associated infrastructure costs and capital investments reveal a high fixed cost base that could magnify financial risk if economic conditions deteriorate or fail to improve as anticipated.",

While a number of different factors affect the demand for our products and services, actual or perceived economic conditions could contribute to lower attendance or spending at our parks and experiences businesses, prices that MVPDs pay for our cable programming, purchases of and prices for advertising on our DTC products and linear platforms, subscription levels for our cable programming or DTC platforms or licensing fees, while also continuing to increase the prices we pay for goods, services and labor. Even if inflationary pressures moderate, we expect certain costs, such as for labor, to remain elevated. In addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and ex periences we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs, including borrowing costs as a result of elevated interest rates, making it more difficult to obtain financing for our operations and investments on favorable terms. A decline in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated could impact implementation or success of our business plans, such as our plans to increase investment in our Experiences segment, the realignment of our cost structure and plans for our DTC ad-supported services, enhancements, pricing structure and price increases. Unfavorable economic conditions also impair the ability of those with whom we do business to satisfy their obligations to us. The adverse impact on our businesses of actual or perceived declines in economic conditions or a failure of conditions to improve as anticipated will depend, in part, on their severity and duration and our ability to mitigate these impacts on our businesses is limited.\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses.\n\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar impact our revenues and the profitability of our businesses, including by impacting the cost in U.S. dollars of providing our goods and services, our revenues in U.S. dollars generated by our international businesses and the international demand for our domestic products and services. The current or continued strength in the value of the U.S. dollar adversely impacts the U.S. dollar value of revenue we receive and expect to receive from other markets and contributes to reduced international demand for our domestic products and services, including international travel to our domestic parks and resorts. A decrease in the value of the U.S. dollar often increases the cost of labor, goods and services in, or originating from, non-U.S. markets. Although we hedge exposure to fluctuations in certain foreign currencies, any such hedging activity may not substantially offset the negative financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations and is not expected to offset all such negative financial impact, particularly in periods of sustained U.S. dollar strength relative to multiple foreign currencies. Further, economic or political conditions in certain countries outside the U.S. also have reduced, and could continue to reduce, our ability to hedge exposure to currency fluctuations in those countries or our ability to repatriate revenue from those countries.\n\n## Changes in technology, in consumer consumption patterns and in how entertainment products are created affect demand for our entertainment products, the revenue we can generate from these products and the cost of producing or distributing these products.\n\nThe media entertainment and technology businesses in which we participate increasingly depend on our ability to successfully adapt to new technologies including shifting patterns of content consumption and how entertainment products are generated. New technologies affect the demand for our products, the manner in which our products are distributed to consumers, the ways we charge for and receive revenue for our entertainment products and the stability of those revenue streams, the sources and nature of competing content offerings, the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired audiences. These developments have impacted the business model for certain traditional forms of distribution, as evidenced by the industry-wide decline in ratings for broadcast and cable television, the reduction in demand for home entertainment sales of theatrical content, the development of alternative distribution channels for broadcast and cable programming and declines in subscriber levels for traditional cable channels. These developments have decreased advertising and affiliate revenue at some of our linear networks and have led, and may lead in the future, to the impairment of the value of certain of our assets. In addition, theater-going to watch movies has remained below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nRules governing new technological developments, such as developments in artificial intelligence (AI), including generative AI and large language model tools, remain unsettled, and these developments may affect aspects of our existing business model, including revenue streams for the use of our IP, how we create our entertainment products and the competition we face. In order to respond to the impact of new technologies on our businesses, we regularly consider, and from time to time implement new initiatives and changes to our business models, including by developing, investing in and acquiring DTC products, reorganizing our media and entertainment businesses to advance our DTC strategies and developing new media offerings. There can be no assurance that our DTC offerings, new media offerings and other efforts will successfully respond to technological changes. In addition, declines in certain traditional forms of distribution impacts the cost of content allocable to our DTC offerings, negatively impacting the profitability of our DTC offerings. As part of our DTC strategy, we forgo certain revenue from certain traditional sources as we invest in our DTC offerings. Since launch, our DTC streaming services experienced significant losses. There can be no assurance that the DTC model and other business models we may develop will each be or remain profitable or be as profitable over the long term as our historic business models.",

      "question": "Given the Communications Segment's dominance in generating nearly all of T's segment operating income in 2024, how does the decline in its operating income margin from 23.6% in 2023 to 23.0% in 2024 reconcile with the company's overall operating income decrease from $27,660 million in 2023 to $27,135 million in 2024?",
      "answer": "The Communications Segment, which contributes nearly all of T's segment operating income, saw its operating income margin decline from 23.6% in 2023 to 23.0% in 2024. This margin contraction aligns with the overall drop in T's total segment operating income from $27,660 million in 2023 to $27,135 million in 2024. Despite the Communications Segment still generating $27,095 million in operating income in 2024, the margin decline indicates reduced profitability relative to revenue, contributing to the overall decrease in segment operating income. This synthesis reveals that the company's core profitability pressures within its dominant segment are directly influencing the consolidated segment operating income trend.",

The segment's loss exceeds its contribution to total operating income, suggesting it was a key contributor to the overall decline.
