      "question": "How does AMT's inclusion of integration costs in its operating expenses reconcile with the exclusion of these costs in the pro forma financial results for the 2021 acquisitions?",
      "answer": "AMT reported integration costs as part of its operating expenses in the financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021, specifically citing an increase in other operating expenses due to acquisition-related costs associated with the Telxius and CoreSite Acquisitions. However, in the pro forma consolidated results, which reflect how the 2021 acquisitions would have impacted financials if completed earlier, these integration costs and anticipated cost synergies are explicitly excluded. This creates a contrast where actual results include integration expenses, which may depress short-term profitability, while the pro forma view assumes a smoother financial integration without these costs, potentially presenting a more optimistic long-term outlook.",

        "Hop 1: AMT(page_43) \u2192 Integration Costs: AMT includes integration costs in operating expenses, specifically citing a rise in other operating expenses due to acquisitions like Telxius and CoreSite.",

The prior year period also included $63.3 million of previously deferred interest associated with a shareholder loan. The growth in AFFO attributable to American Tower Corporation common stockholders was also impacted by higher adjustments for unconsolidated affiliates and noncontrolling interests in Europe.",

We expand or redevelop properties to enhance profitability and market share of existing assets when we believe the investment of our capital meets our risk-reward  criteria.  We  selectively  develop  new  properties  in  markets  we  believe  are  not  adequately  served  by existing retail outlet properties.\n\nWe routinely review and evaluate acquisition opportunities based on their ability to enhance our portfolio. Our international  strategy  includes  partnering  with  established  real  estate  companies  and  financing  international investments with local currency to minimize foreign exchange risk.\n\nTo support our growth, we employ a three-fold capital strategy:\n\n- provide the capital necessary to fund growth,\n- maintain sufficient flexibility to access capital in many forms, both public and private, and\n- manage our overall financial structure in a fashion that preserves our investment grade credit ratings.\n\nWe  consider  FFO,  net  operating  income,  or  NOI,  and  portfolio  NOI  to  be  key  measures  of  operating performance that  are  not  specifically  defined  by  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States,  or GAAP. We use these measures internally to evaluate the operating performance of our portfolio and provide a basis for comparison with other real estate companies. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measure are included below in this discussion.\n\n## COVID-19\n\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus, or COVID-19, a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. The COVID-19 pandemic has had a material negative impact on economic and market conditions around the world, and, notwithstanding the fact that vaccines are being administered in the United States and elsewhere, the pandemic continues to adversely impact economic activity in retail real estate. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and governments and  other  authorities,  including  where  we  own  or  hold  interests  in  properties,  have  imposed  at  times  measures intended  to  control  its  spread,  including  restrictions  on  freedom  of  movement,  group  gatherings  and  business operations  such  as  travel  bans,  border  closings,  business  closures,  quarantines,  stay-at-home,  shelter-in-place orders, capacity limitations and social distancing measures. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and these periodic measures, the Company has experienced material impacts including changes in the ability to recognize revenue due to  changes in our assessment of the probability of collection of lease income and asset impairment charges as a result of changing cash flows generated by our properties and investments.  Due to certain restrictive governmental orders placed on us, our domestic portfolio lost approximately 13,500 shopping days in 2020, the majority of which occurred in the second quarter.\n\nAs we developed and implemented our response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and restrictions intended  to  prevent  its  spread  on  our  business,  our  primary  focus  has  been  on  the  health  and  safety  of  our employees, our shoppers and the communities in which we serve.  In the second quarter of 2020, in connection with the  property  closures,  we  implemented  a  series  of  actions  to  reduce  costs  and  increase  liquidity  in  light  of  the economic impacts of the pandemic, including:\n\n- significantly reduced all non-essential corporate spending,\n- significantly reduced property operating expenses, including discretionary marketing spend,\n- implemented  a  temporary  furlough  of  certain  corporate  and  field  employees  due  to  the  closure  of  the Company's U.S. properties as a result of restrictive governmental orders; reduced certain corporate and field personnel and implemented a temporary freeze on company hiring efforts, and\n- suspended more than $1.0 billion of redevelopment and new development projects.",

      "question": "How does the $1.2 billion loss on the sale of ATC TIPL, recorded as part of the loss from discontinued operations, reflect both the impairment charges of $68.6 million noted earlier in the financial statements and the strategic decision to exit the India market?",
      "answer": "The $1.2 billion loss on the sale of ATC TIPL, which is included in the loss from discontinued operations, reflects both the earlier impairment charges and the broader strategic decision to exit the India market. Earlier in the financial statements, a $68.6 million asset impairment charge was recorded in 2024 for long-lived assets held and used, which included assets related to discontinued operations. This impairment charge likely reflects a partial write-down of the ATC TIPL assets prior to the sale, contributing to the overall loss. Additionally, the $1.1 billion portion of the loss attributed to the reclassification of cumulative translation adjustments indicates the financial impact of exiting the Indian market entirely. Thus, the loss on sale encapsulates both the direct impairment costs and the strategic financial consequences of divesting a major international operation.",

      "question": "How does the $1.2 billion loss on the sale of ATC TIPL reflect the reclassification of the $1.1 billion cumulative translation adjustment, and what does this imply about the financial impact of exiting the India market on AMT's consolidated operations?",
      "answer": "The $1.2 billion loss on the sale of ATC TIPL primarily resulted from the reclassification of the $1.1 billion cumulative translation adjustment tied to AMT's India operations. This reclassification occurred as part of the company exiting the India market, and it was included in the 'Loss from discontinued operations, net of taxes' in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended December 31, 2024. The cumulative translation adjustment had previously been recorded in other comprehensive income and was reclassified upon the completion of the ATC TIPL Transaction. This implies that the exit from India had a significant non-operational financial impact through the loss of accumulated foreign currency translation gains, which were reversed upon disposal. The adjustment highlights the broader financial consequences of strategic portfolio realignment beyond just the transaction proceeds received.",

In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to the Company beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to the Company, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. In the second half of 2023, VIL began making payments in full of its monthly contractual obligations owed to the Company.\n\nThe Company considered these developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under its tenant leases when conducting its 2022 annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets in India. A probability weighted assessment was performed, incorporating current and expected industry and market conditions and trends and, as a result, the Company determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n- An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India.\n- The Company also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million.\n\n## Goodwill Impairments\n\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, as further discussed in note 1.\n\nThe Company concluded that a triggering event occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to its India reporting unit primarily due to indications of value received from third parties in connection with the Company's review of various strategic alternatives for its India operations, which concluded in the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined in note 22). As a result, the Company performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023, using, among other things, the information obtained from third parties to compare the estimated fair value of the India reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The result of the Company's interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023",

At year-end, 55,235,238 shares of Simon common stock were reserved for issuance upon exchange of Operating Partnership units, which could lead to dilution if limited partners exercise exchange rights.

      "answer": "SPG faces a significant tax risk if the IRS challenges the Operating Partnership's status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which could cause SPG to lose its REIT status and result in substantial tax liabilities. This risk is heightened because SPG's business is conducted almost entirely through the Operating Partnership, which is not subject to federal income tax but whose income flows through to SPG and other partners. At the same time, all of SPG\u2019s indebtedness is incurred at the Operating Partnership level, not at the SPG corporate level. This means that the Operating Partnership's financial structure directly affects SPG\u2019s consolidated financial position. As of December 31, 2021, this structure is reflected in the consolidated debt disclosures, where all liabilities are attributed to the Operating Partnership and its subsidiaries, reinforcing the operational and financial interdependence between the two entities despite their separate legal and equity classifications.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Simon' mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the 'Operating Partnership' mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to 'we,' 'us' and 'our' mean collectively  Simon,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  those  entities/subsidiaries  owned  or  controlled  by  Simon and/or the Operating Partnership.\n\nSimon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  remaining  12.6%  ownership  interest  owned  by  limited  partners.  As  the  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership,  Simon  consolidates  the  Operating  Partnership  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  and  Simon  has  no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\nWe believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and\n- creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances  by  Simon,  preferred  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership,  or  preferred  units,  the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference  between  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Simon  and  those  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership's financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by  limited  partners  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  Although  classified  differently,  total  equity  of  Simon  and  the Operating Partnership is the same.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Simon  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  this  report provides:\n\n- separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;",

      "answer": "The Data Centers segment contributed $68.1 million in revenue growth, which includes a $1.1 million decrease in straight-line revenue. Straight-line revenue adjustments are non-cash items that affect GAAP revenue but are typically excluded from AFFO calculations. Despite this $1.1 million reduction in straight-line revenue, the overall AFFO for the company was $4,778.3 million, indicating that the impact of the straight-line adjustment was minimal in the context of the company\u2019s broader cash-generating operations.

      "answer": "The reorganization of AMT's Africa & APAC property segment in Q4 2024, which consolidated the previously separate Asia-Pacific and Africa segments, reflects a broader strategic realignment of the company's international operations. This reorganization set the stage for the subsequent decision to divest South Africa Fiber, a subsidiary within the newly combined Africa & APAC segment, for approximately $132.7 million. The sale, finalized in early 2025, aligns with a potential refocusing of the Africa & APAC segment on core communications infrastructure rather than fiber assets. This strategic shift is further supported by the timing of the sale shortly after the segment consolidation, suggesting a deliberate effort to streamline operations and allocate capital more efficiently across the newly structured segments.",

BUSINE SS SE GMENTS\n\n## Property\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company's Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company's data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in seven segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\n\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure -The Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\n\nData Centers - The Company operates 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. The Company's Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the ex isting property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Africa &amp; APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest ex pense, G ain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (ex pense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company's definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') is the Company's chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments' operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management's compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor\n\n## AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)",

      "answer": "The planned divestiture of South Africa Fiber for approximately $132.7 million, disclosed in the subsequent events section, reflects a strategic move by AMT to streamline its Africa & APAC property segment, which was newly formed in late 2024 by combining the previously separate Africa and Asia-Pacific property segments. This reorganization indicates a shift toward consolidated regional management, and the sale of a fiber asset in South Africa suggests a refocusing on core communications site leasing rather than fiber infrastructure within that region. The Africa & APAC segment operates across multiple countries, including South Africa, and the removal of South Africa Fiber from this segment may signal a strategic realignment to focus on tower-based assets rather than fiber, which may have different capital intensity and growth dynamics.",

BUSINE SS SE GMENTS\n\n## Property\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to its organizational structure, the Company reviewed and changed its operating and reportable segments. The Company's Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, the Company now has six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than the Company's data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. The change in operating and reportable segments had no impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements for any periods. Historical financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K has been adjusted to reflect the change in reportable segments.\n\nPrior to the change in reportable segments in the fourth quarter of 2024, the Company reported its results in seven segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property, Asia-Pacific property, Africa property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services.\n\nCommunications Sites and Related Communications Infrastructure -The Company's primary business is leasing space on multitenant communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. The Company has historically reported these operations on a geographic basis.\n\nData Centers - The Company operates 29 data center facilities across ten markets in the United States. The Company's Data Centers segment relates to data center facilities and related assets that the Company owns and operates in the United States. The Data Centers segment offers different types of leased land and related services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than the ex isting property operating segment in the U.S. &amp; Canada.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company's property operations consisted of the following:\n\n- U.S. &amp; Canada: property operations in Canada and the United States;\n- Africa &amp; APAC: property operations in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, the Philippines, South Africa and Uganda;\n- Europe: property operations in France, Germany and Spain;\n- Latin America: property operations in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Mexico, Paraguay and Peru; and\n- Data Centers: data center property operations in the United States.\n\nServices -The Company's Services segment offers tower-related services in the United States, including AZP, structural and mount analyses, and construction management, which primarily support its site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on its communications sites. The Services segment is a strategic business unit that offers different services from, and requires different resources, skill sets and marketing strategies than, the property operating segments.\n\nThe accounting policies applied in compiling segment information below are similar to those described in note 1. Among other factors, in evaluating financial performance in each business segment, management uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit. The Company defines segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding Depreciation, amortization and accretion; Selling, general, administrative and development expense; and Other operating expenses. The Company defines segment operating profit as segment gross margin less Selling, general, administrative and development expense attributable to the segment, excluding stock-based compensation expense and corporate expenses. These measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before Interest income, Interest ex pense, G ain (loss) on retirement of long-term obligations, Other income (ex pense), Net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests and Income tax benefit (provision). The categories of expenses indicated above, such as depreciation, have been excluded from segment operating performance as they are not considered in the review of information or the evaluation of results by management. The Company's definition of segment operating profit aligns with the Company's definition of Adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA is widely used in the telecommunications real estate sector to measure operating performance as depreciation, amortization and accretion may vary significantly among companies depending upon accounting methods and useful lives, particularly where acquisitions and non-operating factors are involved.\n\nThe Company's chief operating decision maker (the 'CODM') is the Company's chief executive officer. The CODM uses segment gross margin and segment operating profit to evaluate the segments' operating performance, in making capital allocation decisions, and in establishing management's compensation. Additionally, the CODM uses these metrics to monitor\n\n## AMERICAN TOWER CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\n(Tabular amounts in millions, unless otherwise disclosed)",

      "question": "How does Simon Property Group's structural reliance on the Operating Partnership align with the treatment of Partners' Equity, particularly in light of the exchange rights that allow limited partners to convert units into Simon common stock or cash?",
      "answer": "Simon Property Group operates substantially all of its business through the Operating Partnership, in which it holds an approximate 86.5% ownership interest, with the remaining 13.5% owned by limited partners as Partners' Equity. This structural reliance on the Operating Partnership means that all major business activities\u2014such as entering into contracts, holding assets, and incurring debt\u2014occur at the partnership level. The financial statements of Simon and the Operating Partnership differ primarily in how equity is presented: Simon reports stockholders' equity, while the Operating Partnership reports partners' equity, which includes the 13.5% limited partner interest. Crucially, limited partners have the right to exchange their units for either Simon common stock on a one-for-one basis or cash, depending on the Board's discretion. If cash is selected, Simon must contribute cash to the Operating Partnership as partners' equity to fund the redemption. This mechanism creates a direct link between Simon\u2019s equity structure and the Operating Partnership\u2019s partners' equity, reinforcing the consolidated operational and financial alignment of the two entities while allowing flexibility in managing ownership transitions.",

W e  are  structured  as  an  um brella  partnership  R E I T   under  which  substantially  all  of  our  business  is  conducted  through  the Operating P artnership, Sim on's m ajority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Sim on is the general partner. As of D ecem ber 31, 2024,  Sim on  owned  an  approxim ate  86.5%  ownership  interest  in  the  O perating  P artnership,  with  the  rem aining  13.5%  ownership interest  owned  by  lim ited  partners. As  the  sole  general  partner  of  the  O perating  P artnership,  S im on  has  exclusive  control  of  the Operating P artnership's day-to-day m anagem ent.\n\nWe operate Sim on and the O perating P artnership as one business. T he m anagem ent of Sim on consists of the sam e m em bers as the m anagem ent of the O perating P artnership. As general partner with control of the O perating P artnership, Sim on consolidates the Operating P artnership for financial reporting purposes, and Sim on has no m aterial assets or liabilities other than its investm ent in the Operating P artnership. T herefore, the assets and liabilities of Sim on and the O perating P artnership are the sam e on their respective financial statem ents.\n\nWe believe  that  com bining  the  annual  reports  on  F orm   10-K  of  S im on  and  the  O perating  P artnership  into  this  single  report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Sim on and the O perating P artnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the sam e m anner as m anagem ent views and operates the business;\n- elim inates duplicative disclosure and provides a m ore stream lined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Sim on and the O perating P artnership; and\n- creates tim e and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one com bined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is im portant for investors to understand the few differences between Sim on and the O perating P artnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated com pany. T he prim ary difference is that Sim on itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the O perating P artnership and issuing equity or equity-related instrum ents from  tim e to tim e. I n addition, Sim on itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the O perating P artnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the O perating P artnership.\n\nThe Operating P artnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. T he O perating P artnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. E xcept for the net proceeds from  equity issuances by Sim on, which are contributed to the capital of the O perating P artnership in exchange for, in the case of com m on stock issuances by Sim on, com m on units of partnership interest in the O perating P artnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances by Sim on, preferred units of partnership interest in the O perating P artnership, or preferred units, the O perating P artnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from  the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the m ain areas of difference between the consolidated financial statem ents of Sim on and those of the O perating P artnership. T he differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from  differences in the equity issued at the Sim on and O perating P artnership levels. T he units held by lim ited partners in the O perating P artnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the O perating P artnership's financial statem ents and as noncontrolling interests in Sim on's financial statem ents. T he noncontrolling interests in the O perating P artnership's financial statem ents include  the  interests  of  unaffiliated  partners  in  various  consolidated  partnerships.  T he  noncontrolling  interests  in  S im on's  financial statem ents include the sam e noncontrolling interests at the O perating P artnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by lim ited partners of the O perating P artnership.

      "answer": "The decline in Partners' Equity from $3,586,600 million in 2022 to $3,470,328 million in 2023 reflects a reduction in the equity attributable to the Operating Partnership, which is closely tied to the structure and activities of the partnership. As the Operating Partnership allows limited partners to exchange units for Simon common stock or cash, this mechanism can directly affect the equity structure and value. The exchange rights, which involve Simon reserving 55,235,238 shares of common stock for potential issuance, suggest that equity dilution or cash outflows could be contributing factors to the observed decline.

      "answer": "Simon Property Group holds a 40% interest in ten joint venture properties in Japan, all of which are Premium Outlets totaling over 3.9 million square feet and are nearly fully leased (99.7%). These properties are part of SPG\u2019s international investments and are categorized under the broader Premium Outlets segment, which includes global operations. However, despite the scale and high occupancy of these Japanese assets, they contribute only a small fraction to SPG\u2019s overall asset and revenue base, with just 7.3% of long-lived assets and 4.2% of total revenues coming from non-U.S. locations as of December 31, 2023. This suggests that while SPG maintains a strong presence in Japan through joint ventures, its core business remains heavily U.S.-centric, and international operations\u2014including the Japanese Premium Outlets\u2014serve more as complementary rather than strategic growth engines at this time.",

      "question": "How does AMT's strategic ownership structure in ATC Europe, where it holds a 52% controlling interest, influence its dividend declaration practices for noncontrolling interests, particularly in light of the 13.2 million EUR dividend paid by Former ATC Europe in 2020?",
      "answer": "AMT's ownership in ATC Europe, where it holds a 52% controlling stake, directly affects its dividend declaration practices for noncontrolling interests. In 2020, the Former ATC Europe (before the reorganization) declared a dividend of 13.2 million EUR, which was distributed to AMT and PGGM in proportion to their equity interests. This demonstrates that AMT, despite its controlling interest, must account for and distribute returns to minority stakeholders in line with their proportional ownership. The dividend practices of ATC Europe and its subsidiaries are thus shaped by both AMT\u2019s strategic control and its obligation to noncontrolling investors like PGGM, CDPQ, and Allianz. This dynamic is essential for maintaining investor confidence and aligning with AMT\u2019s broader capital distribution strategy as a REIT, which includes regular dividend payments to common stockholders.",

          "chunk_text": "## ITEM 1. BUSINESS\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are one of the largest global real estate investment trusts and a leading independent owner, operator and developer of multitenant communications real estate. Our primary business is the leasing of space on communications sites to wireless service providers, radio and television broadcast companies, wireless data providers, government agencies and municipalities and tenants in a number of other industries. We refer to this business as our property operations, which accounted for 97% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. We also offer tower-related services in the United States, which we refer to as our services operations. These services include site application, zoning and permitting and structural analysis, which primarily support our site leasing business, including the addition of new tenants and equipment on our sites. Our customers include our tenants, licensees and other payers.\n\nSince inception, we have grown our communications real estate portfolio through acquisitions, long-term lease arrangements and site development. Our portfolio primarily consists of towers that we own and towers that we operate pursuant to long-term lease arrangements, as well as distributed antenna system ('DAS') networks, which provide seamless coverage solutions in certain inbuilding and outdoor wireless environments. In addition to the communications sites in our portfolio, we manage rooftop and tower sites for property owners under various contractual arrangements. We also hold other telecommunications infrastructure, fiber and property interests that we lease primarily to communications service providers and third-party tower operators, and, as discussed further below, we hold a portfolio of highly interconnected data center facilities and related assets in the United States that we lease primarily to enterprises, network operators, cloud providers and supporting service providers.\n\nIn 2021, we added approximately 31,000 communications sites to our portfolios in Latin America and Europe and launched operations in Spain as part of our transaction with Telxius Telecom, S.A. ('Telxius,' and the acquisition, the 'Telxius Acquisition,' as further discussed in Item 7 of this Annual Report under the caption 'Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Executive Overview'). In addition, we launched operations in the Philippines through the construction of new sites therein and in Bangladesh through the acquisition of a controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited (the 'Bangladesh Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our communications real estate portfolio of 220,131 communications sites included 43,308 communications sites in the U.S. &amp; Canada, 75,725 communications sites in AsiaPacific, 22,165 communications sites in Africa, 30,041 communications sites in Europe and 48,892 communications sites in Latin America, as well as urban telecommunications assets, including fiber, in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, India, Mexico and South Africa and other property interests in Australia, Canada and the United States.\n\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of CoreSite Realty Corporation ('CoreSite'), consisting of over 20 data center facilities and related assets in eight United States markets, for total consideration of $10.4 billion, including the assumption and repayment of CoreSite's existing debt (the 'CoreSite Acquisition'). As of December 31, 2021, our data center portfolio consisted of 27 data center facilities across ten United States markets, including the assets acquired as part of the CoreSite Acquisition, as well as our previously acquired data center facilities.\n\nIn May 2021 and June 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, we entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in subsidiaries whose holdings consist of our operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain (such subsidiaries collectively, 'ATC Europe,' and the transactions, the 'ATC Europe Transactions'). We completed the ATC Europe Transactions in September 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion Euros ('EUR') (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, we hold a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that generally offsets our REIT income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2021, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. indoor DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in\n\n## PART I",

The amount accrued for distributions payable related to unvested restricted stock units was $12.8 million and $12.6 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $7.5 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units. To maintain its qualification for taxation as a REIT, the Company expects to continue paying distributions, the amount, timing and frequency of which will be determined, and subject to adjustment, by the Company's Board of Directors.\n\n## 16.    NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n\nDividend to noncontrolling interest -Certain of the Company's subsidiaries may, from time to time, declare dividends. During the year ended December 31, 2021, AT Iberia C.V. declared a dividend of 14.0 million EUR (approximately $15.9 million) payable pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreements to ATC Europe and PGGM in proportion to their respective equity interests in AT Iberia C.V. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the subsidiary that primarily consisted of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Poland ('Former ATC Europe') declared a dividend of 13.2 million EUR (approximately $16.2 million as of December 31, 2020) payable in cash to the Company and PGGM in proportion to their respective equity interests in Former ATC Europe. The dividend was paid on January 6, 2021.\n\nPurchase of Interests -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased the remaining minority interests held in a subsidiary in the United States for total consideration of $6.0 million. The purchase price was settled with unregistered shares of the Company's common stock, in lieu of cash. The Company now owns 100% of the subsidiary as a result of the purchase.\n\nReorganization of European Interests -During the year ended December 31, 2021, in connection with the funding of the Telxius Acquisition, the Company completed a reorganization of its subsidiaries in Europe. As part of the reorganization, PGGM converted its previously held 49% noncontrolling interest in Former ATC Europe into noncontrolling interests in new subsidiaries, consisting of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, inclusive of the assets acquired pursuant to the Telxius Acquisition. The reorganization included cash consideration paid to PGGM of 178.0 million EUR (approximately $214.9 million). The reorganization is reflected in the consolidated statements of equity as (i) a reduction in Additional Paid-in Capital of $648.4 million and (ii) an increase in Noncontrolling Interests of $601.0 million, and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as an increase in Comprehensive income attributable to American Tower Corporation stockholders of $47.4 million.\n\nCDPQ and Allianz Partnerships -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe (the 'ATC Europe Transactions'). The Company completed the ATC Europe Transactions during the year ended December 31, 2021 for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing). After the completion of the ATC Europe Transactions, the Company holds a 52% controlling ownership interest in ATC Europe.\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, ATC Europe consists of the Company's operations in France, Germany, Poland and Spain. The Company currently holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, with CDPQ and Allianz holding 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively. ATC Europe holds a 100% interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in France and Poland and an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively, with PGGM holding a 13% and a 17% noncontrolling interest in each respective subsidiary.\n\nBangladesh Partnership -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in KTBL for 900 million BDT (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing).

The reorganization included cash consideration paid to PGGM of 178.0 million EUR (approximately $214.9 million). The reorganization is reflected in the consolidated statements of equity as (i) a reduction in Additional Paid-in Capital of $648.4 million and (ii) an increase in Noncontrolling Interests of $601.0 million, and in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (loss) as an increase in Comprehensive income attributable to American Tower Corporation stockholders of $47.4 million.\n\nCDPQ and Allianz Partnerships -During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company entered into agreements with Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz'), for CDPQ and Allianz to acquire 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe (the 'ATC Europe Transactions').

      "question": "How does the change in SPG's Deferred Costs and Other Assets from 2023 to 2024 relate to the portion of those assets categorized under Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1), and what does this imply about the company's asset valuation methodology and market exposure?",
      "answer": "SPG's Deferred Costs and Other Assets decreased from $537,943 million in 2023 to $531,059 million in 2024, a decline of $6,884 million. Of the 2024 Deferred Costs and Other Assets, $89,871 million were categorized under Quoted Prices in Active Markets (Level 1), indicating a portion of these assets is directly influenced by observable market data. In 2023, the Level 1 portion was $97,696 million, suggesting a shift in the composition or valuation of these assets. This implies that while a segment of Deferred Costs and Other Assets is tied to active market pricing, the overall decline in the total value of these assets may reflect either write-downs, reclassifications, or changes in unobservable inputs (Level 3), which could signal increased risk or reduced confidence in market-based valuations.",

      "answer": "AMT's Latin America property segment experienced $58.0 million in tenant billings growth, primarily driven by $35.3 million from colocations and amendments, which reflects the strategic importance of these activities in generating revenue. This aligns with the broader company focus on leveraging colocations and amendments as a key growth mechanism, as seen in the U.S. & Canada segment where $229.9 million of tenant billings growth was attributed to colocations and amendments. The Latin America expansion, which added 7,000 communications sites through the Telxius acquisition, provided the infrastructure necessary to support this growth in tenant activity. This demonstrates that AMT's acquisition strategy in Latin America was effectively translating into operational performance, despite challenges such as the $74.0 million decrease in other revenue due to the sale of Mexico Fiber and reduced tenant settlements.",

      "answer": "The SPG 10-K filing highlights a significant tax risk if the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, which would cause SPG to lose its REIT status and face adverse tax consequences. This risk is directly tied to the structure of the Operating Partnership, where SPG holds an 87.4% ownership interest as the general partner. The financial statements disclose that Partners' Equity includes $3,838,744 (as of December 31, 2021) composed of preferred units, general partner units, and limited partner units. A shift in the Operating Partnership's tax treatment would not only impact SPG\u2019s REIT status but also the value and tax implications for equity holders, including the $477,292 attributed to limited partners. Therefore, the financial structure and equity composition shown in Partners' Equity are inextricably linked to the tax risk outlined in the earlier section, emphasizing the importance of maintaining the Operating Partnership\u2019s partnership status to preserve the current equity framework and avoid significant tax liabilities.",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.

References to 'we,' 'us' and 'our' mean collectively  Simon,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  those  entities/subsidiaries  owned  or  controlled  by  Simon and/or the Operating Partnership.\n\nSimon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  remaining  12.6%  ownership  interest  owned  by  limited  partners.  As  the  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership,  Simon  consolidates  the  Operating  Partnership  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  and  Simon  has  no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\nWe believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and\n- creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances  by  Simon,  preferred  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership,  or  preferred  units,  the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference  between  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Simon  and  those  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership's financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by  limited  partners  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  Although  classified  differently,  total  equity  of  Simon  and  the Operating Partnership is the same.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Simon  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  this  report provides:\n\n- separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;",

      "answer": "Simon's obligation to fund cash exchanges for Operating Partnership units (up to 55,235,238 shares at December 31, 2023) directly ties to the Operating Partnership's exclusive role in incurring all company debt. Since Simon must contribute cash to the Partnership to redeem units for cash rather than stock, this potential liability could necessitate additional indebtedness by the Operating Partnership. This dynamic directly impacts the Partnership's consolidated debt presentation, which includes mortgages and unsecured indebtedness specifically disclosed on page 120, revealing how capital structure decisions affect both liquidity needs and leverage metrics.",

      "question": "Given the $36.4 million decline in pass-through revenue in the Europe property segment due to falling energy costs, how does AMT's continued expansion in Europe through the Telxius acquisition align with its operational performance in the region?",
      "answer": "AMT reported a $36.4 million decrease in pass-through revenue in the Europe property segment, primarily driven by lower energy costs. Despite this operational headwind, AMT expanded its European presence significantly through the Telxius acquisition, which added nearly 20,000 communications sites in Germany and Spain for approximately \u20ac6.3 billion (~$7.7 billion at closing). This indicates a strategic commitment to the European market, even as declining pass-through revenue from energy cost fluctuations pressured segment performance. The acquisition suggests confidence in the long-term stability and growth potential of the European telecom infrastructure market, despite short-term revenue volatility.",

      "question": "How does Simon's disclosure regarding the 86.5% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership reconcile with the potential dilution risk posed by the exchange rights for limited partners' units, given the 56 million shares reserved for issuance upon exchange?",
      "answer": "Simon discloses that as of December 31, 2024, it holds an 86.5% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership, with the remaining 13.5% held by limited partners. These limited partners have the right to exchange their units for Simon common stock on a one-for-one basis or cash, at Simon's discretion. Simon has reserved 56,002,333 shares of common stock for potential issuance upon the exercise of these exchange rights, among other instruments. If a significant number of limited partners elect to exchange their units for stock, Simon\u2019s ownership percentage in the Operating Partnership could decrease, leading to potential dilution of its control. However, Simon retains the option to settle in cash, which would require a corresponding contribution to the Operating Partnership as partners\u2019 equity. This dynamic illustrates a structural mechanism that could impact Simon\u2019s consolidated ownership and capital structure, despite its current majority stake.",

T he prim ary difference is that Sim on itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the O perating P artnership and issuing equity or equity-related instrum ents from  tim e to tim e.

If the Operating Partnership were to fail to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, SPG would likely lose its REIT status due to failure in gross income and asset tests. This would have cascading effects, including potential corporate-level taxation on the Operating Partnership\u2019s income, significantly reducing cash available for debt service and distributions. Therefore, the structure that centralizes indebtedness within the Operating Partnership, while operationally efficient, introduces a critical tax compliance risk that could jeopardize SPG\u2019s REIT status and financial stability.",

Unless stated otherwise or the context otherwise requires, references to 'Simon' mean Simon Property Group, Inc. and references to the 'Operating Partnership' mean Simon Property Group, L.P. References to 'we,' 'us' and 'our' mean collectively  Simon,  the  Operating  Partnership  and  those  entities/subsidiaries  owned  or  controlled  by  Simon and/or the Operating Partnership.\n\nSimon is a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code. We are structured as an umbrella partnership REIT under which substantially all of our business is conducted through the Operating Partnership, Simon's majority-owned partnership subsidiary, for which Simon is the general partner. As of December 31, 2021, Simon owned an approximate 87.4% ownership interest in the  Operating  Partnership,  with  the  remaining  12.6%  ownership  interest  owned  by  limited  partners.  As  the  sole general partner of the Operating Partnership, Simon has exclusive control of the Operating Partnership's day-to-day management.\n\nWe operate Simon and the Operating Partnership as one business. The management of Simon consists of the same members as the management of the Operating Partnership. As general partner with control of the Operating Partnership,  Simon  consolidates  the  Operating  Partnership  for  financial  reporting  purposes,  and  Simon  has  no material assets or liabilities other than its investment in the Operating Partnership. Therefore, the assets and liabilities of Simon and the Operating Partnership are the same on their respective financial statements.\n\nWe believe that combining the annual reports on Form 10-K of Simon and the Operating Partnership into this single report provides the following benefits:\n\n- enhances investors' understanding of Simon and the Operating Partnership by enabling investors to view the business as a whole in the same manner as management views and operates the business;\n- eliminates duplicative disclosure and provides a more streamlined presentation since substantially all of the disclosure in this report applies to both Simon and the Operating Partnership; and\n- creates time and cost efficiencies through the preparation of one combined report instead of two separate reports.\n\nWe believe it is important for investors to understand the few differences between Simon and the Operating Partnership in the context of how we operate as a consolidated company. The primary difference is that Simon itself does not conduct business, other than acting as the general partner of the Operating Partnership and issuing equity or equity-related instruments from time to time. In addition, Simon itself does not incur any indebtedness, as all debt is incurred by the Operating Partnership or entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by the Operating Partnership.\n\nThe Operating Partnership holds, directly or indirectly, substantially all of our assets, including our ownership interests in our joint ventures. The Operating Partnership conducts substantially all of our business and is structured as a partnership with no publicly traded equity. Except for the net proceeds from equity issuances by Simon, which are contributed to the capital of the Operating Partnership in exchange for, in the case of common stock issuances by Simon, common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, or units, or, in the case of preferred stock issuances  by  Simon,  preferred  units  of  partnership  interest  in  the  Operating  Partnership,  or  preferred  units,  the Operating Partnership, directly or indirectly, generates the capital required by our business through its operations, the incurrence of indebtedness, proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties and joint ventures and the issuance of units or preferred units to third parties.\n\nThe presentation of stockholders' equity, partners' equity and noncontrolling interests are the main areas of difference  between  the  consolidated  financial  statements  of  Simon  and  those  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  The differences between stockholders' equity and partners' equity result from differences in the equity issued at the Simon and Operating Partnership levels. The units held by limited partners in the Operating Partnership are accounted for as partners' equity in the Operating Partnership's financial statements and as noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements. The noncontrolling interests in the Operating Partnership's financial statements include the interests of unaffiliated partners in various consolidated partnerships. The noncontrolling interests in Simon's financial statements include the same noncontrolling interests at the Operating Partnership level and, as previously stated, the units held by  limited  partners  of  the  Operating  Partnership.  Although  classified  differently,  total  equity  of  Simon  and  the Operating Partnership is the same.\n\nTo  help  investors  understand  the  differences  between  Simon  and  the  Operating  Partnership,  this  report provides:\n\n- separate consolidated financial statements for Simon and the Operating Partnership;",

Should these laws or regulations change, the amount of taxes we pay may increase accordingly.\n\nIf the Operating Partnership fails to qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, we would cease to qualify as a REIT and suffer other adverse consequences.\n\nWe believe that the Operating Partnership is treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. As a partnership, the Operating Partnership is not subject to federal income tax on its income. Instead, each of its partners, including us, is allocated, and may be required to pay tax with respect to, such partner's share of its income. We cannot  assure  you  that  the  Internal  Revenue  Service,  or  the  IRS,  will  not  challenge  the  status  of  the  Operating Partnership  or  any  other  subsidiary  partnership  or  limited  liability  company  in  which  we  own  an  interest  as  a disregarded entity or partnership for federal income tax purposes, or that a court would not sustain such a challenge. If the IRS were successful in treating the Operating Partnership or any such other subsidiary as an entity taxable as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would fail to meet the gross income tests and certain of the asset tests  applicable  to  REITs  and,  accordingly,  we  would  likely  cease  to  qualify  as  a  REIT.  Also,  the  failure  of  the Operating Partnership or any subsidiary partnerships or limited liability company to qualify as a disregarded entity or partnership  for  applicable  income  tax  purposes  could  cause  it  to  become  subject  to  federal  and  state  corporate income tax, which would reduce significantly the amount of cash available for debt service and for distribution to its partners or members, including us.\n\nOur ownership of TRSs is subject to certain restrictions, and we will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if our transactions with our TRSs are not conducted on arm'slength terms.\n\nWe own securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries, or TRSs, and may acquire securities in additional TRSs in the future. A TRS is a corporation other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a TRS owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a TRS. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a TRS may generally engage in any business,  including  the  provision  of  customary  or  non-customary  services  to  tenants  of  its  parent  REIT. A  TRS  is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. In addition, a 100% excise tax will be imposed on certain transactions between a TRS and its parent REIT that are not conducted on an arm's length basis.\n\nA REIT's ownership of securities of a TRS is not subject to the 5% or 10% asset tests applicable to REITs. Not more  than  25%  of  the  value  of  Simon's  or  any  Subsidiary  REIT's  total  assets  may  be  represented  by  securities (including securities of TRSs), other than those securities includable in the 75% asset test, and not more than 20% of the value of our total assets or the assets of any Subsidiary REIT may be represented by securities of TRSs. We anticipate that the aggregate value of the stock and securities of any TRS and other nonqualifying assets that Simon or each such Subsidiary REIT owns will be less than 25% (or 20%, as applicable) of the value of Simon's or such subsidiary's total assets, and we will monitor the value of these investments to ensure compliance with applicable ownership limitations. In addition, we intend to structure transactions with any TRSs that we own to ensure that they are entered into on arm's length terms to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to comply with the above limitations or to avoid application of the 100% excise tax discussed above.\n\nDividends  payable  by  REITs  generally  do  not  qualify  for  the  reduced  tax  rates  available  for  some dividends, which may negatively affect the value of our shares.\n\nIncome  from  'qualified  dividends'  payable  to  U.S.  stockholders  that  are  individuals,  trusts  and  estates  are generally subject to tax at preferential rates, currently at a maximum federal rate of 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for the preferential tax rates applicable to qualified dividend income. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or the TCJA, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct  up  to  20%  of  the  ordinary  dividends  (e.g.,  dividends  not  designated  as  capital  gain  dividends  or  qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the shareholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals, trusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations  that  pay  dividends,  which  could  materially  and  adversely  affect  the  value  of  the  shares  of REITs, including the per share trading price of our common stock.\n\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in 'prohibited transactions' may limit our ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\n\nA  REIT's  net  income  from  prohibited  transactions  is  subject  to  a  100%  penalty  tax.  In  general,  prohibited transactions",

      "question": "How does the potential dilution from the exchange of Operating Partnership units into Simon common stock, as outlined in the partnership agreement, affect the reported Partners' Equity value in Simon Property Group's consolidated financial statements?",
      "answer": "The exchange rights of limited partners in the Operating Partnership allow for the conversion of 48,913,717 units into shares of Simon common stock on a one-for-one basis or for cash based on the stock price. If the cash option is selected, Simon must contribute cash to the Operating Partnership as Partners' Equity to fund the redemption. This mechanism directly impacts the Partners' Equity section of the financial statements, where the General Partner's interest (2,981,728 units) and Limited Partners' interest (447,494 units) are separately disclosed. The potential dilution or cash outflow could reduce Partners' Equity if cash is used, or maintain its value if shares are issued instead, depending on Simon\u2019s board decision and market conditions.",

      "answer": "The $25.8 million in contractual escalations contributing to the Europe property segment\u2019s $47.2 million tenant billing growth indicates that a significant portion of the revenue increase stems from structured, recurring revenue streams tied to the acquired Telxius assets in Germany and Spain. Since the Telxius acquisition added nearly 20,000 communications sites in Europe, and the Europe segment specifically highlights contractual escalations as a major driver of tenant billings, it suggests that the acquired assets were integrated into a framework that emphasizes predictable revenue growth through long-term tenant agreements with built-in escalation clauses. This aligns with AMT\u2019s strategy of acquiring portfolios with embedded contractual escalations, reinforcing the stability and recurring nature of the revenue base from these sites.",

      "answer": "The $47.2 million tenant billings growth in the Europe property segment, driven by contractual escalations, colocations, and newly acquired sites, reflects the operational benefits from AMT's strategic expansion through acquisitions like the Telxius transaction. Specifically, the nearly 20,000 communications sites acquired in Germany and Spain in mid-2021 contributed to the Europe segment's revenue growth, suggesting that the integration of these acquired assets is generating measurable increases in tenant activity and contractual revenue streams. This alignment indicates that AMT's acquisition-driven growth strategy in Europe is translating into tangible financial performance improvements in the region.",

      "answer": "The $36.4 million decline in pass-through revenue in the Europe Property Segment is primarily attributed to a decrease in energy costs, which directly aligns with AMT's disclosure that pass-through revenue in international markets is used to recover certain costs, including power and fuel expenses, from tenants. Despite the expansion from the Telxius Acquisition\u2014which added nearly 20,000 communications sites in Germany and Spain\u2014the reduction in energy costs resulted in lower pass-through charges to tenants. This illustrates that pass-through revenue is directly tied to cost fluctuations rather than operational scale, and therefore a decline in underlying costs leads to a corresponding decline in pass-through revenue, even amid portfolio growth.",

This figure specifically falls under the 'newly acquired or constructed sites' category, which also included contributions from other acquisitions, such as the Spain fiber business acquired in Q2 2022. This $8.5 million represents a distinct portion of the broader $43.6 million generated from newly acquired or constructed sites across all segments, highlighting the contribution of the Telxius acquisition to Europe segment growth in 2023.",

      "answer": "The Latin America property segment reported revenue growth of $106.4 million, of which only $0.3 million came from 'other tenant billings,' indicating minimal contribution from this category. However, the strategic importance of the region is underscored by the Telxius acquisition, which added over 7,000 communications sites across Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, with total consideration of approximately $1.1 billion. This suggests that while 'other tenant billings' contribute little to current revenue, the region's long-term strategic value is tied to its infrastructure expansion and potential for future revenue growth.",

      "answer": "The $1.1 billion reclassification of AMT's cumulative translation adjustment in India is a major component of the $1.2 billion loss on sale of ATC TIPL, indicating that a significant portion of the loss was driven by the reversal of previously accumulated foreign exchange translation adjustments upon exiting the Indian market. This highlights the material financial impact of exiting a foreign market, where the unwinding of historical currency translation effects contributes substantially to the overall loss. The connection between the cumulative translation adjustment and the loss on sale underscores how exiting a market involves not only the realization of asset impairments but also the recognition of previously unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments, which together shape the final financial outcome of the divestiture.",

In late 2022, VIL had communicated its intent to resume payments in full under its contractual obligations owed to the Company beginning on January 1, 2023. However, in early 2023, VIL communicated that it would not be able to resume payments in full of its contractual obligations owed to the Company, and that it would instead continue to make partial payments. In the second half of 2023, VIL began making payments in full of its monthly contractual obligations owed to the Company.\n\nThe Company considered these developments and the uncertainty with respect to amounts owed under its tenant leases when conducting its 2022 annual impairment assessments for long-lived assets in India. A probability weighted assessment was performed, incorporating current and expected industry and market conditions and trends and, as a result, the Company determined that certain fixed and intangible assets had been impaired during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\n- An impairment of $97.0 million was taken on tower and network location intangible assets in India.\n- The Company also impaired the tenant-related intangible assets for VIL, which resulted in an impairment of $411.6 million.\n\n## Goodwill Impairments\n\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment annually (as of December 31) or whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, as further discussed in note 1.\n\nThe Company concluded that a triggering event occurred during the year ended December 31, 2023 with respect to its India reporting unit primarily due to indications of value received from third parties in connection with the Company's review of various strategic alternatives for its India operations, which concluded in the ATC TIPL Transaction (as defined in note 22). As a result, the Company performed an interim quantitative goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023, using, among other things, the information obtained from third parties to compare the estimated fair value of the India reporting unit to its carrying amount, including goodwill. The result of the Company's interim goodwill impairment test as of September 30, 2023",

      "answer": "The increase in Limited Partners' interests in the Operating Partnership from $447,494 million in 2023 to $451,339 million in 2024 indicates a growing noncontrolling stake in the entity that directly operates SPG's business. This rise in noncontrolling interest could potentially affect Simon\u2019s equity control if Limited Partners choose to exercise their exchange rights, which allow them to convert units into Simon common stock on a one-for-one basis or receive cash. Simon has reserved 56,002,333 shares for such exchanges, suggesting a significant potential dilution risk if the exchange option is heavily utilized. However, Simon\u2019s Board of Directors controls whether an exchange is settled in stock or cash, giving them discretion to manage dilution. The consolidated reporting structure of the Operating Partnership, as outlined in the 10-K\u2019s introduction, further reflects that while the Operating Partnership holds the assets and incurs debt, Simon maintains operational and strategic control over the enterprise. This dual structure allows Simon to manage the financial and operational impacts of these exchange rights while maintaining a unified business strategy.",

      "answer": "The pro forma results, which assume the 2021 and 2020 acquisitions occurred earlier, explicitly exclude integration costs and anticipated synergies, suggesting a cleaner view of historical performance without acquisition impacts. However, the financial statements reveal that AMT incurred $63.3 million of previously deferred interest and acquisition-related costs in 2021, which were part of the actual financial experience. This discrepancy indicates that the pro forma figures, while useful for comparative analysis, do not fully reflect the true financial burden of integration activities. As a result, stakeholders evaluating AMT's performance must consider both the pro forma results and the actual costs disclosed to understand the full impact of the acquisitions on operating results.",

      "question": "Given AMT's 52% ownership in ATC Europe, which holds an 83% stake in Spain Operations, and the significant dividend distributions from Spain Operations to ATC Europe in 2024, how does the layered ownership structure impact the proportion of cash flow ultimately received by AMT compared to its noncontrolling partners from Spain-related operations?",
      "answer": "AMT holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, which in turn holds an 83% stake in Spain Operations. In 2024, Spain Operations distributed \u20ac92.4 million (approximately $98.9 million) in dividends to ATC Europe and PGGM based on their respective equity interests. This means ATC Europe received 83% of that amount, or approximately $82.1 million. As AMT owns 52% of ATC Europe, it effectively received 52% of that $82.1 million, or about $42.7 million, while CDPQ (30%) and Allianz (18%) received the remaining $39.4 million collectively. Therefore, the layered ownership structure results in AMT receiving a diluted but still majority share of the cash flow from Spain Operations, with the rest distributed to its European partners.",

The Company currently holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, with CDPQ and Allianz holding 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively. ATC Europe holds a 100% interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in France and an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively, with PGGM holding a 13% and a 17% noncontrolling interest in each respective subsidiary.\n\nBangladesh Partnership -In August 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited ('KTBL') for 900 million BDT (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing). Confidence Group holds a 49% noncontrolling interest in KTBL.\n\nStonepeak Transaction -In 2022, the Company entered into agreements pursuant to which certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Partners LP (such investment vehicles, collectively, 'Stonepeak') acquired a noncontrolling ownership interest in the Company's U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of $3.1 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity (the 'Stonepeak Transaction').",

We recorded a gain on the sales of ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand of $8.5 million, which is included in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The divestitures did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that offsets our REIT taxable income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2024, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain and Uganda.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments. Our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now have six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. This change aligns with our management structure and better aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on ex isting leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings",

      "question": "How did the $23.8 million increase in pass-through revenue from energy costs in Latin America contribute to the $106.4 million total revenue growth in that segment, and how does this align with the strategic implications of AMT's $1.1 billion investment in Latin American communications sites through the Telxius acquisition?",
      "answer": "The Latin America property segment achieved $106.4 million in revenue growth, of which $23.8 million was attributed to increased pass-through revenue driven by higher energy costs, particularly in Brazil. This indicates that rising operational expenses borne by tenants significantly contributed to top-line growth in the region. This aligns with AMT's strategic investment through the Telxius acquisition, where $1.1 billion was specifically allocated to acquire over 7,000 communications sites in Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina. The growth in pass-through revenue suggests that AMT's Latin American asset base is not only expanding through acquisitions but also generating incremental revenue from existing infrastructure due to external cost pressures, reinforcing the strategic value of the region within AMT's global portfolio.",

      "question": "How does the $0.7 million decline in 'other tenant billings' revenue in the Europe property segment contrast with the segment's overall $47.2 million tenant billings growth in 2023, and what does this reveal about the revenue composition following the 2021 Telxius acquisition?",
      "answer": "The Europe property segment reported $47.2 million in tenant billings growth in 2023, driven by contractual escalations, colocations, and new sites acquired or constructed. However, this was partially offset by a $0.7 million decrease specifically in 'other tenant billings.' This contrast suggests that while the segment is experiencing broad growth from core leasing activities and recent acquisitions\u2014such as the Telxius towers acquired in 2021\u2014the decline in 'other tenant billings' may indicate a contraction or shift in ancillary revenue streams. Given that the Telxius acquisition added nearly 20,000 sites in Germany and Spain to the Europe property segment, the overall growth in tenant billings reflects the integration and operational expansion of these sites, while the drop in 'other tenant billings' could signal a potential area of instability or strategic repositioning within the segment's revenue mix.",

ATC Europe declared and paid aggregate dividends of 422.5 million EUR (approximately $465.1 million) in 2024, distributed proportionally to equity holders. As a result, AMT received 52% of this distribution, or approximately 219.7 million EUR (about $241.9 million), despite having only a minority controlling stake. This structure allows AMT to benefit from the cash flow generated by the France operations within ATC Europe, while minority partners CDPQ (30%) and Allianz (18%) absorb a significant portion of the remaining dividend outflow.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, we also completed the sales of our subsidiaries in Australia ('ATC Australia') and New Zealand ('ATC New Zealand') for total aggregate consideration of approximately $77.6 million. We recorded a gain on the sales of ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand of $8.5 million, which is included in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The divestitures did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that offsets our REIT taxable income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2024, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain and Uganda.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments. Our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now have six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. This change aligns with our management structure and better aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on ex isting leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings",

During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company paid $12.0 million of distributions upon the vesting of restricted stock units.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\n\nEuropean InterestsIn 2021, PGGM converted its previously held noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary that primarily consisted of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Poland into noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries, consisting of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain. In 2021, Caisse de d\u00e9p\u00f4t et placement du Qu\u00e9bec ('CDPQ') and Allianz insurance companies and funds managed by Allianz Capital Partners GmbH, including the Allianz European Infrastructure Fund (collectively, 'Allianz') acquired 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively, in ATC Europe for total aggregate consideration of 2.6 billion EUR (approximately $3.1 billion at the date of closing).\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, ATC Europe consists of the Company's operations in France, Germany and Spain. The Company currently holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, with CDPQ and Allianz holding 30% and 18% noncontrolling interests, respectively. ATC Europe holds a 100% interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in France and an 87% and an 83% controlling interest in the subsidiaries that consist of the Company's operations in Germany and Spain, respectively, with PGGM holding a 13% and a 17% noncontrolling interest in each respective subsidiary.\n\nBangladesh Partnership -In August 2021, the Company acquired a 51% controlling interest in Kirtonkhola Tower Bangladesh Limited ('KTBL') for 900 million BDT (approximately $10.6 million at the date of closing). Confidence Group holds a 49% noncontrolling interest in KTBL.\n\nStonepeak Transaction -In 2022, the Company entered into agreements pursuant to which certain investment vehicles affiliated with Stonepeak Partners LP (such investment vehicles, collectively, 'Stonepeak') acquired a noncontrolling ownership interest in the Company's U.S. data center business for total aggregate consideration of $3.1 billion, through an investment in common equity and mandatorily convertible preferred equity (the 'Stonepeak Transaction').",

As of December 31, 2024, the amount accrued for Stonepeak Preferred Distributions was $11.6 million.\n\nBeginning in January 2024, pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreement with Stonepeak, on a quarterly basis, the Company's U.S. data center business will distribute common dividends to the Company and to Stonepeak in proportion to their respective equity interests in the Company's U.S. data center business (the 'Stonepeak Common Dividend'). During the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company's U.S. data center business made distributions of $91.7 million related to the Stonepeak Common Dividend for the period from the initial closing of the Stonepeak Transaction in August 2022 through December 31, 2023, which was accrued for as of December 31, 2023. The $91.7 million distribution during the year ended December 31, 2024 included a noncash distribution of $37.5 million made in lieu of a common equity contribution from Stonepeak. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company's U.S. data center business declared and paid distributions of $47.4 million, related to the Stonepeak Common Dividend.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024 , pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreements, ATC Europe C.V., one of the Company's subsidiaries in the Netherlands, declared and paid aggregate dividends of 422.5 million EUR (approximately $465.1 million at the dates of payment), pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreements, to the Company, CDPQ and Allianz in proportion to their respective equity interests in ATC Europe C.V.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreements, AT Rhine C.V., one of the Company's subsidiaries in Germany, declared and paid aggregate dividends of 105.0 million EUR (approximately $115.6 million at the dates of payment), pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreements, to ATC Europe and PGGM in proportion to their respective equity interests in AT Rhine C.V.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2024, pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreements, AT Iberia C.V., one of the Company's subsidiaries in Spain, declared and paid aggregate dividends of 92.4 million EUR (approximately $98.9 million at the dates of payment), pursuant to the terms of the ownership agreements, to ATC Europe and PGGM in proportion to their respective equity interests in AT Iberia C.V.\n\nThe changes in noncontrolling interests were as follows:\n\n",

      "answer": "Analysts should assess that the $32.7 million increase in 'Other Expense' includes an unspecified portion related to ground lease expenses, which are aggregated with other costs like legal fees. Since ground lease expenses are not disclosed separately, analysts must consider the lack of granularity in evaluating SPG's operating cost structure and its potential impact on key REIT compliance metrics like funds from operations (FFO).",

During 2019, we recorded net gains of $62.1 million primarily related to Kl\u00e9pierre's disposition of certain shopping centers, offset by a $47.2 million impairment charge related to an unconsolidated investment.\n\nSimon's net income attributable to noncontrolling interests decreased $156.8 million due to a decrease in the net income of the Operating Partnership.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\nBecause we own long-lived income-producing assets, our financing strategy relies primarily on long-term fixed rate debt. Floating rate debt comprised only 7.6% of our total consolidated debt at December 31, 2021. We also enter into  interest  rate  protection  agreements from time to time to manage our interest rate risk. We derive most of our liquidity  from  positive  net  cash  flow  from  operations  and  distributions  of  capital  from  unconsolidated  entities  that totaled $3.9 billion in the aggregate during 2021. The Credit Facilities and the Commercial Paper program provide alternative sources of liquidity as our cash needs vary from time to time. Borrowing capacity under these sources may be increased as discussed further below.\n\nOur  balance  of  cash  and  cash  equivalents  decreased  $477.7  million  during  2021  to  $533.9  million  as  of December 31, 2021 as further discussed below.\n\nOn December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate available borrowing capacity of approximately $5.8 billion under the  Facilities,  net  of  outstanding  borrowings  of  $1.18  billion,  amounts  outstanding  under  the  Commercial  Paper program of $500.0 million and letters of credit of $11.8 million. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the maximum aggregate  outstanding  balance  under  the  Credit  Facilities  was  $2.1  billion  and  the  weighted  average  outstanding balance was $519.9 million. The weighted average interest rate was 0.85% for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n\nSimon has historically had access to public equity markets and the Operating Partnership has historically had access to private and public, short and long-term unsecured debt markets and access to secured debt and private equity from institutional investors at the property level.\n\nOur business model and Simon's status as a REIT require us to regularly access the debt markets to raise funds for acquisition, development and redevelopment activity, and to refinance maturing debt. Simon may also, from time to time, access the equity capital markets to accomplish our business objectives. We believe we have sufficient cash on hand and availability under the Credit Facilities  and  the  Commercial  Paper  program  to  address  our  debt maturities and capital needs through 2022.",

This indicates that contractual escalations were the primary organic growth driver within the segment, while acquisitions and new builds contributed a smaller but still meaningful portion of the growth.

      "answer": "Simon's structural relationship with the Operating Partnership enables it to manage capital through unit exchanges and redemptions, as outlined in the partnership agreement. During 2024, the Operating Partnership redeemed 288,350 units from limited partners for $42.3 million, which increased Simon's ownership stake in the Operating Partnership. This capital management flexibility is further enhanced by the Board's authority to reclassify excess common stock into additional classes or series, allowing Simon to issue new types of capital stock for strategic purposes such as acquisitions or to influence control dynamics. The ability to redeem units and issue new stock classes provides Simon with tools to adjust its capital structure and ownership composition while maintaining operational control through the Operating Partnership.",

This segment was restructured in Q4 2024 as part of a broader realignment that combined APAC and Africa into one segment, while retaining Europe as a distinct reporting unit.

We recorded a gain on the sales of ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand of $8.5 million, which is included in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The divestitures did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that offsets our REIT taxable income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2024, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain and Uganda.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments. Our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now have six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. This change aligns with our management structure and better aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on ex isting leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings",

(Spain operations subsidiary) to ATC Europe indicate about the financial alignment and REIT compliance of AMT's European structure, especially considering Spain's inclusion in the REIT-qualified international operations?",
      "answer": "The 92.4 million EUR dividend from AT Iberia C.V. to ATC Europe indicates strong financial integration within AMT's European structure, where local subsidiaries like AT Iberia (Spain) contribute directly to the regional holding company, ATC Europe, in which AMT holds a 52% controlling interest. This aligns with the earlier statement that Spain is part of AMT's REIT-qualified international operations, suggesting that the dividend flow is structured to maintain REIT compliance while consolidating international earnings through controlled European entities. The fact that AMT reports this dividend in the financial statements (page 129) confirms the transparency and traceability of these cross-border distributions, which are critical for maintaining REIT status while managing global tax obligations.",

      "answer": "AMT holds a 52% controlling interest in ATC Europe, which in turn holds an 87% stake in the subsidiaries that operate in Germany. This layered ownership structure allows AMT to consolidate financial results while managing capital deployment across international jurisdictions. Since AMT's Germany operations are REIT-qualified, the income derived from these operations is generally not subject to U.S. federal income taxes, enhancing after-tax returns. Furthermore, during 2024, AT Rhine C.V., a German subsidiary under ATC Europe, paid aggregate dividends of \u20ac105.0 million (approximately $115.6 million), which were distributed in proportion to equity interests. This dividend flow through ATC Europe to AMT supports capital deployment in a tax-efficient manner, aligning with the REIT structure that minimizes U.S. federal tax liabilities on international REIT-qualified income.",

We recorded a gain on the sales of ATC Australia and ATC New Zealand of $8.5 million, which is included in Other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. The divestitures did not qualify for presentation as discontinued operations.\n\nWe operate as a real estate investment trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes ('REIT'). Accordingly, we generally are not required to pay U.S. federal income taxes on income generated by our REIT operations, including the income derived from leasing space on our towers and in our data centers, as we receive a dividends paid deduction for distributions to stockholders that offsets our REIT taxable income and gains. However, we remain obligated to pay U.S. federal income taxes on earnings from our domestic taxable REIT subsidiaries ('TRSs'). In addition, our international assets and operations, regardless of their classification for U.S. tax purposes, continue to be subject to taxation in the jurisdictions where those assets are held or those operations are conducted.\n\nThe use of TRSs enables us to continue to engage in certain businesses and jurisdictions while complying with REIT qualification requirements. We may, from time to time, change the election of previously designated TRSs to be included as part of the REIT. As of December 31, 2024, our REIT-qualified businesses included our U.S. tower leasing business, a majority of our U.S. DAS networks business, our Services and Data Centers segments, as well as most of our operations in Canada, Costa Rica, France, Germany, Ghana, Kenya, Mexico, Nigeria, South Africa, Spain and Uganda.\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2024, following recent divestitures, including the ATC TIPL Transaction, and changes to our organizational structure, we reviewed and changed our reportable segments. Our Asia-Pacific ('APAC') property segment and our Africa property segment were combined into the Africa &amp; APAC property segment. As a result, we now have six reportable segments: U.S. &amp; Canada property (which includes all assets in the United States and Canada, other than our data center facilities and related assets), Africa &amp; APAC property, Europe property, Latin America property, Data Centers and Services. This change aligns with our management structure and better aligns our reporting with management's current approach of allocating costs and resources, managing growth and profitability and assessing the operating performance of our business segments.\n\n## Products and Services\n\n## Property Operations\n\nOur property operations accounted for 98%, 99% and 98% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Our revenue is primarily generated from tenant leases. Within our tower leasing operations, our tenants lease space on our communications real estate, where they install and maintain their equipment. Rental payments vary considerably depending upon numerous factors, including, but not limited to, amount, type and position of tenant equipment on the tower, remaining tower capacity and tower location. Our costs typically include ground rent (which is primarily fixed under long-term lease agreements with annual cost escalations) and power and fuel costs, some or all of which may be passed through to our tenants, as well as property taxes and repair and maintenance expenses. Our property operations have generated consistent growth in revenue and typically have low cash flow volatility due to the following characteristics:\n\n- Long-term tenant leases with contractual rent escalations. In general, our tenant leases for our communications sites with wireless carriers have initial noncancellable terms of five to ten years with multiple renewal terms, with provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease, typically annually, based on a fixed escalation percentage (averaging approximately 3% in the United States) or an inflationary index in most of our international markets, or a combination of both. Based upon foreign currency exchange rates and the tenant leases in place as of December 31, 2024, we expect to generate nearly $54 billion of non-cancellable tenant lease revenue over future periods, before the impact of straight-line lease accounting.\n- Consistent demand for our sites. As a result of rapidly growing usage of mobile data and other wireless services and the corresponding wireless industry capital spending trends in the markets we serve, we anticipate consistent demand for our communications sites. We believe that our global asset base positions us well to benefit from the increasing proliferation of advanced wireless devices and the increasing usage of high bandwidth applications on those devices. We have the ability to add new tenants and new equipment for existing tenants on our sites, which typically results in incremental revenue and modest incremental costs. Our site portfolio and our established tenant base provide us with a solid platform for new business opportunities, which has historically resulted in consistent and predictable organic revenue growth.\n- High lease renewal rates. Our tenants tend to renew leases because suitable alternative sites may not exist or be available and repositioning a site in their network may be expensive and may adversely affect network quality. We define churn as tenant billings lost when a tenant cancels or does not renew its lease or, in limited circumstances, when the lease rates on ex isting leases are reduced. We derive our churn rate for a given year by dividing our tenant billings",

This valuation methodology contrasts with the inclusion of derivative instruments like interest rate caps and swaps, which are also housed within Deferred Costs and Other Assets and reported at fair value. As of the same date, the carrying value of these derivative instruments was $6.1 million, indicating that while a significant portion of the category uses observable market pricing (Level 1), certain components\u2014like derivatives\u2014are likely valued using less transparent or more complex methodologies.

W e m anage exposure to interest rate m arket risk through our risk m anagem ent strategy by a com bination of interest rate protection agreem ents to effectively fix or cap a portion of variable rate debt.\n\nWe may enter into treasury lock agreem ents as part of an anticipated debt issuance. U pon com pletion of the debt issuance, the fair value of these instrum ents is recorded as part of accum ulated other com prehensive incom e (loss) and is am ortized to interest expense over the life of the debt agreem ent.\n\nThe unam ortized gain on our treasury locks and term inated hedges recorded in accum ulated other com prehensive incom e was $40.8 m illion and $41.9 m illion  as  of  D ecem ber  31,  2024  and  2023,  respectively.    W ithin  the  next  year,  we  expect  to  reclassify  to earnings approxim ately $6.1 m illion of gains related to term inated interest rate swaps from  the current balance held in accum ulated other comprehensive incom e (loss).\n\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency risk on financings of certain foreign operations. O ur intent is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposers, with gains and losses on the derivative contracts hedging these exposers. W e do not enter into either interest rate protection or foreign currency rate protection agreem ents for speculative purposes.\n\nWe are  also  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  foreign  exchange  rates  on  financial  instrum ents  which  are  denom inated  in  foreign currencies,  prim arily  in  Y en  and  E uro.      W e  use  currency  forward  contracts,  cross  currency  swap  contracts,  and  nonderivative instrum ents such as foreign currency denom inated debt to m anage our exposure to changes in foreign exchange rates on certain Yen and E uro-denom inated receivables and net investm ents.  C urrency forward contracts involve fixing the Yen:U SD  or E uro:U SD  exchange rate for delivery of a specified am ount of foreign currency on a specified date. T he currency forward contracts are typically cash settled in U .S. dollars for their fair value at or close to their settlem ent date.",
