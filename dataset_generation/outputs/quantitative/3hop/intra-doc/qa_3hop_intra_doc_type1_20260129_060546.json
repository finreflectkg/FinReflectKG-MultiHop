      "answer": "Chevron's 'Corporate Administrative Functions' are categorized under the 'All Other' segment, which includes cash management, debt financing, insurance, and technology companies. In the 2024 restructuring plan, $274 million of the $980 million total severance charge was allocated to 'All Other', indicating that a significant portion of the workforce reductions targeted corporate-level functions. This aligns with the broader cost-cutting initiative aiming for $2\u20133 billion in structural savings by 2026, suggesting that corporate administrative roles are a key area for streamlining operations.",

          "chunk_text": "- Impairment of Investments in Nonconsolidated Entities -Investments in nonconsolidated entities are assessed for impairment whenever changes in the facts and circumstances indicate a loss in value has occurred. When such a condition is judgmentally determined to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to fair value. The fair value of the impaired investment is based on quoted market prices, if available, or upon the present value of expected future cash flows using discount rates and prices believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants, plus market analysis of comparable assets owned by the investee, if appropriate.\n- Guarantees -The fair value of a guarantee is determined and recorded as a liability at the time the guarantee is given. The initial liability is subsequently reduced as we are released from exposure under the guarantee. We amortize the guarantee liability over the relevant time period, if one exists, based on the facts and circumstances surrounding each type of guarantee. In cases where the guarantee term is indefinite, we reverse the l i a bi l i ty when we have information indicating the liability is essentially relieved or amortize it over an appropriate time period as the fair value of our guarantee exposure declines over time. We amortize the guarantee liability to the related income statement line item based on the nature of the guarantee. When it becomes probable that we will have to perform on a guarantee, we accrue a separate liability if it is reasonably estimable, based on the facts and circumstances at that time. We reverse the fair value liability only when there is no further exposure under the guarantee.\n- Share-Based Compensation -We recognize share-based compensation expense over the shorter of the service period (i.e., the stated period of time required to earn the award) or the period beginning at the start of the service period and ending when an employee first becomes eligible for retirement. We have elected to recognize expense on a straight-line basis over the service period for the entire award, whether the award was granted with ratable or cliff vesting.\n- Income Taxes -Deferred income taxes are computed using the liability method and are provided on all temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities, except for deferred taxes on income and temporary differences related to the cumulative translation adjustment considered to be permanently reinvested in certain foreign subsidiaries and foreign corporate joint ventures. Allowable tax credits are applied currently as reductions of the provision for income taxes. Interest related to unrecognized tax benefits is reflected in interest and debt expense, and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are reflected in production and operating expenses.\n- Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities -Sales and value-added taxes are recorded net.\n- Net Income (Loss) Per Share of Common Stock -Basic net income (loss) per share (EPS) is calculated using the two-class method. Under the two-class method, all earnings (distributed and undistributed) are allocated to common stock (including fully vested stock and unit awards that have not yet been i s s ued as common stock) and participating securities. ConocoPhillips grants Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) under its share-based compensation programs, the majority of which entitle recipients to receive non-forfeitable dividends during the vesting period on a basis equivalent to dividends paid to holders of the company's common stock. See Note 15 . These unvested RSUs meet the definition of participating securities based on their respective rights to receive non-forfeitable dividends and are treated as a separate class of securities in computing basic EPS. Participating securities are not i ncluded as incremental shares in computing diluted EPS. Diluted EPS includes the potential impact of contingently issuable shares, including awards which require future service as a condition of delivery of the underlying common stock. Diluted EPS is calculated under both the two-class and treasury stock methods, and the more dilutive amount is reported. Diluted net loss per share does not assume conversion or exelrcise of securities that would have an antidilutive effect. Treasury stock is excluded from the daily weighted-average number of common shares outstanding in both calculations. See Note 22 .",

This reduction aligns with an increase in the discount rate assumption used to calculate these obligations, which rose from 5.1% in 2023 to 5.2% in 2028.

      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's divestment activity impact its natural gas production volumes, given the company's reserve reporting methodology and the reconciliation factors provided for production changes?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil reported that natural gas production available for sale in 2021 was 8.5 billion cubic feet per day, which increased slightly from 2020 but was partly offset by divestments. This must be interpreted alongside the company\u2019s reserve reporting methodology, which calculates proved reserves using average prices from the prior 12 months and accounts for production sharing contracts where production volumes can vary inversely with prices. Additionally, the company defines divestments as reductions in production due to equity reductions in assets, indicating that divestments directly reduce production volumes. Therefore, while natural gas production saw growth from demand, the volume impact of divestments acted as a counterforce, reflecting a strategic realignment that affects both reserve disclosures and operational production metrics.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

      "answer": "The Alaska segment contributed less than 1 percent of ConocoPhillips\u2019 consolidated natural gas production in 2021, indicating a limited role in the company\u2019s overall gas output. However, the segment reported a significant turnaround in financial performance, earning $1,386 million in 2021 compared to a loss of $719 million in 2020. This earnings improvement was driven by higher realized crude oil prices, the absence of 2020 exploration expenses (including a $648 million after-tax impairment), and lower dry hole expenses. Despite a 1 MBOED decline in average production due to normal field decline, production was supported by the absence of curtailments and improved performance in key areas like the Greater Prudhoe Area and Western North Slope. This suggests that while Alaska plays a minor role in natural gas production, its profitability is heavily influenced by crude oil prices and cost management, rather than gas volumes.",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of $369 million in contingent payments in 2021 for the Lower 48 segment reconcile with the segment's asset impairment charges driven by declining fair values during the same period?",
      "answer": "In 2021, ConocoPhillips recognized $369 million in contingent payments related to prior asset dispositions, a portion of which was allocated to the Lower 48 segment. These contingent payments were positively reflected in the segment\u2019s earnings as part of the company\u2019s overall net income increase. However, during the same year, the Lower 48 segment also experienced asset impairments due to declines in fair value, which were calculated using internal discounted cash flow models based on future production estimates, commodity price outlooks, and discount rates. This dual impact suggests that while contingent payments provided a financial uplift, the segment simultaneously faced valuation pressures from deteriorating asset values. The contrast highlights the mixed financial health of the Lower 48 segment\u2014benefiting from post-disposition gains but burdened by impairments on noncore assets.",

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2020 is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of ConocoPhillips with the results of Concho and the assets acquired from Shell.  The pro forma results do not include transaction-related costs, nor any cost savings anticipated as a result of the transactions.  The pro forma results include adjustments from Concho's historical results to reverse impairment expense of $ 10.5 billion and $1.9 billion related to oil and gas properties and goodwill, respectively. Other adjustments made relate primarily to DD&amp;A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to properties, plants and equipment.  We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are  properly reflected.\n\n## Announced Acquisitions\n\nIn December 2021, we announced that we have notified Origin Energy that we are exercising our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG from Origin Energy for $ 1.645 billion, which will be funded from cash on the balance sheet, before customary adjustments.  The effective date of the transaction will be July 1, 2020 with closing anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2022 subject to Australian government approval.   See Note 4 and Note 7 .\n\n## Assets Sold\n\nIn 2020, we completed the sale of our Australia -West asset and operations.  The sales agreement entitled us to a $200 million payment upon a final investment decision (FID) of the Barossa development project.  On March 30, 2021, FID was announced and as such, we recognized a $200 million gain on disposition in the first quarter of 2021. The purchaser failed to pay the FID bonus when due.  We have commenced an arbitration proceeding against the purchaser to enforce our contractual right to the $ 200 million, plus interest accruing from the due date.  Results of operations related to this transaction are reflected in our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 11 .\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for approximately $250 million after customary adjustments, recognizing a before-tax gain on sale of approximately $58 million.  We also completed the sale of our noncore exploration interests in Argentina, recognizing a beforetax loss on disposition of $179 million.  Results of operations for Argentina were reported in our Other International segment.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded contingent payments of $ 369 million relating to previous dispositions.  The contingent payments are recorded as gain on disposition on our consolidated income statement and are reflected within our Canada and Lower 48 segments.  In our Canada segment, the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel .  The term for contingent payments in our Canada segment ends on May 16, 2022.  In our Lower 48 segment, the contingent payment, paid on an annual basis, is calculated monthly at $7 million per month in which the U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per MMBTU .  The term for contingent payments in our Lower 48 segment goes through 2023. No contingent payments were recorded in 2020.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell two subsidiaries holding our Indonesia assets and operations to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion, before customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2021.  The subsidiaries hold our 54 percent interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a35 percent shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company.  The net carrying value is approximately $0.4 billion, which consists primarily of PP&amp;E.  The assets met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter,  and as of December 31, 2021, we have reclassified $ 0.3 billion of PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and $ 0.1 billion of noncurrent ARO to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet.  The before-tax earnings associated with our Indonesia subsidiaries were $ 604 million, $394 million and $512 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively .  This transaction is expected to close in early 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other specific conditions precedent.  Results of operations for the subsidiaries to be sold are reported within our Asia Pacific segment.",

This seemingly contradictory outcome is explained by the structure of tax calculations tied to production volumes rather than prices \u2014 while higher volumes increased cost bases and thus operating expenses, they also led to volume-based tax credits or lower effective rates on non-income taxes. Despite lower realized commodity prices negatively affecting earnings, the tax burden was reduced due to these volume-driven tax benefits, illustrating how operational scale can create both cost and tax-efficiency advantages.",

      "answer": "The Lower 48 segment reported a $431 million increase in production and operating expenses directly tied to the Marathon Oil acquisition, including transportation costs and lease operating expenses. This operational impact aligns with the broader financial implications of the acquisition, which added $10.8 billion in provisional fair value for unproved oil and gas properties that management has not yet finalized. Meanwhile, the consolidated production and operating expenses for the full company increased by $1,058 million in 2024, with the Lower 48 segment being a key contributor due to higher lease and transportation costs. The ongoing uncertainty around the final valuation of unproved properties introduces a layer of complexity in assessing the long-term cost and profitability trajectory of the Lower 48 segment, especially as the acquisition continues to influence both expense trends and asset valuations.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

See Note 3 .\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $453 million in 2024, primarily due to transaction expenses of $545 million associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil, partially offset by lower compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs. See Note 15 .\n\nDD&amp;A increased $1,329 million in 2024 primarily due to higher volumes in our Lower 48 and Canada segments, higher rates in our Alaska and Lower 48 segments and the impact of our acquisition of Marathon Oil.

      "answer": "The $746 million in total exploration expenses reported for 2019 includes costs associated with dry hole activities, which are a subset of exploration expenses. By 2021, the company notes a significant decrease in exploration expenses, largely due to the absence of prior-year impairments and lower dry hole expenses, particularly in Alaska. This implies that the company experienced a reduction in unsuccessful exploration activity, contributing positively to earnings. The contrast between the $746 million in 2019 and the reduced dry hole costs in 2021 highlights the volatility of exploration expenses and suggests a more disciplined or successful exploration strategy in 2021 compared to earlier periods.",

See Note 3 .\n- A gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020.\n- Lower exploration expenses due to:\n- o Absence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after  -tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset.\n- o Lower dry hole expenses.\n- o Absence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska.\n- o Absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans.\n- Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices.\n- Contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments.\n- An after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a FID bonus associated with our Australia -West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3 .\n- Lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7 .\n\nThese increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:\n\n- Higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes.\n- Higher DD&amp;A expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021.\n- Absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our Australia-West divestiture completed in May 2020.\n- Restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the Concho and Shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.",

The decreases were partially offset by $200 million related to a FID bonus associated with our Australia-West divestiture, gains recognized for contingent payments associated with previous dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments and gains on sales of certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment.\n\nOther income (loss) increased $1.7 billion in 2021, primarily due to a gain of $1,040 million on our CVE common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million loss on those shares in 2020. See Note 5 .\n\nPurchased commodities increased 125 percent in 2021, primarily in line with higher gas and crude prices and volumes.\n\nProduction and operating expenses increased $1,350 million in 2021, primarily in line with higher production volumes.\n\nSelling, general and administrative expenses increased $289 million in 2021, primarily due to transaction and restructuring expenses associated with our Concho acquisition and higher compensation and benefits costs, including mark-to-market impacts of certain key employee compensation programs.\n\nExploration expenses decreased $1,113 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of 2020 expenses including an $828 million impairment for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset, the early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska, and absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses from 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia.  2021 also saw lower dry hole expenses in Alaska.\n\nImpairments decreased $139 million in 2021, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment in 2021.  For additional information, see Note 7 and Note 13 .\n\nTaxes other than income taxes increased $880 million in 2021, caused primarily by higher commodity prices and higher Lower 48 sales volumes.\n\nForeign currency transaction (gains) losses decreased $50 million in 2021 due to the absence of derivative gains and other remeasurements.\n\nSee Note 17-Income Taxes for information regardin g our income tax provision and effective tax rate.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' Canada Segment, which is exposed to contingent payments tied to commodity prices such as WCS crude, benefits from rising energy prices, as seen in the $6 million CAD quarterly contingent payment for every $1 CAD above $52/barrel. This structure provides upside potential without requiring upfront capital investment, aligning with the company's broader capital allocation strategy that prioritizes flexibility and low-carbon investments. In 2022, COP allocated $7.2 billion in capital, including $0.2 billion for emissions-reduction projects and low-carbon opportunities. The contingent payment mechanism in Canada allows COP to participate in commodity price upside without increasing its capital outlay, supporting its strategic focus on disciplined investment and risk mitigation in a volatile fiscal and regulatory environment.",

          "chunk_text": "- Impairments .  We participate in a capital  -intensive industry.  At times, our PP&amp;E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.  As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.  For more information on our impairments, see Note 6 and Note 7 .\n- Effective tax rate .  Our operations are in countries  with different tax rates  and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly  between periods based on the 'mix' of before-tax earnings within our global operations.\n- Fiscal and regulatory environment .  Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments.  These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.  Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Production and Capital\n\n2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion.  The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and $0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.\n\nProduction guidance is 1.8 MMBOED in 2022 including Libya but excluding the impacts from the pending Indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional APLNG shareholding interest.  First quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 MMBOED to 1.79 MMBOED.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\n\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\n\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow,  reflect results from our operations,  including commodity prices and production.",

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2020 is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of ConocoPhillips with the results of Concho and the assets acquired from Shell.  The pro forma results do not include transaction-related costs, nor any cost savings anticipated as a result of the transactions.  The pro forma results include adjustments from Concho's historical results to reverse impairment expense of $ 10.5 billion and $1.9 billion related to oil and gas properties and goodwill, respectively. Other adjustments made relate primarily to DD&amp;A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to properties, plants and equipment.  We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are  properly reflected.\n\n## Announced Acquisitions\n\nIn December 2021, we announced that we have notified Origin Energy that we are exercising our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG from Origin Energy for $ 1.645 billion, which will be funded from cash on the balance sheet, before customary adjustments.  The effective date of the transaction will be July 1, 2020 with closing anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2022 subject to Australian government approval.   See Note 4 and Note 7 .\n\n## Assets Sold\n\nIn 2020, we completed the sale of our Australia -West asset and operations.  The sales agreement entitled us to a $200 million payment upon a final investment decision (FID) of the Barossa development project.  On March 30, 2021, FID was announced and as such, we recognized a $200 million gain on disposition in the first quarter of 2021. The purchaser failed to pay the FID bonus when due.  We have commenced an arbitration proceeding against the purchaser to enforce our contractual right to the $ 200 million, plus interest accruing from the due date.  Results of operations related to this transaction are reflected in our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 11 .\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for approximately $250 million after customary adjustments, recognizing a before-tax gain on sale of approximately $58 million.  We also completed the sale of our noncore exploration interests in Argentina, recognizing a beforetax loss on disposition of $179 million.  Results of operations for Argentina were reported in our Other International segment.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded contingent payments of $ 369 million relating to previous dispositions.  The contingent payments are recorded as gain on disposition on our consolidated income statement and are reflected within our Canada and Lower 48 segments.  In our Canada segment, the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel .  The term for contingent payments in our Canada segment ends on May 16, 2022.  In our Lower 48 segment, the contingent payment, paid on an annual basis, is calculated monthly at $7 million per month in which the U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per MMBTU .  The term for contingent payments in our Lower 48 segment goes through 2023. No contingent payments were recorded in 2020.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell two subsidiaries holding our Indonesia assets and operations to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion, before customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2021.  The subsidiaries hold our 54 percent interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a35 percent shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company.  The net carrying value is approximately $0.4 billion, which consists primarily of PP&amp;E.  The assets met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter,  and as of December 31, 2021, we have reclassified $ 0.3 billion of PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and $ 0.1 billion of noncurrent ARO to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet.  The before-tax earnings associated with our Indonesia subsidiaries were $ 604 million, $394 million and $512 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively .  This transaction is expected to close in early 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other specific conditions precedent.

Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\n\nIn fourth quarter 2024, the company announced plans to achieve $2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including expanded use of global capability centers. In relation to these efforts, the company recognized a restructuring charge of $715 million after tax in fourth quarter 2024, with associated cash outflows anticipated over the next two years. The company continues to evaluate incremental cost reduction opportunities and could incur additional restructuring and reorganization charges in future periods. This will have an impact on the company's pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB) plans; however, the impact is not yet estimable and any impacts will be recognized in future periods.\n\nEarnings trends for the company's major business areas are described as follows:\n\nUpstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. These prices are subject to external factors over  which  the  company  has  no  control,  including  product  demand  connected  with  global  economic  conditions,  industry  production  and  inventory  levels, technology  advancements,  production  quotas  or  other  actions  imposed  by  OPEC+  countries,  actions  of  regulators,  weather-related  damage  and  disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company's control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company's production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\n\nThe longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company's ability to efficiently find, acquire and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn April 2024, Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) achieved start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and at year-end 2024, all four pressure boost facility compressors are online and all metering stations have been converted to low pressure. In January 2025, TCO started oil production at its Future G rowth Project, which is ex pected to contribute to higher free cash flow.\n\nChevron has interests in V enezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in V enezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received G eneral License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in V enezuela subject to certain limitations, and the company continues such activities under this G eneral License. The financial results for Chevron's business in V enezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company's results. Crude oil liftings in V enezuela started in first quarter 2023, which have positively impacted the company's results. The company's independent affiliates have continued to maintain safe and reliable operations; however, future impact on results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nChevron maintains an equity interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) which provides a primary export route for Tengiz field production in Kazakhstan. An adverse  event  or  incident  affecting  CPC  operations,  which  CPC  has  ex perienced  from  time  to  time,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Tengiz  field  and  the company's results of operations and financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions and the February 2025 drone attack on the CPC pumping station, remain uncertain.\n\nOther governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or ex port crude in the region around Russia.\n\nChevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar field in Israel. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and various regional adversaries, the company continues to maintain safe and reliable operations while meeting its contractual commitments. The company continues to monitor the ongoing conflict in the region and any future impacts on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.",

However, the Alaska segment recorded no exploration expenses in 2024, contrasting with a $31 million before-tax dry hole expense in 2023.

      "answer": "The $7,723 million net income decrease for COP in 2023 was partially offset by lower taxes other than income taxes, which positively impacted earnings. This tax benefit was especially relevant to the Alaska segment, which reported earnings of $1,778 million in 2023\u2014down from $2,352 million in 2022\u2014due in part to lower realized crude oil prices. The Alaska segment specifically cited lower taxes other than income taxes as a positive factor in its earnings, aligning with the broader corporate-level impact noted in the consolidated results. This shows that despite a challenging year marked by lower commodity prices and higher operating costs, the Alaska segment benefited from reduced non-income tax burdens, which helped cushion the overall earnings decline both at the segment and corporate levels.",

      "answer": "The $15.37 billion increase in U.S. income before tax, driven by upstream realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments, resulted in a $3.18 billion increase in U.S. income tax expense\u2014from a $1.58 billion tax benefit in 2020 to a $1.60 billion tax charge in 2021. Similarly, the $13.72 billion increase in international income before tax, also driven by higher upstream realizations and the absence of impairments, led to a much larger $4.66 billion increase in international income tax expense\u2014from a $308 million tax benefit in 2020 to a $4.35 billion tax charge in 2021. This comparison shows that while both regions benefited from upstream realizations, the international tax burden grew more significantly in dollar terms, reflecting either higher tax rates or a shift in the geographic mix of upstream profitability.",

      "answer": "The Lower 48 segment reported a decline in earnings in 2023 due to lower realized commodity prices and higher DD&A expenses, which were partially offset by higher production volumes. Despite this, the Lower 48 contributed 76% of consolidated natural gas production in 2023, indicating its continued operational significance. However, during 2021, certain noncore assets within the Lower 48 were impaired due to a decline in fair value below carrying value, suggesting that parts of the segment were underperforming or faced declining future cash flows at that time. The continued high contribution to natural gas production in 2023 implies that COP may have optimized operations or focused on core assets within the Lower 48, despite earlier impairments of noncore assets.",

      "answer": "In 2021, ConocoPhillips reported lower exploration expenses due in part to the absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole costs for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which had been removed from its development plans. This aligns with the 2020 Asia Pacific segment expense of $50 million related to dry hole costs and impairment of the Kamunsu East Field, indicating a strategic decision to discontinue exploration in that area. The 2021 reduction in expenses reflects the company\u2019s shift away from non-core assets, as evidenced by the discontinuation of activities in the Kamunsu East Field, which was also consistent with the broader trend of impairment and divestiture actions seen in other regions like the Alaska North Slope Gas asset and Lower 48 segment. This strategic pivot reduced financial exposure to underperforming or non-core exploration projects.",

      "answer": "The DD&A expense in the Lower 48 segment increased by $562 million in 2024, partly due to the Marathon Oil acquisition, which added new assets subject to depreciation and amortization. This increase is directly tied to the $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion provisional fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties, respectively, acquired from Marathon Oil. These properties are being amortized based on production estimates, which are influenced by proved reserve figures. The higher the capitalized asset base from the acquisition, the greater the DD&A burden, especially as the valuation of these properties relied on significant management assumptions around future commodity prices, production profiles, and discount rates. Thus, the Marathon Oil acquisition not only increased the asset base subject to DD&A but also introduced estimation risk around the fair value of reserves that directly affects future depreciation calculations.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(page_64) \u2192 DD&A: The document explains that DD&A is calculated using the unit-of-production method, which depends heavily on proved reserve estimates. At year-end 2024, the net book value of productive PP&E was $77 billion, with DD&A in 2024 totaling $9.4 billion. A 10% decrease in reserve estimates would have increased DD&A by $1,040 million.",
        "Hop 2: DD&A \u2192 Lower 48 Segment: The Lower 48 segment reported a $562 million increase in DD&A in 2024, partly due to the Marathon Oil acquisition. This reflects the addition of new assets to the segment that are now subject to amortization.",
        "Hop 3: Lower 48 Segment \u2190 COP(page_76): The Marathon Oil acquisition added $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion in provisional fair values for proved and unproved oil and gas properties, respectively, to the Lower 48 segment.

          "chunk_text": "## Proved Reserves\n\nEngineering estimates of the quantities of proved reserves are inherently imprecise and represent only approximate amounts because of the judgments involved i n developing such information. Reserve estimates are based on geological and engineering assessments of in-place hydrocarbon volumes, the production plan, historical extraction recovery and processing yield factors, installed plant operating capacity and approved operating limits. The reliability of these estimates at any point in time depends on both the quality and quantity of the technical and economic data and the efficiency of extracting and processing the hydrocarbons.\n\nDespite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates, accounting rules require disclosure of 'proved' reserve estimates due to the importance of these estimates to better understand the perceived value and future cash flows of a company's operations. There are several authoritative guidelines regarding the engineering criteria that must be met before estimated reserves can be designated as 'proved.' Our geosciences and reservoir engineering organization has policies and procedures in place consistent with these authoritative guidelines. We have trained and experienced internal engineering personnel who estimate our proved reserves held by consolidated companies, as well as our share of equity affiliates. See 'Supplementary Data - Oil and Gas Operations' for additional i nformation.\n\nProved reserve estimates are adjusted annually in the fourth quarter and during the year if significant changes occur and take into account recent production and subsurface information about each field. Also, as required by current authoritative guidelines, the estimated future date when an asset will reach the end of i ts  economic life is based on historical 12-month first-of-month average prices and current costs. This date estimates when production will end and affects the amount of estimated reserves. Therefore, as prices and cost levels change from year to year, the estimate of proved reserves also changes. Generally, our proved reserves decrease as prices decline and increase as prices rise.\n\nOur proved reserves include estimated quantities related to PSCs, reported under the 'economic interest' method, as well as variable-royalty regimes, and are subject to fluctuations in commodity prices, recoverable operating expenses and capital costs. If costs remain stable, reserve quantities attributable to recovery of costs will change inversely to changes in commodity prices. We would expect reserves from these contracts to decrease when product prices rise and i ncrease when prices decline.\n\nThe estimation of proved reserves is also important to the income statement because the proved reserve estimate for a field serves as the denominator in the unit-of-production calculation of the DD&amp;A of the capitalized costs for that asset. At year-end 2024, the net book value of productive PP&amp;E subject to a unit-ofproduction calculation was approximately $77 billion and the DD&amp;A recorded on these assets in 2024 was approximately $9.4 billion. The estimated proved developed reserves for our consolidated operations were 4.4 billion BOE at the end of 2023 and 5.1 billion BOE at the end of 2024. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the unit-of-production calculations had been lower by 10 percent across all calculations, before-tax DD&amp;A in 2024 would have increased by an estimated $1,040 million.\n\n## Business Combination-Valuation of Oil and Gas Properties\n\nFor business combinations, management applies the principles of acquisition accounting under FASB ASC Topic 805 - 'Business Combinations' and allocates the purchase price to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date. Estimating the fair values i nvolves making various assumptions, of which the most significant assumptions relate to the fair values assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties. For significant business combinations, management generally utilizes a discounted cash flow approach, based on market participant assumptions, and considers engaging third party valuation experts in preparing fair value estimates.\n\nSignificant inputs incorporated within the valuation include future commodity price assumptions and production profiles of reserve estimates, future operating and development costs, inflation rates, and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital determined at the time of the acquisition. When estimating the fair value of unproved properties, additional risk-weighting adjustments are applied to probable and possible reserves.\n\nThe assumptions and inputs incorporated within the fair value estimates are subject to considerable management judgement and are based on industry, market and economic conditions prevalent at the time of the acquisition. Although we based these estimates on assumptions believed to be reasonable, these estimates are inherently unpredictable and uncertain and actual results could differ. If the initial accounting for the business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in which the acquisition occurs, an estimate is recorded. Subsequent to the acquisition date, and not later than one year from the acquisition date, we record any material adjustments to the initial estimate based on new information obtained that would have existed as of the date of the acquisition. Any adjustment that arises from information obtained that did not exist as of the date of acquisition is recorded in the period the adjustment arises. See Note 3 .",

      "answer": "The acquisition of Marathon Oil added $13.2 billion in provisional fair value to proved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment, reflecting a strategic move to expand asset base and production capacity. This acquisition contributed to a production increase in the Lower 48, where natural gas production rose from 1,457 million cubic feet per day in 2023 to 1,625 million cubic feet per day in 2024 \u2014 a 168 million cubic feet per day increase. The acquisition not only added new wells in key basins such as the Delaware Basin and Midland Basin but also directly impacted the company\u2019s production metrics, demonstrating how asset acquisitions can translate into measurable operational growth.

      "answer": "The absence of the $648 million after-tax impairment for the Alaska North Slope Gas asset in 2021 contributed significantly to the decrease in exploration expenses compared to 2020. This reduction reflects a strategic decision to no longer pursue the project, which was formally recognized in 2020 when the full carrying value of the asset was impaired, indicating that the project would not advance and there was no current market for it. The removal of this recurring expense in 2021 directly improved the company's cost structure in that year, aligning with the broader trend of reduced exploration spending due to dry hole reductions and the cancellation of non-core programs.",

      "answer": "Chevron's projected 'Other Benefits' liability decreases from $151 million in 2025 to $149 million in 2026, as shown in the long-term benefit obligations table. This decrease coincides with a change in actuarial assumptions, particularly the discount rate applied to 'Other Benefits' obligations, which increased from 2.9% in 2021 to 5.1% in 2023. Higher discount rates reduce the present value of future liabilities, which could explain the decline in projected obligations despite increasing pension liabilities in other categories. The higher discount rate in 2023 likely contributed to the reduction in the 'Other Benefits' liability projection for 2026.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips reported a provisional valuation of $13.2 billion in proved oil and gas properties from the Marathon Oil acquisition (Page 76), which contributed to a production increase of 85 MBOED in the Lower 48 segment in 2024 (Page 46). This production growth was partly due to the Marathon Oil acquisition, as noted in the segment's production commentary. Looking at the reserves table (Page 148), the Lower 48 segment added 73 million barrels of oil equivalent (MBOE) from extensions and discoveries, 800 MBOE from purchases (largely from Marathon), and 367 MBOE from revisions, while producing 413 MBOE during the year. This indicates that the acquisition significantly boosted reserve additions, offsetting natural field decline and enabling production growth. The combination of high reserve additions and increased production underscores the strategic impact of the Marathon acquisition on the Lower 48 segment's operational capacity and reserve base.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "question": "How does the increase in Lower 48 production volumes from new wells and the Marathon Oil acquisition impact the valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties, given the sensitivity of fair value assumptions and the reported depletion of reserves in 2024?",
      "answer": "The acquisition of Marathon Oil added $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion in provisional fair values for proved and unproved oil and gas properties, respectively, within the Lower 48 segment. This acquisition, along with new wells in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin, and Bakken, contributed to an 85 MBOED increase in total average production in 2024. However, the fair value estimation for these properties was sensitive to assumptions such as future commodity prices and production levels, which are subject to change as reserves are depleted. In 2024, the Lower 48 segment reported a production depletion of 413 MBOED, which reduces the total proved reserves from 3,062 million barrels at the end of 2023 to 3,838 million barrels at the end of 2024. This depletion directly affects the valuation of these properties over time, as reserves are a key input in the discounted cash flow models used to estimate fair value. Therefore, the increase in production volumes from acquisitions and new wells must be viewed in the context of ongoing reserve depletion and the sensitivity of fair value estimates to evolving assumptions.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico and commercial operations. During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's emphasis on proved developed reserves in the upstream reserves disclosure reconcile with the relatively small volume of proved developed natural gas reserves disclosed in the properties section for the Other Americas region?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil highlights proved developed reserves as a key metric in its upstream reserves disclosure on page 127, noting that these reserves are recoverable through existing wells and infrastructure, and are critical for assessing near-term production potential. The company reported significant additions to proved reserves in 2024, including 2.3 GOEB from the Pioneer acquisition and 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries. However, in the properties section on page 10, the company discloses that in the Other Americas region, proved developed natural gas reserves stood at only 176 billion cubic feet, a relatively small volume compared to crude oil reserves of 375 million barrels in the same region. This contrast suggests that while the company has substantial overall proved developed reserves, its natural gas position in the Other Americas is less developed, potentially signaling a strategic focus on crude oil in that region or a need for further infrastructure investment to unlock gas reserves.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

This contrasts with the much larger $520 million consolidated foreign currency effect disclosed in the financial summary section, which reflects the cumulative impact of currency fluctuations across all business segments.

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

Approximately $240 is associated with employee reductions in U.S. Upstream, $197 in International Upstream, $247 in U.S. Downstream, $22 in International Downstream and $274 in All Other.

      "question": "How does the acquisition of an additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit in late 2024 impact the overall production trends and reserve balances reported for Alaska, particularly in light of the year-end 2024 production decline and reserve additions?",
      "answer": "The acquisition of an additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit added approximately five MBOED of production in November and December 2024, partially offsetting the overall one MBOED decline in Alaska\u2019s average production for the year. Despite this late-year boost, the 2024 production section notes a net decline due to normal field depletion. This acquisition also contributed to Alaska\u2019s proved reserves increasing from 1,488 million barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 2023 to 1,478 million at the end of 2024, despite production of 81 million barrels during the year. This suggests that the additional working interest played a key role in stabilizing reserve levels even as production declined on an annual average basis.",

        "Hop 1: COP(page_45) \u2192 Additional Working Interest: COP acquired additional working interest in Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit in Q4 2024, adding 5 MBOED of production in November and December.",
        "Hop 2: Additional Working Interest \u2192 Production: The additional working interest directly increased short-term production levels in late 2024, though not enough to offset the annual decline of 1 MBOED.",
        "Hop 3: Production \u2190 COP(page_148): The 2024 production data shows a decline of 81 million barrels in Alaska, yet total proved reserves increased slightly, indicating that the additional working interest contributed to reserve additions despite the production decline."

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips recorded an $828 million impairment in 2020 for the Alaska North Slope Gas asset, indicating the company no longer believed the project would advance. This led to a reduction in exploration expenses in 2021, as noted in the consolidated income statement, due to the absence of further costs related to this asset. By 2022, the consolidated operating results for the year ended December 31, 2021, show that exploration expenses for Alaska had dropped significantly, aligning with the discontinuation of the project. The absence of any exploration expense for Alaska in the 2022 consolidated results confirms the long-term financial impact of the 2020 decision to abandon the asset.",

We no longer believe the project will advance, and there is no current market for the asset.\n\nIn our Other International segment, our interests in the Middle Magdalena Basin of Colombia are in force majeure. As we had no immediate plans to perform under existing contracts; therefore, in 2020, we recorded a before-tax expense totaling $ 84 million for dry hole costs of a previously suspended well and an impairment of the associated capitalized undeveloped leasehold carrying value.\n\nIn our Asia Pacific segment, we recorded before-tax expense of $ 50 million related to dry hole costs of a previously suspended well and an impairment of the associated capitalized undeveloped leasehold carrying value associated with the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia that is no longer in our development plans.\n\n## 2019\n\nIn our Lower 48 segment, we recorded a before-tax impairment of $ 141 million for the associated carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs and dry hole expenses of $ 111 million before-tax due to our decision to discontinue exploration activities related to our Central Louisiana Austin Chalk acreage.",

See Note 3 .\n- A gain of $1,040 million after-tax on our Cenovus Energy (CVE) common shares in 2021, as compared to a $855 million after-tax loss on those shares in 2020.\n- Lower exploration expenses due to:\n- o Absence of a 2020 impairment for $648 million after  -tax for the entire carrying value of capitalized undeveloped leasehold costs related to our Alaska North Slope Gas asset.\n- o Lower dry hole expenses.\n- o Absence of early cancellation of our 2020 winter exploration program in Alaska.\n- o Absence of unproved property impairment and dry hole expenses in 2020 for the Kamunsu East Field in Malaysia, which is no longer in our development plans.\n- Higher equity in earnings of affiliates, primarily due to higher LNG sales prices.\n- Contingent payments related to prior dispositions in our Canada and Lower 48 segments.\n- An after-tax gain of $194 million recognized for a FID bonus associated with our Australia -West divestiture in 2020. See Note 3 .\n- Lower impairments, primarily due to the absence of impairments recognized in 2020 for noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment partially offset by an impairment in our APLNG investment included within our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 7 .\n\nThese increases in net income (loss) were partly offset by:\n\n- Higher production and operating expenses and taxes other than income taxes, primarily due to higher sales volumes.\n- Higher DD&amp;A expenses caused by higher production volumes, partially offset by lower rates driven from positive reserve revisions due to higher commodity prices in 2021.\n- Absence of a $597 million after-tax gain on our Australia-West divestiture completed in May 2020.\n- Restructuring and transaction expenses of $341 million after-tax associated with the Concho and Shell acquisitions in addition to mark-to-market impacts on certain key employee compensation programs.",

      "answer": "Chevron projects a $716 million obligation for Other Benefits between 2029-2033, indicating a significant long-term liability. This projection is influenced by assumptions such as the 5.2% discount rate for interest cost used in 2023, which directly impacts the present value of future obligations.

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "answer": "Chevron operates and holds interests in the Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh, where political unrest has not yet disrupted operations but remains a risk. In 2022, the Bibiyana Field contributed to a 1.8 TCF increase in Asian natural gas proved reserves due to reservoir performance. However, in 2024, Chevron reported a 572 BCF decrease in U.S. natural gas proved reserves, driven primarily by reservoir performance in the DJ basin.

Recent political unrest in the country has not impacted the company's operations to date; however, the future impacts, if any, on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nCommodity Prices The following chart shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $81 per barrel for the full-year 2024, compared to $83 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Brent price was $75 per barrel. The WTI price  averaged  $76  per  barrel  for  the  full-year  2024,  compared  to  $78  in  2023. As  of  mid-February  2025,  the  WTI  price  was  $71  per  barrel.  The  majority  of  the company's equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price averaged $2.25 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the full-year 2024, compared to $2.56 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Henry Hub price was $4.42 per MCF. See page 47 for the company's U.S. and international average realizations for each of the past three years.\n\nCrude prices in 2024 were influenced by geopolitical conflict and OPEC+ supply restraint, which was offset by factors such as non-OPEC supply growth and slowing demand growth.\n\nIn  contrast  to  price  movements  in  the  global  market  for  crude  oil,  prices  for  natural  gas  are  also  impacted  by  regional  supply  and  demand  and  infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, lower Henry Hub prices were driven by high storage levels, strong production, and delayed starts to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects.\n\nOutside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company's long-term contract prices for LNG  are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG  offtake from the operated Australian LNG  projects is committed under binding longterm contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market.\n\nProduction The company's worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2024 was 3.3 million barrels per day, 7 percent higher than in 2023 primarily due to the full-year of legacy PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) production and growth in the Permian Basin. About 20 percent of the company's net oil-equivalent production in 2024 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the Republic of Congo.\n\nThe company estimates its net oil-equivalent production in 2025 to increase six to eight percent over 2024, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $70 per barrel and excluding expected asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greaterthan-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; acquisition and divestment of assets; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and  natural  gas  in  various  markets;  weather  conditions  that  may  shut  in  production;  civil  unrest;  changing  geopolitics;  delays  in  completion  of  maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations.

      "answer": "Chevron's 2024 10-K filing indicates that the Jalalabad field in Bangladesh contributed to a 481 BCF increase in natural gas proved reserves in Asia in 2023, and likely supported continued reserve stability or growth in 2024. However, on page 41, the company notes that while recent political unrest in Bangladesh has not yet impacted operations, future effects remain uncertain. This creates a nuanced picture where the Jalalabad field is a key asset contributing to Chevron's reserve growth, yet its long-term contribution could be at risk if political instability escalates. The alignment between reserve growth and risk acknowledgment suggests Chevron is strategically managing an asset with both upside potential and geopolitical exposure.",

Recent political unrest in the country has not impacted the company's operations to date; however, the future impacts, if any, on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nCommodity Prices The following chart shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $81 per barrel for the full-year 2024, compared to $83 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Brent price was $75 per barrel. The WTI price  averaged  $76  per  barrel  for  the  full-year  2024,  compared  to  $78  in  2023. As  of  mid-February  2025,  the  WTI  price  was  $71  per  barrel.  The  majority  of  the company's equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price averaged $2.25 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the full-year 2024, compared to $2.56 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Henry Hub price was $4.42 per MCF. See page 47 for the company's U.S. and international average realizations for each of the past three years.\n\nCrude prices in 2024 were influenced by geopolitical conflict and OPEC+ supply restraint, which was offset by factors such as non-OPEC supply growth and slowing demand growth.\n\nIn  contrast  to  price  movements  in  the  global  market  for  crude  oil,  prices  for  natural  gas  are  also  impacted  by  regional  supply  and  demand  and  infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, lower Henry Hub prices were driven by high storage levels, strong production, and delayed starts to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects.\n\nOutside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company's long-term contract prices for LNG  are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG  offtake from the operated Australian LNG  projects is committed under binding longterm contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market.\n\nProduction The company's worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2024 was 3.3 million barrels per day, 7 percent higher than in 2023 primarily due to the full-year of legacy PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) production and growth in the Permian Basin. About 20 percent of the company's net oil-equivalent production in 2024 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the Republic of Congo.\n\nThe company estimates its net oil-equivalent production in 2025 to increase six to eight percent over 2024, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $70 per barrel and excluding expected asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greaterthan-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; acquisition and divestment of assets; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and  natural  gas  in  various  markets;  weather  conditions  that  may  shut  in  production;  civil  unrest;  changing  geopolitics;  delays  in  completion  of  maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations.

Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and  regional  supply-and-demand  balance  for  refined  products  and  petrochemicals,  and  by  changes  in  the  price  of  crude  oil,  other  refinery  and  petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\n\nOther factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company's shipping operations, which are driven by the industry's demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company's control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe company's most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. The company is also one of the largest renewable fuels producers in the United States.\n\nRefer to the 'Results of Operations' section on page 44 for additional discussion of the company's downstream operations.\n\nAll Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' Canadian operations contributed 8% to consolidated liquids production in 2021, while the Alaska segment contributed a larger share at 19%. Despite a 1 MBOED production decline in Alaska due to normal field decline, the segment achieved $1,386 million in earnings, driven by higher crude oil prices and reduced exploration expenses, including the absence of a $648 million after-tax impairment from the prior year. The earnings were partially offset by higher taxes due to increased crude oil prices. The production decline was mitigated by the absence of curtailments, improved production at Western North Slope assets, and new wells coming online. This suggests that while Alaska had a larger production footprint and higher earnings impact, it also faced operational challenges that were partially offset by strategic and market-driven improvements.",

This apparent contradiction is explained by the acquisition of an additional working interest in the Kuparuk River Unit and Prudhoe Bay Unit, which added approximately five MBOED of production in November and December 2024. While overall production declined due to normal field decline, the additional working interest acquisition contributed to reserves growth and partially offset the production decline trend.",

      "question": "How does Chevron's 5.1% discount rate assumption for 'Other Benefits' obligations in 2023 relate to the projected $154 million payment for these benefits in 2024, considering the role of actuarial assumptions in long-term benefit calculations?",
      "answer": "Chevron's 5.1% discount rate assumption for 'Other Benefits' obligations in 2023 is a key actuarial input used to calculate the present value of future benefit payments, such as the projected $154 million payment for these benefits in 2024. The discount rate directly affects the valuation of these liabilities, as a higher rate reduces the present value of future obligations. The $154 million 2024 payment represents a specific year's estimated outflow based on these actuarial assumptions, which include the discount rate and other factors like compensation increases and return on plan assets. While the filing doesn't explicitly state how the 5.1% rate influenced the $154 million projection, the relationship is inherent in the actuarial valuation methodology described in the disclosures.",

      "question": "How does XOM's historical decline in liquids production from divestments inform its forward-looking strategic guidance on asset management?",
      "answer": "XOM's historical data from page 62 shows that liquids production declined by 60 thousand barrels per day in 2021 and 37 thousand barrels per day in 2020, with divestments cited as a key contributing factor in both years. This consistent reduction in production volume due to divestments indicates a deliberate strategic shift in asset portfolio management. On page 52, the company\u2019s forward-looking statements highlight that future decisions on divestments will depend on factors like regulatory approval, market conditions, and strategic alignment. The historical pattern of divestment-driven production declines appears to be a precursor to the company's broader strategic guidance, suggesting that divestments are not isolated events but part of a calculated approach to reshape the asset base in line with long-term financial and operational goals.",

Actual future results, including future energy demand and mix; financial and operating performance; realized price and margins; dividends and shareholder  returns,  including  the  timing  and  amounts  of  share  repurchases;  volume  growth;  project  plans,  timing,  costs,  and capacities;  capital  expenditures,  including  lower-emissions  and  environmental  expenditures;  cost  reductions  and  structural  cost savings; integration benefits; emission intensity and absolute emissions reductions; achievement of ambitions to reach Scope 1 and Scope 2 net-zero from operated assets by 2050, to reduce methane emissions and flaring, or to complete major asset emission reduction  roadmaps;  implementation  and  outcomes  of  carbon  capture  and  storage  projects  and  infrastructure,  renewable  fuel projects,  blue  hydrogen  projects,  and  other  technology  efforts;  the  impact  of  new  technologies  on  society  and  industry;  capital expenditures  and  mix;  investment  returns;  accounting  and  financial  reporting  effects  resulting  from  market  or  regulatory developments and ExxonMobil's responsive actions, including potential impairment charges; and the outcome of litigation and tax contingencies,  could  differ  materially  due  to  a  number  of  factors.  These  include  global  or  regional  changes  in  the  supply  and demand for oil, natural gas, petrochemicals, and feedstocks and other market or economic conditions that impact demand, prices and differentials; policy and consumer support for lower-emission products and technologies in different jurisdictions; the impact of company actions to protect the health and safety of employees, vendors, customers, and communities; actions of competitors and commercial counterparties; the ability to access short- and long-term debt markets on a timely and affordable basis; the severity, length and ultimate impact of COVID-19 variants and government responses on people and economies; reservoir performance; the outcome  of  exploration  projects  and  timely  completion  of  development  and  construction  projects;  regulatory  actions  targeting public companies in the oil and gas industry; changes in local, national, or international law, taxes, regulation or policies affecting our business, including environmental regulations and timely granting of governmental permits; war, trade agreements and patterns, shipping blockades or harassment, and other political or security disturbances; the pace of regional and global economic recovery from  the  pandemic  and  the  occurrence  and  severity  of  future  outbreaks;  opportunities  for  and  regulatory  approval  of  potential investments or divestments; the actions of competitors; the capture of efficiencies within and between business lines and the ability to  maintain  near-term  cost  reductions  as  ongoing  efficiencies  while  maintaining  future  competitive  positioning;  unforeseen technical or operating difficulties; the development and competitiveness of alternative energy and emission reduction technologies; the results of research programs; the ability to bring new technologies to commercial scale on a cost-competitive basis; general economic conditions including the occurrence and duration of economic recessions; and other factors discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nEnergy demand models are forward-looking by nature and aim to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply ExxonMobil views  any  particular  scenario  as  likely  to  occur.  In  addition,  energy  demand  scenarios  require  assumptions  on  a  variety  of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For  example,  the  IEA  describes  its  NZE  scenario  as  extremely  challenging,  requiring  unprecedented  innovation,  unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use by ExxonMobil is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of  ExxonMobil's  separate  planning  process,  but  may  be  secondarily  tested  for  robustness  or  resiliency  against  different assumptions, including against various scenarios. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for,  and  production  of,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  manufacture,  trade,  transport  and  sale  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. ExxonMobil's operating segments are Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical. Where  applicable  ExxonMobil  voluntarily  discloses  additional  U.S.,  Non-U.S.  and  regional  splits  to  help  investors  better understand the company's operations.\n\nIn  January 2022, the Corporation announced that effective April 2022 it is streamlining its business structure by combining the Chemical and Downstream businesses. The company will be organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions will consist of Energy Products, Specialty Products and Chemical Products. Low Carbon Solutions will continue to be included in Corporate and Financing. The businesses will  be  supported  by  a  combined  technology  organization,  and  other  centralized  service-delivery  groups,  building  on  the establishment of a worldwide major projects organization in 2019.",

However, the Foreign Currency Effects line item on page 103 shows a $520 million gain for 2024, contrasting with the $588 million loss in 2023. This implies that the favorable swing cited in the Net Charges section is derived from the reversal of the prior-year loss into a current-year gain, contributing positively to Net Charges despite the overall increase in costs.

      "question": "Given the 5 MBOED decline in Alaska's overall production, yet a 4 MMcfD increase in natural gas output, what does this divergence suggest about ConocoPhillips' Alaska production strategy and its potential impact on segment profitability?",
      "answer": "The 5 MBOED decline in Alaska's overall production, primarily due to normal field decline, contrasts with a 4 MMcfD increase in natural gas production (from 34 to 38 MMcfD), which suggests a strategic shift or operational focus toward natural gas development. This is further supported by the mention of new wells coming online at the Western North Slope and Greater Kuparuk Area assets, indicating targeted investment in gas-rich areas. Despite the overall production decline, the Alaska segment still reported $1.778 billion in earnings for 2023, which were positively impacted by lower taxes other than income taxes. This implies that the shift toward natural gas may be helping to stabilize or even enhance segment profitability despite broader production declines, assuming natural gas prices remain supportive.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(page_133) \u2192 Alaska Segment: Alaska contributed 15% of consolidated liquids production and 2% of consolidated natural gas production in 2023, with a 5 MBOED decline in average production compared to 2022 due to normal field decline.",
        "Hop 2: Alaska Segment \u2192 Natural Gas Production: New wells at Western North Slope and Greater Kuparuk Area assets contributed to an increase in natural gas output, rising from 34 to 38 MMcfD in 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Natural Gas Production \u2190 COP(page_151): Natural gas production in Alaska increased by 4 MMcfD year-over-year, even as overall production declined, suggesting a strategic shift toward natural gas development."

      "question": "How does CVX's use of a 5.1% discount rate for Other Benefits in 2023 relate to the projected decrease in Other Benefits payments from 2024 to 2025, and what might this imply about the company's long-term liability assumptions?",
      "answer": "CVX applied a 5.1% discount rate to calculate the 2023 obligation for Other Benefits, reflecting assumptions about future interest rates and economic conditions. Despite this rate being higher than the 5.3% used in 2022, the company projects a decrease in Other Benefits payments from $154 million in 2024 to $151 million in 2025. This decline suggests that the company may be assuming a reduction in the number of beneficiaries, lower benefit payouts, or more favorable cost trends over time, even as the discount rate has decreased, which would typically increase liability estimates. The interplay between the discount rate assumption and the projected cash flows indicates a nuanced liability modeling approach that balances actuarial assumptions with expected benefit utilization patterns.",

      "answer": "The increase in the Lower 48 segment\u2019s total average production by 85 MBOED in 2024, driven by new wells and the Marathon Oil acquisition, did not translate into higher earnings due to several offsetting factors. Despite the production growth and higher volumes contributing $1,003 million in revenue, earnings declined from $6,461 million in 2023 to $5,175 million in 2024. This was primarily due to lower commodity prices, which reduced revenues by $904 million, and higher operating costs, including a $562 million increase in DD&A driven by higher production and acquisition-related impacts, as well as $431 million in higher production and operating expenses. These cost increases, combined with the absence of a $100 million gain from a prior-year divestiture, outweighed the revenue benefits from higher volumes, resulting in a net decline in segment earnings.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "answer": "COP's Canadian operations contributed 7% of consolidated liquids production in 2023, highlighting the company's diversified production base. In comparison, the Alaska segment contributed 15% of consolidated liquids production, a significantly larger share, despite reporting earnings of $1,778 million, which were lower than the previous year due to lower realized crude oil prices and higher operating expenses. The Alaska segment's strategic focus on crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas aligns with its role as a major contributor to liquids production. However, its earnings performance underscores the operational challenges faced in 2023, including higher DD&A expenses and production decline, which were partially offset by new wells coming online. This contrast between production contribution and earnings illustrates the differing dynamics between operational output and financial performance within the segment.",

      "answer": "Chevron's 'Other Benefits' liability for 2029\u20132033 is projected at $716 million, up from $154 million in 2024, indicating a long-term upward trend in benefit obligations. This increase aligns with the 5.1% discount rate assumption used in 2023 for determining benefit obligations, which was higher than the 2022 rate of 5.3%. A higher discount rate typically reduces the present value of future liabilities, yet despite this, the projected liability for 'Other Benefits' still rises significantly over time. This suggests that rising benefit costs are outpacing the discounting effect, signaling potential long-term financial pressure on Chevron\u2019s benefits programs.",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "Chevron reports that 1,423 gross oil wells are accounted for under the non-equity method, with a corresponding net well count of 480. Since net wells represent Chevron's ownership interest in gross wells, the difference between 1,423 gross and 480 net wells implies a low average ownership percentage (~33.7%) in these non-equity method wells.

      "answer": "Chevron reported in 2024 that the Bibiyana Field in Bangladesh contributed to a 1.8 TCF increase in Asia's natural gas proved reserves in 2022, and further reservoir performance in Bangladesh was a key factor in a 481 BCF increase in 2023. Despite this positive reserve growth, the company also disclosed on another page that recent political unrest in Bangladesh could impact the Bibiyana Field's future operations, although no operational impact had been observed as of the filing. This juxtaposition suggests that while Chevron is experiencing reserve growth from the Bibiyana Field, it is also aware of and factoring in geopolitical risks that could affect future production and reserve valuations, indicating a cautious, risk-adjusted approach to its upstream strategy in the region.",

Recent political unrest in the country has not impacted the company's operations to date; however, the future impacts, if any, on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nCommodity Prices The following chart shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $81 per barrel for the full-year 2024, compared to $83 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Brent price was $75 per barrel. The WTI price  averaged  $76  per  barrel  for  the  full-year  2024,  compared  to  $78  in  2023. As  of  mid-February  2025,  the  WTI  price  was  $71  per  barrel.  The  majority  of  the company's equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark. The U.S. Henry Hub natural gas price averaged $2.25 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) for the full-year 2024, compared to $2.56 in 2023. As of mid-February 2025, the Henry Hub price was $4.42 per MCF. See page 47 for the company's U.S. and international average realizations for each of the past three years.\n\nCrude prices in 2024 were influenced by geopolitical conflict and OPEC+ supply restraint, which was offset by factors such as non-OPEC supply growth and slowing demand growth.\n\nIn  contrast  to  price  movements  in  the  global  market  for  crude  oil,  prices  for  natural  gas  are  also  impacted  by  regional  supply  and  demand  and  infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, lower Henry Hub prices were driven by high storage levels, strong production, and delayed starts to liquefied natural gas (LNG) export projects.\n\nOutside the United States, prices for natural gas also depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company's long-term contract prices for LNG  are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG  offtake from the operated Australian LNG  projects is committed under binding longterm contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market.\n\nProduction The company's worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2024 was 3.3 million barrels per day, 7 percent higher than in 2023 primarily due to the full-year of legacy PDC Energy, Inc. (PDC) production and growth in the Permian Basin. About 20 percent of the company's net oil-equivalent production in 2024 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the Republic of Congo.\n\nThe company estimates its net oil-equivalent production in 2025 to increase six to eight percent over 2024, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $70 per barrel and excluding expected asset sales. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greaterthan-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; acquisition and divestment of assets; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and  natural  gas  in  various  markets;  weather  conditions  that  may  shut  in  production;  civil  unrest;  changing  geopolitics;  delays  in  completion  of  maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations.

These charges are cited on page 47 as a component of higher operating expenses, while page 45 explicitly links severance charges to the rise in net charges. This dual impact highlights that cost pressures are not only affecting operational line items but are also feeding into broader corporate-level financial obligations, despite partial offsets like foreign currency effects. The connection suggests that workforce restructuring is a material cost driver across different financial categories.",

      "answer": "Chevron's 'All Other' segment includes insurance operations among other non-core corporate functions. In 2024, the company announced a $2-3 billion structural cost reduction initiative by 2026, resulting in a $980 million charge, with $274 million specifically attributed to employee reductions within 'All Other.' This indicates that insurance operations, as part of this segment, are subject to restructuring efforts aimed at reducing overhead and streamlining corporate functions. The decision to include insurance operations within 'All Other' rather than a dedicated segment suggests that it is not a core revenue-generating activity but rather a supporting function, making it a target for cost optimization.",

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil acknowledges that proved reserves estimates are sensitive to price volatility, which can significantly affect the timing and amount of recoverable reserves. This sensitivity is directly illustrated at Kearl, where approximately 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen were added to proved reserves in 2021 due to an improved SEC price basis compared to 2020. Kearl, in which ExxonMobil holds a majority stake through its ownership in Imperial Oil Limited and ExxonMobil Canada Properties, demonstrates both the opportunity and risk associated with oil sands projects\u2014where higher commodity prices enable reserve additions and production, but lower prices could constrain future capital spending and reserve recognition. Thus, the addition of reserves at Kearl reflects a short-term opportunity driven by favorable pricing, but also underscores the longer-term risk exposure tied to proved reserves' sensitivity to market conditions.",

However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

      "answer": "The addition of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen to proved reserves at Kearl in 2021, driven by an improved SEC price basis, highlights a significant increase in resource confidence under favorable pricing conditions. However, this optimism is tempered by the broader context in the 10-K that outlines several factors that could negatively impact the timing and recovery of proved reserves, including delays in project start-ups, operational outages, regulatory changes, and price volatility. These external and internal risks suggest that while the reserves were increased due to favorable market conditions, their actual production could be delayed or reduced if adverse conditions arise, particularly affecting large-scale, capital-intensive projects like Kearl.",

However, the Corporation  operates  its  business  with  the  same  view  of  equity  company  reserves  as  it  has  for  reserves  from  consolidated subsidiaries.\n\nThe Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; performance of enhanced oil recovery projects; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of capital investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and other factors described in Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nThe estimation  of  proved  reserves,  which  is  based  on  the  requirement  of  reasonable  certainty,  is  an  ongoing  process  based  on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments and detailed analysis of well and reservoir information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures. Furthermore, the Corporation only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management toward the development of the reserves. Although the Corporation is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, and significant changes in crude oil and natural gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the Corporation's capital spending and also impact our partners' capacity to fund their share of joint projects.\n\n## B. Technologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions in 2021\n\nAdditions to ExxonMobil's proved reserves in 2021 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well-established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results.\n\nData used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs,  reservoir  core  samples,  fluid  samples,  static  and  dynamic  pressure  information,  production  test  data,  and  surveillance  and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements including high-quality  3-D  and  4-D  seismic  data,  calibrated  with  available  well  control  information.  The  tools  used  to  interpret  the  data included seismic processing software, reservoir modeling and simulation software, and data analysis packages.\n\nIn some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates.",

This production impact reflects the tangible outcome of asset sales during that year. In the forward-looking statements section, management frames divestments as strategic actions aimed at maintaining 'near-term cost reductions as ongoing efficiencies while maintaining future competitive positioning.' This suggests that despite the short-term production decline from divestments, management views these actions as necessary to preserve long-term capital discipline and operational efficiency. The reconciliation lies in understanding that the production drop is a trade-off for improved financial positioning, which aligns with management's stated objective of maintaining competitiveness in a volatile energy market.",

Risk Factors.\n\nEnergy demand models are forward-looking by nature and aim to replicate system dynamics of the global energy system, requiring simplifications. The reference to any scenario in this report, including any potential net-zero scenarios, does not imply ExxonMobil views  any  particular  scenario  as  likely  to  occur.  In  addition,  energy  demand  scenarios  require  assumptions  on  a  variety  of parameters. As such, the outcome of any given scenario using an energy demand model comes with a high degree of uncertainty. For  example,  the  IEA  describes  its  NZE  scenario  as  extremely  challenging,  requiring  unprecedented  innovation,  unprecedented international cooperation and sustained support and participation from consumers. Third-party scenarios discussed in this report reflect the modeling assumptions and outputs of their respective authors, not ExxonMobil, and their use by ExxonMobil is not an endorsement by ExxonMobil of their underlying assumptions, likelihood or probability. Investment decisions are made on the basis of  ExxonMobil's  separate  planning  process,  but  may  be  secondarily  tested  for  robustness  or  resiliency  against  different assumptions, including against various scenarios. Any use of the modeling of a third-party organization within this report does not constitute or imply an endorsement by ExxonMobil of any or all of the positions or activities of such organization.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of ExxonMobil's financial results, as well as the accompanying financial statements and related notes to consolidated financial statements to which they refer, are the responsibility of the management of Exxon Mobil Corporation. The Corporation's accounting and financial reporting fairly reflect its integrated business model involving exploration for,  and  production  of,  crude  oil  and  natural  gas,  manufacture,  trade,  transport  and  sale  of  crude  oil,  natural  gas,  petroleum products, petrochemicals and a wide variety of specialty products; and pursuit of lower-emission business opportunities including carbon capture and storage, hydrogen, and biofuels. ExxonMobil's operating segments are Upstream, Downstream, and Chemical. Where  applicable  ExxonMobil  voluntarily  discloses  additional  U.S.,  Non-U.S.  and  regional  splits  to  help  investors  better understand the company's operations.\n\nIn  January 2022, the Corporation announced that effective April 2022 it is streamlining its business structure by combining the Chemical and Downstream businesses. The company will be organized along three businesses - Upstream, Product Solutions, and Low Carbon Solutions, aligning along market-focused value chains. Product Solutions will consist of Energy Products, Specialty Products and Chemical Products. Low Carbon Solutions will continue to be included in Corporate and Financing. The businesses will  be  supported  by  a  combined  technology  organization,  and  other  centralized  service-delivery  groups,  building  on  the establishment of a worldwide major projects organization in 2019.",

      "question": "How does the impact of divestments on 2021 natural gas production volumes relate to ExxonMobil's long-term proved natural gas reserves reporting under SEC rules, particularly in light of price-driven reserve revisions?",
      "answer": "In 2021, ExxonMobil reported that natural gas production available for sale increased by 66 million cubic feet per day, but this growth was partly offset by divestments. At the same time, the company's proved reserves reporting under SEC rules showed upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels at Cold Lake, primarily driven by improved prices. This suggests that while divestments reduced short-term production volumes, higher oil prices positively influenced long-term reserve estimates, highlighting a tension between near-term asset reduction strategies and the economic revaluation of reserves under SEC-mandated price calculations.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\n\nIn fourth quarter 2024, the company announced plans to achieve $2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including expanded use of global capability centers. In relation to these efforts, the company recognized a restructuring charge of $715 million after tax in fourth quarter 2024, with associated cash outflows anticipated over the next two years. The company continues to evaluate incremental cost reduction opportunities and could incur additional restructuring and reorganization charges in future periods. This will have an impact on the company's pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB) plans; however, the impact is not yet estimable and any impacts will be recognized in future periods.\n\nEarnings trends for the company's major business areas are described as follows:\n\nUpstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. These prices are subject to external factors over  which  the  company  has  no  control,  including  product  demand  connected  with  global  economic  conditions,  industry  production  and  inventory  levels, technology  advancements,  production  quotas  or  other  actions  imposed  by  OPEC+  countries,  actions  of  regulators,  weather-related  damage  and  disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company's control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company's production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\n\nThe longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company's ability to efficiently find, acquire and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn April 2024, Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) achieved start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and at year-end 2024, all four pressure boost facility compressors are online and all metering stations have been converted to low pressure. In January 2025, TCO started oil production at its Future G rowth Project, which is ex pected to contribute to higher free cash flow.\n\nChevron has interests in V enezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in V enezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received G eneral License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in V enezuela subject to certain limitations, and the company continues such activities under this G eneral License. The financial results for Chevron's business in V enezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company's results. Crude oil liftings in V enezuela started in first quarter 2023, which have positively impacted the company's results. The company's independent affiliates have continued to maintain safe and reliable operations; however, future impact on results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nChevron maintains an equity interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) which provides a primary export route for Tengiz field production in Kazakhstan. An adverse  event  or  incident  affecting  CPC  operations,  which  CPC  has  ex perienced  from  time  to  time,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Tengiz  field  and  the company's results of operations and financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions and the February 2025 drone attack on the CPC pumping station, remain uncertain.\n\nOther governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or ex port crude in the region around Russia.\n\nChevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar field in Israel. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and various regional adversaries, the company continues to maintain safe and reliable operations while meeting its contractual commitments. The company continues to monitor the ongoing conflict in the region and any future impacts on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.",

      "question": "How can ConocoPhillips report both a $766M increase in DD&A expenses and a $1.29B decrease in taxes other than income taxes, when both attribute some change to higher production volumes?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips reports in different sections of its 10-K that both DD&A expenses and taxes other than income taxes are influenced by production volumes, but with opposing directional impacts. On page 43, the company notes that DD&A increased by $766 million primarily due to higher rates from reserve revisions driven by higher operating costs and overall production volumes. Meanwhile, on page 42, taxes other than income taxes decreased by $1,290 million, with the decline attributed to lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher production volumes. The key distinction lies in the moderating factors: while higher production volumes contribute to increased DD&A through reserve revisions and operating costs, the same production volumes only partially offset the downward pressure on taxes from lower commodity prices. This dual effect illustrates how production growth can simultaneously drive up capital-related expenses while reducing per-unit tax burdens in a lower price environment.",

        "Hop 1: COP(page_42) \u2192 Lower Taxes Other Than Income Taxes: The company reports a $1,290 million decrease in taxes other than income taxes, primarily driven by lower commodity prices, partially offset by higher production volumes.",

        "Hop 3: Higher Production Volumes \u2190 COP(page_43): The income statement analysis on page 43 attributes a $766 million increase in DD&A expenses to higher production volumes and reserve revisions from higher operating costs."

In comparison, foreign currency effects also had a negative impact on corporate and other activities, with an unfavorable swing of $206 million, which was a key factor in the overall net charges decrease being lower than expected. This shows that foreign currency effects were a material challenge across different business segments, though the impact was more pronounced in the international downstream segment.

      "answer": "In 2021, the Lower 48 segment experienced a decline in the fair value of certain noncore assets, which were written down to reflect their estimated future cash flows based on production outlook, pricing assumptions, and discount rates. Despite this earlier impairment, the Lower 48 segment contributed 76% of COP's consolidated natural gas production in 2023, with natural gas production volumes reaching 1,457 million cubic feet daily\u2014up from 1,402 in 2022 and 1,340 in 2021. This apparent contradiction suggests that while certain noncore assets were impaired due to unfavorable economics in 2021, the broader Lower 48 operations remained productive and were able to drive growth in natural gas output in subsequent years, likely due to improved development programs and higher well productivity in key basins such as the Delaware, Midland, Eagle Ford, and Bakken.

      "answer": "COP's Alaska operations contributed 2% of the company's consolidated natural gas production in 2023, while the Europe, Middle East and North Africa (EMEA) segment contributed 16% of consolidated natural gas production. This indicates that the EMEA region has a significantly larger impact on COP's natural gas portfolio compared to Alaska. Given that EMEA accounts for a much higher proportion of natural gas output, it suggests that this region is more strategically important for COP's gas production, despite Alaska's prominence in crude oil production.",

This decline is based on actuarial projections that incorporate assumptions such as the 5.1% discount rate used in 2023.

      "answer": "The acquisition of Marathon Oil added $13.2 billion in provisional fair value of proved oil and gas properties to the Lower 48 segment, which is consistent with the segment's dominant role in the company's liquids production, contributing 63% of the total. This acquisition also contributed to an 85 MBOED increase in total average production in 2024. In contrast, the Europe, Middle East and North Africa segment, which contributes only 9% to liquids production, underscores the strategic emphasis on the Lower 48 as the core growth engine for liquids output.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "The Lower 48 segment contributed 63% of COP's consolidated liquids production in 2024 and saw a production increase of 85 MBOED, largely due to the Marathon Oil acquisition, which added approximately 334 MBOED in December alone. However, the unaudited provisional valuation of unproved oil and gas properties acquired from Marathon Oil remains incomplete, with $10.8 billion in unproved properties still unallocated as of the 10-K filing. Given the segment's outsized role in COP's production profile and the ongoing uncertainty around the valuation of these newly acquired unproved properties, there is material financial risk related to potential overvaluation or misclassification of reserves. This could affect future impairment charges, asset carrying values, and ultimately earnings stability for the company\u2019s most productive segment.",

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's internal control framework for proved reserves estimation, managed by the Global Reserves and Resources Group, reconcile with the financial impact of reserve revisions on upstream asset depreciation rates under the unit-of-production method?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's Global Reserves and Resources Group, which has an average technical experience of over 15 years and includes professionals trained in engineering and geology, oversees the reserves estimation process to ensure compliance with SEC rules and maintains the integrity of the reserves database through strict access controls and annual internal audits. This oversight ensures that proved reserves are estimated with reasonable certainty and are based on rigorous technical evaluations and commercial assessments. However, the financial impact of these proved reserves on upstream asset depreciation is significant, as the unit-of-production depreciation method relies directly on reserve volume estimates. Revisions to proved reserves\u2014whether due to changes in reservoir performance, regulatory conditions, or oil and gas prices\u2014can materially affect depreciation rates. For example, a substantial de-booking of reserves could lead to a reassessment of depreciation methods to ensure equitable cost allocation over the asset's life, even shifting to straight-line depreciation in limited cases. Thus, the technical and procedural rigor applied by the Global Reserves and Resources Group directly influences the financial treatment of upstream assets in ExxonMobil's financial statements.",

      "answer": "ExxonMobil's 2024 proved undeveloped reserves include 231 billion cubic feet of natural gas in the Other Americas region, as disclosed on page 10. This figure is part of the broader category of natural gas reserves, which are reported under SEC rules requiring reserves to be calculated using the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the preceding 12-month period. On page 127, the company explains that proved undeveloped reserves require significant new investments for recovery and that revisions to reserves can result from changes in pricing assumptions. Therefore, the 231 billion cubic feet of undeveloped natural gas reserves in Other Americas are subject to economic producibility assessments under current pricing conditions, which directly influence their inclusion in the company's standardized measure of discounted net cash flows and long-term development planning.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "The $5.0 billion in proceeds from asset sales in 2024, as reported in the cash flow section, is distinct from but related to the $415 million gain on sale of assets included in the Identified Items table. While the proceeds represent the total cash received from asset sales, the $415 million gain reflects the accounting treatment of those sales\u2014specifically, the difference between the sale price and the book value of the divested assets. This suggests that while asset sales contributed meaningfully to liquidity (as shown in cash flows), their direct earnings impact was relatively modest compared to the broader scale of ExxonMobil's operations. The relationship highlights how asset divestitures can simultaneously enhance liquidity while contributing positively\u2014though selectively\u2014to non-GAAP earnings adjustments under Identified Items.",

          "chunk_text": "\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $23.2 billion at the end of 2024, down $8.4 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2024 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $35.1 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $23.4 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $5.0 billion, other investing activities of $1.9 billion, and cash acquired from mergers and acquisitions of $0.8 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions  to  property,  plant  and  equipment  of  $24.3  billion;  dividends  to  shareholders  of  $16.7  billion;  the  purchase  of  Ex x onMobil  stock  of  $19.6  billion; debt repayment of $5.9 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.3 billion; and an increase in working capital of $1.8 billion.\n\nTotal cash and cash equivalents were $31.6 billion at the end of 2023, up $1.9 billion from the prior year. The major sources of funds in 2023 were net income including noncontrolling interests of $37.4 billion, the adjustment for the noncash provision of $20.6 billion for depreciation and depletion, proceeds from asset sales of $4.1 billion, and other investing activities of $1.6 billion. The major uses of funds included spending for additions to property, plant and equipment of $21.9 billion; dividends to shareholders of $14.9 billion; the purchase of ExxonMobil stock of $17.7 billion; additional investments and advances of $3.0 billion; and a change in working capital of $4.3 billion.\n\nThe Corporation has access to significant capacity of long-term and short-term liquidity. Internally generated funds are expected to cover the majority of financial requirements, supplemented by long-term and short-term debt. On December 31, 2024, the Corporation had undrawn short-term committed lines of credit of $0.2 billion and undrawn long-term lines of credit of $1.3 billion.\n\nTo support cash flows in future periods, the Corporation will need to continually find or acquire and develop new fields, and continue to develop and apply new technologies and recovery processes to existing fields, in order to maintain or increase production. After a period of production at plateau rates, it is the nature of oil and gas fields to eventually produce at declining rates for the remainder of their economic life. Decline rates can vary widely by individual field due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the type of reservoir, fluid properties, recovery mechanisms, work activity, and age of the field. In particular, the Corporation's key tight-oil plays have higher initial decline rates which tend to moderate over time. Furthermore, the Corporation's net interest in production for individual fields can vary with price and the impact of fiscal and commercial terms.\n\nThe Corporation has long been successful at mitigating the effects of natural field decline through disciplined investments in quality opportunities and project execution. The Corporation anticipates several projects will come online over the next few years providing additional production capacity. However, actual volumes will vary from year to year due to the timing of individual project start-ups; operational outages; reservoir performance; regulatory changes; the impact of fiscal and commercial terms; asset sales; weather events; price effects on production sharing contracts; changes in the amount and timing of investments that may vary depending on the oil and gas price environment; and international trade patterns and relations. The Corporation's cash flows are also highly dependent on crude oil and natural gas prices. Please refer to Item 1A for a more complete discussion of risks.\n\nThe Corporation's financial strength enables it to make large, long-term capital expenditures.  Cash  Capex in 2024 was $25.6 billion, reflecting the  Corporation's continued active investment program, and includes plans to invest in the range of $27 billion to $29 billion in 2025 (see the Cash Capital Expenditures section for more details).\n\nActual spending could vary depending on the progress of individual projects and property acquisitions.  The  Corporation has a large and diverse portfolio of development  projects  and  exploration  opportunities,  which  helps  mitigate  the  overall  political  and  technical  risks  of  the  Corporation's  Upstream  segment  and associated cash flow. Further, due to its financial strength and diverse portfolio of opportunities, the risk associated with failure or delay of any single project would not have a significant impact on the Corporation's liquidity or ability to generate sufficient cash flows for operations and its fix ed commitments.",

      "answer": "In 2024, ExxonMobil reported 176 billion cubic feet of proved developed natural gas reserves and 231 billion cubic feet of proved undeveloped reserves in the Other Americas region, which includes North America. This means that approximately 56.9% of the region's natural gas reserves are classified as proved undeveloped. According to the SEC's definitions incorporated in the filing, proved undeveloped reserves are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells requiring significant expenditures for recompletion. This high proportion of proved undeveloped reserves indicates that ExxonMobil's development strategy for North American natural gas relies heavily on future capital investment to bring these reserves into production, aligning with the company's long-term planning and resource allocation decisions.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

      "answer": "The Lower 48 segment experienced a $562 million increase in DD&A expenses in 2024, with $139 million of that directly attributed to the Marathon Oil acquisition. This increase comes on top of an already substantial 2022 DD&A cost base of $4,843 million for the same segment. The acquisition added significant new assets and production volume (334 MBOED in December 2024), which directly contributed to the higher DD&A costs in 2024. This suggests that the acquisition has materially increased the company\u2019s depreciation, depletion, and amortization burden in the Lower 48, reflecting both the scale of the acquired assets and the associated capital investment. The comparison highlights the growing cost pressures in the segment driven by both operational expansion and acquisition activity.",

          "chunk_text": "Description of the Matter\n\nHow We Addressed the Matter in Our Audit\n\n## Valuation and recognition of proved and unproved oil and gas properties acquired in a business combination\n\nDuring 2024, the Company closed its acquisition of Marathon Oil Corporation resulting in the recognition of a provisional fair value of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within net properties, plants and equipment of $13.2 billion and $10.8 billion, respectively. As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

      "answer": "COP's Lower 48 segment contributed 64% of consolidated liquids production in 2023, reflecting its central role in the company's production growth driven by new wells in key basins like the Delaware and Midland Basins. However, despite this production contribution, the segment also experienced asset impairments due to declines in fair value of certain noncore assets below carrying values. These impairments, estimated using internal discounted cash flow models with assumptions around future production and pricing, highlight a divergence between operational performance and asset valuation. While the segment reported $6,461 million in earnings, this was down significantly from 2022 due to lower realized prices and higher DD&A expenses, suggesting that the impairment may reflect longer-term concerns about the economic viability of certain assets despite short-term production gains.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2022, 2023, and 2024.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations - prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes, as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables, are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by this report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month within such period. These reserves quantities are also used in calculating unit-of-production depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the evaluation or re-evaluation of (1) already available geologic, reservoir or production data, (2) new geologic, reservoir or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of reserves. Revisions can also result from significant changes in either development strategy or production equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved reserves include 100 percent of each majority-owned affiliate's participation in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's  ownership  percentage  of  the  proved reserves of equity companies, but exclude royalties and quantities due others. Natural gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the Company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2024 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 11 percent on an oil-equivalent basis (natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six  billion cubic feet per one million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2024 year-end proved reserves and 2023 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.6 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) and asset sales of 0.1 GOEB primarily in Nigeria. Additions to proved reserves include 2.3 GOEB related to the Pioneer acquisition, 1.9 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and G uyana, and net revisions of 0.6 GOEB primarily attributed to the United Arab Emirates, United States, Canada, and Guyana.\n\nThe changes between 2023 year-end proved reserves and 2022 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4 billion GOEB, asset sales of 0.2 GOEB primarily in the United States, and downward revisions of 0.4 GOEB. Additions to proved reserves include 1.1 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana and 0.2 GOEB related to the Denbury acquisition.\n\nThe changes between 2022 year-end proved reserves and 2021 year-end proved reserves include worldwide production of 1.4  GOEB, asset sales of 0.4  GOEB primarily in the United States, and other downward revisions of 1.2 GOEB including the impact of the Russia expropriation (0.2 GOEB). Additions to proved reserves include 0.7 GOEB from purchases in Asia and 1.4 GOEB from extensions and discoveries primarily in the United States and Guyana.",

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "answer": "The $24 billion in fair value assigned to proved and unproved oil and gas properties from the Marathon Oil acquisition significantly increases the Lower 48 segment's asset base and introduces greater sensitivity to commodity prices and reserve estimates, which could amplify earnings volatility. This is especially relevant given that the segment\u2019s production increased by 85 MBOED in 2024, partly due to the Marathon acquisition. Higher production volumes typically drive revenue growth, but the elevated DD&A costs\u2014already increased by $562 million in 2024 due to higher production and acquisition impacts\u2014will likely constrain earnings growth unless commodity prices rise or operating efficiencies offset the higher depreciation burden.",

        "Hop 2: Production \u2192 Lower 48 Segment: The Lower 48 segment experienced an 85 MBOED production increase in 2024, largely driven by new wells and the Marathon Oil acquisition, but this also led to higher DD&A and operating costs.",
        "Hop 3: Lower 48 Segment \u2190 COP(page_76): The audit note confirms that the Marathon acquisition added $24 billion in fair value to the Lower 48 segment (split between proved and unproved properties), which introduces significant estimation risk and sensitivity to earnings due to assumptions around reserves, commodity prices, and discount rates."

          "chunk_text": "\nThe Lower 48 segment consists of operations located in the contiguous U.S. and the Gulf of Mexico and commercial operations. During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "question": "How did ExxonMobil's 2021 divestments impact natural gas production in relation to its reserves adjustments under existing economic conditions, particularly regarding price effects?",
      "answer": "In 2021, ExxonMobil reported that natural gas production increased by 66 million cubic feet per day compared to the prior year, despite divestments reducing production volumes. This growth was attributed to higher demand, partially offset by divestments and the Groningen production limit. Meanwhile, on page 134, the company disclosed that improved prices during the year led to upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels at Cold Lake. These price-driven revisions increased the economic producibility of reserves under production sharing contracts, where higher prices typically result in lower required production volumes to achieve economic returns. Thus, while divestments reduced production volumes, the favorable pricing environment supported both increased production and upward reserves adjustments, illustrating how economic conditions can moderate the impact of asset sales on production and reserves dynamics.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

      "question": "How do ConocoPhillips' contingent payments in Canada, which are tied to WCS crude prices and expire in May 2022, influence their $7.2 billion 2022 capital allocation plan given the risk of asset impairments in that segment?",
      "answer": "ConocoPhillips' contingent payments in Canada\u2014calculated as $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD that the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel and set to expire in May 2022\u2014directly affect short-term cash flow and earnings volatility. These payments, recognized in the Canada segment and tied to commodity prices, provide upside potential in a high-price environment, which could temporarily boost capital availability. However, the company also acknowledges the risk of impairments in the Canada segment due to commodity price volatility and regulatory changes. Given the time-sensitive nature of these contingent payments and the potential for asset write-downs, the $7.2 billion 2022 capital plan must balance short-term cash inflow opportunities with long-term risk exposure, particularly in a region where both upside and downside scenarios are heavily influenced by crude price dynamics and fiscal policy.",

The unaudited pro forma financial information for the twelve-month period ending December 31, 2020 is a result of combining the consolidated income statement of ConocoPhillips with the results of Concho and the assets acquired from Shell.  The pro forma results do not include transaction-related costs, nor any cost savings anticipated as a result of the transactions.  The pro forma results include adjustments from Concho's historical results to reverse impairment expense of $ 10.5 billion and $1.9 billion related to oil and gas properties and goodwill, respectively. Other adjustments made relate primarily to DD&amp;A, which is based on the unit-of-production method, resulting from the purchase price allocated to properties, plants and equipment.  We believe the estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the relative effects of the transaction are  properly reflected.\n\n## Announced Acquisitions\n\nIn December 2021, we announced that we have notified Origin Energy that we are exercising our preemption right to purchase an additional 10 percent shareholding interest in APLNG from Origin Energy for $ 1.645 billion, which will be funded from cash on the balance sheet, before customary adjustments.  The effective date of the transaction will be July 1, 2020 with closing anticipated to occur in the first quarter of 2022 subject to Australian government approval.   See Note 4 and Note 7 .\n\n## Assets Sold\n\nIn 2020, we completed the sale of our Australia -West asset and operations.  The sales agreement entitled us to a $200 million payment upon a final investment decision (FID) of the Barossa development project.  On March 30, 2021, FID was announced and as such, we recognized a $200 million gain on disposition in the first quarter of 2021. The purchaser failed to pay the FID bonus when due.  We have commenced an arbitration proceeding against the purchaser to enforce our contractual right to the $ 200 million, plus interest accruing from the due date.  Results of operations related to this transaction are reflected in our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 11 .\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for approximately $250 million after customary adjustments, recognizing a before-tax gain on sale of approximately $58 million.  We also completed the sale of our noncore exploration interests in Argentina, recognizing a beforetax loss on disposition of $179 million.  Results of operations for Argentina were reported in our Other International segment.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded contingent payments of $ 369 million relating to previous dispositions.  The contingent payments are recorded as gain on disposition on our consolidated income statement and are reflected within our Canada and Lower 48 segments.  In our Canada segment, the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel .  The term for contingent payments in our Canada segment ends on May 16, 2022.  In our Lower 48 segment, the contingent payment, paid on an annual basis, is calculated monthly at $7 million per month in which the U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per MMBTU .  The term for contingent payments in our Lower 48 segment goes through 2023. No contingent payments were recorded in 2020.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell two subsidiaries holding our Indonesia assets and operations to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion, before customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2021.  The subsidiaries hold our 54 percent interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a35 percent shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company.  The net carrying value is approximately $0.4 billion, which consists primarily of PP&amp;E.  The assets met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter,  and as of December 31, 2021, we have reclassified $ 0.3 billion of PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and $ 0.1 billion of noncurrent ARO to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet.  The before-tax earnings associated with our Indonesia subsidiaries were $ 604 million, $394 million and $512 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively .  This transaction is expected to close in early 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other specific conditions precedent.  Results of operations for the subsidiaries to be sold are reported within our Asia Pacific segment.",

At times, our PP&amp;E and investments become impaired when, for example, commodity prices decline significantly for long periods of time, our reserve estimates are revised downward, a decision to dispose of an asset leads to a write-down to its fair value, or the current fair value of an investment is less than its carrying amount and the loss in value is deemed other than temporary.  As we optimize our assets in the future, it is reasonably possible we may incur future losses upon sale or impairment charges to long-lived assets used in operations, investments in nonconsolidated entities accounted for under the equity method, and unproved properties.  For more information on our impairments, see Note 6 and Note 7 .\n- Effective tax rate .  Our operations are in countries  with different tax rates  and fiscal structures. Accordingly, even in a stable commodity price and fiscal/regulatory environment, our overall effective tax rate can vary significantly  between periods based on the 'mix' of before-tax earnings within our global operations.\n- Fiscal and regulatory environment .  Our operations can be affected by changing economic, regulatory and political environments in the various countries in which we operate, including civil unrest or strained relationships with governments that may impact our operations or investments.  These changing environments could negatively impact our results of operations, and further changes to increase government fiscal take could have a negative impact on future operations.  Our management carefully considers the fiscal and regulatory environment when evaluating projects or determining the levels and locations of our activity.\n\n## Outlook\n\n## Production and Capital\n\n2022 operating plan capital budget is $7.2 billion.  The plan includes funding for ongoing development drilling programs, major projects, exploration and appraisal activities, base maintenance and $0.2 billion for projects to reduce the company's scope 1 and 2 emissions intensity and investme nts in several early-stage low-carbon opportunities that address end-use emissions.\n\nProduction guidance is 1.8 MMBOED in 2022 including Libya but excluding the impacts from the pending Indonesia disposition and acquisition of additional APLNG shareholding interest.  First quarter 2022 production is expected to be 1.75 MMBOED to 1.79 MMBOED.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nWe manage our operations through six operating segments, which are primarily defined by geographic region: Alaska; Lower 48; Canada; Europe, Middle East and North Africa; Asia Pacific; and Other International.\n\nCorporate and Other represents income and costs not directly associated with an operating segment, such as most interest expense, premiums incurred on the early retirement of debt, corporate overhead, certain technology activities, as well as licensing revenues.\n\nOur key performance indicators, shown in the statistical tables provided at the beginning of the operating segment sections that follow,  reflect results from our operations,  including commodity prices and production.",

      "answer": "The $369 million in contingent payments recorded in 2021 for prior dispositions in the Canada and Lower 48 segments reflects a partial financial recovery from assets that had previously been impaired due to declining fair values. In 2020 and 2021, the Lower 48 segment experienced significant noncore asset impairments, where carrying values were written down to fair value using internal discounted cash flow models that incorporated future production estimates, commodity price outlooks, operating costs, and discount rates. These impairments signaled a strategic decision to reposition the segment by divesting underperforming assets. The contingent payments, which are tied to commodity price thresholds (e.g., $3.20/MMBTU for U.S. Henry Hub in the Lower 48), represent upside participation in the future performance of those divested assets. This suggests that while COP took impairment charges to align asset values with market expectations, it retained some exposure to future commodity price strength through structured contingent payment agreements. Thus, the contingent payments are a strategic financial tool to monetize assets while preserving upside potential, directly informed by earlier impairment decisions based on conservative fair value assessments.",

On March 30, 2021, FID was announced and as such, we recognized a $200 million gain on disposition in the first quarter of 2021. The purchaser failed to pay the FID bonus when due.  We have commenced an arbitration proceeding against the purchaser to enforce our contractual right to the $ 200 million, plus interest accruing from the due date.  Results of operations related to this transaction are reflected in our Asia Pacific segment. See Note 11 .\n\nIn the second half of 2021, we sold our interests in certain noncore assets in our Lower 48 segment for approximately $250 million after customary adjustments, recognizing a before-tax gain on sale of approximately $58 million.  We also completed the sale of our noncore exploration interests in Argentina, recognizing a beforetax loss on disposition of $179 million.  Results of operations for Argentina were reported in our Other International segment.\n\nIn 2021, we recorded contingent payments of $ 369 million relating to previous dispositions.  The contingent payments are recorded as gain on disposition on our consolidated income statement and are reflected within our Canada and Lower 48 segments.  In our Canada segment, the contingent payment, calculated and paid on a quarterly basis, is $6 million CAD for every $1 CAD by which the WCS quarterly average crude price exceeds $52 CAD per barrel .  The term for contingent payments in our Canada segment ends on May 16, 2022.  In our Lower 48 segment, the contingent payment, paid on an annual basis, is calculated monthly at $7 million per month in which the U.S. Henry Hub price is at or above $3.20 per MMBTU .  The term for contingent payments in our Lower 48 segment goes through 2023. No contingent payments were recorded in 2020.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell two subsidiaries holding our Indonesia assets and operations to MedcoEnergi for $1.355 billion, before customary adjustments, with an effective date of January 1, 2021.  The subsidiaries hold our 54 percent interest in the Indonesia Corridor Block Production Sharing Contract (PSC) and a35 percent shareholding interest in the Transasia Pipeline Company.  The net carrying value is approximately $0.4 billion, which consists primarily of PP&amp;E.  The assets met the held for sale criteria in the fourth quarter,  and as of December 31, 2021, we have reclassified $ 0.3 billion of PP&amp;E to 'Prepaid expenses and other current assets' and $ 0.1 billion of noncurrent ARO to 'Other accruals' on our consolidated balance sheet.  The before-tax earnings associated with our Indonesia subsidiaries were $ 604 million, $394 million and $512 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively .  This transaction is expected to close in early 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other specific conditions precedent.  Results of operations for the subsidiaries to be sold are reported within our Asia Pacific segment.",

      "question": "How does Chevron's continued operational commitment to the Leviathan Field despite regional geopolitical risks align with the 1.8 TCF increase in natural gas proved reserves attributed to this field in 2022, and what might this suggest about the strategic importance of the field to Chevron's upstream portfolio?",
      "answer": "Chevron's 39.7% stake in the Leviathan Field, which is located in a geopolitically sensitive region, remains a key part of its upstream operations despite ongoing regional conflict. This is evidenced by the company's explicit mention of its continued safe and reliable operations in Israel amid regional hostilities (page 40). In 2022, the Leviathan Field contributed to a 1.8 TCF increase in Chevron\u2019s natural gas proved reserves in Asia, demonstrating its material impact on Chevron\u2019s reserve base (page 114). This alignment suggests that despite geopolitical uncertainty, Chevron views the Leviathan Field as a strategically valuable asset that enhances its long-term upstream position and reserve growth, especially in natural gas, a fuel often seen as a transitional energy source.",

Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\n\nIn fourth quarter 2024, the company announced plans to achieve $2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including expanded use of global capability centers. In relation to these efforts, the company recognized a restructuring charge of $715 million after tax in fourth quarter 2024, with associated cash outflows anticipated over the next two years. The company continues to evaluate incremental cost reduction opportunities and could incur additional restructuring and reorganization charges in future periods. This will have an impact on the company's pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB) plans; however, the impact is not yet estimable and any impacts will be recognized in future periods.\n\nEarnings trends for the company's major business areas are described as follows:\n\nUpstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. These prices are subject to external factors over  which  the  company  has  no  control,  including  product  demand  connected  with  global  economic  conditions,  industry  production  and  inventory  levels, technology  advancements,  production  quotas  or  other  actions  imposed  by  OPEC+  countries,  actions  of  regulators,  weather-related  damage  and  disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company's control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company's production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\n\nThe longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company's ability to efficiently find, acquire and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn April 2024, Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) achieved start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and at year-end 2024, all four pressure boost facility compressors are online and all metering stations have been converted to low pressure. In January 2025, TCO started oil production at its Future G rowth Project, which is ex pected to contribute to higher free cash flow.\n\nChevron has interests in V enezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in V enezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received G eneral License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in V enezuela subject to certain limitations, and the company continues such activities under this G eneral License. The financial results for Chevron's business in V enezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company's results. Crude oil liftings in V enezuela started in first quarter 2023, which have positively impacted the company's results. The company's independent affiliates have continued to maintain safe and reliable operations; however, future impact on results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nChevron maintains an equity interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) which provides a primary export route for Tengiz field production in Kazakhstan. An adverse  event  or  incident  affecting  CPC  operations,  which  CPC  has  ex perienced  from  time  to  time,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Tengiz  field  and  the company's results of operations and financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions and the February 2025 drone attack on the CPC pumping station, remain uncertain.\n\nOther governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or ex port crude in the region around Russia.\n\nChevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar field in Israel. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and various regional adversaries, the company continues to maintain safe and reliable operations while meeting its contractual commitments. The company continues to monitor the ongoing conflict in the region and any future impacts on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.",

This segment, as disclosed, includes corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies. The fact that Real Estate Activities is grouped with other corporate functions under 'All Other' and is subject to restructuring charges suggests it is treated as a shared service or support function rather than a core profit center. In the broader MD&A context on page 42, Real Estate Activities is listed alongside cash management, insurance, and technology, indicating it supports internal operations rather than driving standalone revenue or strategic growth.

The investments are grouped into two business segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company's 'reportable segments' and 'operating segments.' Upstream  operations  consist  primarily  of  ex ploring  for,  developing,  producing  and  transporting  crude  oil  and  natural  gas;  liquefaction,  transportation  and regasification associated with LNG ; transporting crude oil by major international oil ex port pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; carbon capture and storage; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All  Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\n\nThe company's segments are managed by 'segment managers' who report to the 'chief operating decision maker' (CODM), which is comprised of the company's Executive Committee, as referenced in Item 10 Executive Officers.\n\nThe segments represent components of the company that engage in activities from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred. Each segment has discrete financial information available. The CODM regularly reviews the operating results of these segments to assess their performance and make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments. The company's primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile, while other components of the company's operations are reported as 'International' (outside the United States).\n\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices. Revenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, as well as the sale of third-party production of  natural  gas.  Revenues  for  the  downstream  segment  are  derived  from  the  refining  and  marketing  of  petroleum  products  such  as  gasoline,  jet  fuel,  gas  oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives, renewable fuels, and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. 'All Other' activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and  regional  supply-and-demand  balance  for  refined  products  and  petrochemicals,  and  by  changes  in  the  price  of  crude  oil,  other  refinery  and  petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\n\nOther factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company's shipping operations, which are driven by the industry's demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company's control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company's refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nThe company's most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. The company is also one of the largest renewable fuels producers in the United States.\n\nRefer to the 'Results of Operations' section on page 44 for additional discussion of the company's downstream operations.\n\nAll Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.",

      "question": "What explains the Alaska segment's earnings decline in 2023 despite its strategic importance as highlighted by production activities in the Greater Prudhoe Area?",
      "answer": "The Alaska segment's earnings declined in 2023, despite its strategic importance, due to a combination of factors tied to production and financial performance. According to the production data, Alaska's natural gas production was 38 MMcfD in 2023, a slight increase from 34 MMcfD in 2022, with the Greater Prudhoe Area contributing 35 MMcfD in 2023 compared to 32 MMcfD in 2022. However, the segment reported earnings of $1,778 million in 2023, down from $2,352 million in 2022, primarily due to lower realized crude oil prices and higher production and operating expenses. These pressures were attributed to increased well work and transportation costs, as well as higher DD&A expenses driven by downward reserve revisions. While the segment remains strategically important\u2014as evidenced by its role in exploration activities like the Willow project and its inclusion among the six core operating segments\u2014the earnings decline reflects operational and market challenges that offset the benefits of increased production in the Greater Prudhoe Area.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: COP(page_151) \u2192 Natural Gas Production: The company reports that Alaska's natural gas production was 38 MMcfD in 2023, with the Greater Prudhoe Area contributing 35 MMcfD.",
        "Hop 2: Natural Gas Production \u2192 Alaska Segment: The Alaska segment is described as exploring for, producing, transporting, and marketing crude oil, NGLs, and natural gas, with 2023 production contributing 2% of consolidated natural gas production.",
        "Hop 3: Alaska Segment \u2190 COP(page_133): The Alaska segment is one of six core operating segments, underscoring its strategic importance to the company despite reporting lower earnings in 2023."

      "question": "How does ExxonMobil's strategy of divesting natural gas assets align with its reserve reporting methodology, particularly considering the impact of price volatility on proved reserves and production volumes?",
      "answer": "ExxonMobil's strategy of divesting natural gas assets is influenced by its reserve reporting methodology, which ties proved reserves to economic producibility under existing conditions, including average prices over the prior 12 months. For example, in 2021, natural gas production increased slightly (+66 million cubic feet per day) despite divestments, indicating that divestments were offset by other growth factors. However, in 2020, natural gas production fell significantly (-923 million cubic feet per day), with divestments cited as a key factor. This suggests that when prices are low (as they were in 2020), the economic viability of reserves declines, prompting divestments. The reserve reporting methodology, which adjusts reserves based on price changes, supports this dynamic by reducing the volume of economically producible reserves during periods of low prices, thereby justifying asset exits. This alignment reflects a strategic approach to portfolio optimization based on economic thresholds embedded in reserve reporting.",

          "chunk_text": "## Oil and Gas Reserves\n\nThe following information describes changes during the years and balances of proved oil and gas reserves at year-end 2019, 2020 and 2021.\n\nThe definitions used are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Rule 4-10 (a) of Regulation S-X.\n\nProved oil and natural gas reserves are those quantities of oil and natural gas, which, by analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible - from a given date forward, from known reservoirs, and  under  existing  economic  conditions,  operating  methods  and  government  regulations  -  prior  to  the  time  at  which  contracts providing the right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain. In some cases, substantial new investments in additional wells and related facilities will be required to recover these proved reserves.\n\nIn accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) rules, the Corporation's year-end reserves volumes as well as the reserves change categories shown in the following tables are required to be calculated on the basis of average prices during the 12-month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report, determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month  price  for  each  month  within  such  period.  These  reserves  quantities  are  also  used  in  calculating  unit-ofproduction depreciation rates and in calculating the standardized measure of discounted net cash flows.\n\nRevisions can include upward or downward changes in previously estimated volumes of proved reserves for existing fields due to the  evaluation  or  re-evaluation  of  (1)  already  available  geologic,  reservoir  or  production  data,  (2)  new  geologic,  reservoir  or production data or (3) changes in the average of first-of-month oil and natural gas prices and/or costs that are used in the estimation of  reserves.  Revisions  can  also  result  from  significant  changes  in  either  development  strategy  or  production  equipment/facility capacity.\n\nProved  reserves  include  100  percent  of  each  majority-owned  affiliate's  participation  in  proved  reserves  and  ExxonMobil's ownership percentage  of  the  proved  reserves  of  equity  companies,  but  exclude  royalties  and  quantities  due  others.  Natural  gas reserves exclude the gaseous equivalent of liquids expected to be removed from the natural gas on leases, at field facilities and at gas processing plants. These liquids are included in net proved reserves of crude oil and natural gas liquids.\n\nIn the proved reserves tables, consolidated reserves and equity company reserves are reported separately. However, the Corporation does not view equity company reserves any differently than those from consolidated companies.\n\nReserves reported under production sharing and other nonconcessionary agreements are based on the economic interest as defined by the specific fiscal terms in the agreement. The production and reserves reported for these types of arrangements typically vary inversely with oil and natural gas price changes. As oil and natural gas prices increase, the cash flow and value received by the company increase; however, the production volumes and reserves required to achieve this value will typically be lower because of the higher prices. When prices decrease, the opposite effect generally occurs. The percentage of total proved reserves (consolidated subsidiaries plus equity companies) at year-end 2021 that were associated with production sharing contract arrangements was 12 percent  on  an  oil-equivalent  basis  (natural  gas  is  converted  to  an  oil-equivalent  basis  at  six  billion  cubic  feet  per  one  million barrels).\n\nNet proved developed reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Net proved undeveloped reserves are those volumes that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\n\nCrude oil, natural gas liquids, and natural gas production quantities shown are the net volumes withdrawn from ExxonMobil's oil and natural gas reserves. The natural gas quantities differ from the quantities of natural gas delivered for sale by the producing function as reported in the Upstream Operational Results due to volumes consumed or flared and inventory changes.\n\nThe changes between 2021 year-end proved reserves and 2020 year-end proved reserves reflect upward revisions of 2.4 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.5 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, primarily as a result of improved prices. In addition, extensions and discoveries of approximately 1.3 billion oil-equivalent barrels (GOEB) occurred primarily in the United States (0.9 GOEB), Brazil (0.2 GOEB) and Guyana (0.1 GOEB). Worldwide production in 2021 was 1.4 GOEB.\n\nThe downward revisions in 2020, primarily as a result of low prices during 2020, include 3.1 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl, 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake, and 0.5 GOEB in the United States. In addition, the Corporation's near-term reduction in capital  expenditures  resulted  in  a  net  reduction  to  estimates  of  proved  reserves  of  approximately  1.5  GOEB,  mainly  related  to unconventional drilling in the United States.",

These factors consist of net interest changes specified in Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs) which typically  occur  when  cumulative  investment  returns  or  production  volumes  achieve  defined  thresholds,  changes  in  equity  upon achieving pay-out in partner investment carry situations, equity redeterminations as specified in venture agreements, or as a result of the termination or expiry of a concession. Once a net interest change has occurred, it typically will not be reversed by subsequent events, such as lower crude oil prices.\n\nEntitlements - Price, Spend and Other are changes to ExxonMobil's share of production volumes resulting from temporary changes to non-operational volume-determining factors. These factors include changes in oil and gas prices or spending levels from one period to another. According to the terms of contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, price or spending variability can increase or decrease royalty burdens and/or volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. For example, at higher prices, fewer barrels are required for ExxonMobil to recover its costs. These effects generally vary from period to period with field spending patterns or market prices for oil and natural gas. Such factors can also include other temporary changes in net interest as dictated by specific provisions in production agreements.\n\nGovernment Mandates are  changes  to  ExxonMobil's  sustainable  production  levels  due  to  temporary  non-operational  production limits imposed by governments, generally upon a sector, type or method of production.\n\nDivestments are reductions in ExxonMobil's production arising from commercial arrangements to fully or partially reduce equity in a field or asset in exchange for financial or other economic consideration.\n\nDemand, Growth and Other factors comprise all other operational and non-operational factors not covered by the above definitions that may affect volumes attributable to ExxonMobil. Such factors include, but are not limited to, production enhancements from project  and  work  program  activities,  acquisitions  including  additions  from  asset  exchanges,  downtime,  market  demand,  natural field decline, and any fiscal or commercial terms that do not affect entitlements.",

      "answer": "The 85 MBOED production increase in the Lower 48 segment (page_152) was partly driven by the Marathon Oil acquisition, which added significant assets across multiple basins (page_46). This acquisition contributed to the provisional fair value of $10.8 billion assigned to unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment (page_76). The valuation of these unproved properties involves complex estimation techniques, including discounted cash flow models based on market participant assumptions. The significant estimation required for reserves and the sensitivity of key assumptions\u2014such as future commodity prices, production rates, and discount rates\u2014create valuation complexities. The audit process required extensive testing and sensitivity analyses due to the high degree of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of these newly acquired unproved properties, which remain unfinalized.

During 2024, the Lower 48 contributed 63 percent of our consolidated liquids production and 74 percent of our consolidated natural gas production.\n\n## Net Income (Loss)\n\nLower 48 reported earnings of $5,175 million in 2024, compared with earnings of $6,461 million in 2023.\n\nDecreases to earnings included lower revenues resulting from lower overall commodity prices of $904 million and the timing of sales as compared with 2023, partly offset by higher volumes of $1,003 million, which includes volumes added from our acquisition of Marathon Oil. Additional decreases to earnings i ncluded higher DD&amp;A of $562 million, driven by higher production of $250 million, higher rates of $181 million and impacts from our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $139 million; higher production and operating expenses of $431 million, driven by higher transportation related costs of $132 million, expenses associated with our acquisition of Marathon Oil of $110 million and higher lease operating expenses of $100 million; as well as the absence of gains associated with the divestiture of an equity investment of $100 million. See Note 3.\n\n## Production\n\nTotal average production increased 85 MBOED in 2024 compared with 2023, primarily due to new wells online from our development programs in Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Midland Basin and Bakken and the impact from assets acquired from Marathon Oil. See Note 3.\n\nThe production increase was partly offset by normal field decline and higher unplanned downtime across all basins.\n\n## Acquisition of Marathon Oil\n\nOn November 22, 2024, we completed our acquisition of Marathon Oil. The transaction added additional assets to our Lower 48 segment across several basins. Production from Lower 48 assets acquired from Marathon Oil averaged approximately 334 MBOED in the month of December 2024. See Note 3.\n\n## Planned Dispositions\n\nWe recently entered into agreements to sell noncore assets within our Lower 48 segment that are expected to close in the first half of 2025 for approximately $600 million, subject to customary closing adjustments.

As described in Note 3, the transaction was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. As also described in Note 3, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties. Oil and gas properties were valued by specialists using a discounted cash flow approach based on market participant assumptions. Significant inputs to the valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties include estimates of future commodity prices and production, future operating costs and discount rates using a market-based weighted average cost of capital.\n\nAuditing the Company's accounting for its provisional valuation of proved and unproved oil and gas properties within the Lower 48 segment is complex and judgmental due to the significant estimation required by management of reserves associated with the acquired assets and the sensitivity of significant assumptions used in determining the fair value. In evaluating the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions used, the audit testing procedures performed required a high degree of auditor j udgment and additional effort, including involving internal valuation specialists.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of the Company's internal controls over its process to estimate the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, including management's review of the significant assumptions used as inputs to the fair value calculations and recording of the provisional valuation.\n\nTo test the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties, our audit procedures included, among others, evaluating the significant assumptions used and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data supporting the significant assumptions. For example, we compared certain significant assumptions to current industry and thirdparty data and historical results for reasonableness. We also performed sensitivity analyses of significant assumptions, to evaluate the extent of their impact to the provisional fair value calculation. In addition, we involved internal valuation specialists to assist with certain significant assumptions included in the provisional fair value estimate. Furthermore, we evaluated the professional qualifications and objectivity of the Company's internal reservoir engineers primarily responsible for overseeing the oil and gas reserves estimates and the valuation specialists used by the Company to prepare the provisional fair value of the acquired proved and unproved oil and gas properties. In addition, in assessing whether we can use the work of the internal reservoir engineers, we evaluated the completeness and accuracy of the significant data and inputs used by the internal reservoir engineers in estimating oil and gas reserves by agreeing them to source documentation, as applicable, and we identified and evaluated corroborative and contrary evidence. As noted above, the Company has not finalized its allocation of fair value to unproved properties\n\n/s/ Ernst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1949.\n\nHouston, Texas February 18, 2025\n\nConocoPhillips   2024 10-K\n\n74",

      "answer": "The Lower 48 segment, despite undergoing asset write-downs in 2021 due to declining fair values, remained a dominant contributor to COP's production in 2023, accounting for 64% of consolidated liquids production. This resilience was driven by new wells coming online in key basins like the Delaware and Midland Basins, which offset normal field declines. Meanwhile, Canadian operations contributed only 7% of consolidated liquids production in 2023, indicating a much smaller role compared to the Lower 48. The continued production growth in the Lower 48, despite earlier impairments, suggests that COP's investment in new development programs helped sustain output levels, contrasting with the relatively minor contribution from Canada.",

Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\n\nIn fourth quarter 2024, the company announced plans to achieve $2-3 billion in structural cost reductions by the end of 2026. These cost savings will largely come from optimizing the portfolio, leveraging technology to enhance productivity, and changing how and where work is performed, including expanded use of global capability centers. In relation to these efforts, the company recognized a restructuring charge of $715 million after tax in fourth quarter 2024, with associated cash outflows anticipated over the next two years. The company continues to evaluate incremental cost reduction opportunities and could incur additional restructuring and reorganization charges in future periods. This will have an impact on the company's pension and Other Post-Employment Benefit (OPEB) plans; however, the impact is not yet estimable and any impacts will be recognized in future periods.\n\nEarnings trends for the company's major business areas are described as follows:\n\nUpstream Earnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. These prices are subject to external factors over  which  the  company  has  no  control,  including  product  demand  connected  with  global  economic  conditions,  industry  production  and  inventory  levels, technology  advancements,  production  quotas  or  other  actions  imposed  by  OPEC+  countries,  actions  of  regulators,  weather-related  damage  and  disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company's control, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company's production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\n\nThe longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company's ability to efficiently find, acquire and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\n\nIn April 2024, Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO) achieved start-up of the Wellhead Pressure Management Project (WPMP) and at year-end 2024, all four pressure boost facility compressors are online and all metering stations have been converted to low pressure. In January 2025, TCO started oil production at its Future G rowth Project, which is ex pected to contribute to higher free cash flow.\n\nChevron has interests in V enezuelan assets operated by independent affiliates. Chevron has been conducting limited activities in V enezuela consistent with the authorization provided pursuant to licenses issued by the United States government. In fourth quarter 2022, Chevron received G eneral License 41 from the United States government, enabling the company to resume activity in V enezuela subject to certain limitations, and the company continues such activities under this G eneral License. The financial results for Chevron's business in V enezuela are being recorded as non-equity investments since 2020, where income is only recognized when cash is received and production and reserves are not included in the company's results. Crude oil liftings in V enezuela started in first quarter 2023, which have positively impacted the company's results. The company's independent affiliates have continued to maintain safe and reliable operations; however, future impact on results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.\n\nChevron maintains an equity interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) which provides a primary export route for Tengiz field production in Kazakhstan. An adverse  event  or  incident  affecting  CPC  operations,  which  CPC  has  ex perienced  from  time  to  time,  could  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  Tengiz  field  and  the company's results of operations and financial position. The financial impacts of such risks, including presently imposed sanctions and the February 2025 drone attack on the CPC pumping station, remain uncertain.\n\nOther governments (including Russia) have imposed and may impose additional sanctions and other trade laws, restrictions and regulations that could lead to disruption in our ability to produce, transport and/or ex port crude in the region around Russia.\n\nChevron holds a 39.7 percent interest in the Leviathan field and a 25 percent interest in the Tamar field in Israel. Despite the ongoing conflict between Israel and various regional adversaries, the company continues to maintain safe and reliable operations while meeting its contractual commitments. The company continues to monitor the ongoing conflict in the region and any future impacts on the company's results of operations and financial condition remain uncertain.",
