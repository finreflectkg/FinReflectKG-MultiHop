      "question": "How does Target's historical volatility in vendor income collections, as well as its accounting treatment of vendor income as a cost offset, influence its forward-looking assumptions about the reliability of vendor income as a predictable component of future profitability?",
      "answer": "Target's vendor income, which is primarily recorded as a reduction of cost of sales, has shown relative stability in receivables with $513 million and $526 million as of February 3, 2024, and January 28, 2023, respectively. The company notes that historical adjustments to the vendor income receivable have not been material and that most receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, suggesting a high degree of predictability. However, the company also notes in its forward-looking statements that future profitability assumptions depend on various factors, including vendor income expectations. This implies that while vendor income has historically been stable, Target still treats it as a contingent component in its forward-looking financial planning, acknowledging that changes in vendor programs or purchasing volumes could impact future results.",

        "Hop 1: TGT (page_34) \u2192 Vendor Income: Discloses that vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales and that receivables are largely collected within the next fiscal quarter, with historically immaterial adjustments.",
        "Hop 2: TGT (page_49) \u2192 Vendor Income: Further details that vendor income includes volume rebates, markdown allowances, and advertising allowances, and is a substantial offset to cost of sales, reinforcing its materiality to gross margin.",
        "Hop 3: TGT (page_36) \u2192 Vendor Income: Notes that forward-looking statements include expectations regarding vendor income, indicating that while assumptions are based on historical trends, they remain subject to change based on external factors like vendor programs and purchasing behavior."

      "answer": "Target opened 21 new stores in 2023, emphasizing new design elements and local community integration (page_23). The company plans to open about 20 new stores in 2024 as part of a $3.0\u2013$4.0 billion capital expenditure strategy that includes new stores, remodels, and supply chain investments (page_32). However, Target's risk disclosures note that macroeconomic conditions could lead to delays or cancellations of new store projects, which could result in inefficient capital deployment and negatively impact financial performance (page_11). This indicates that while new store expansion remains a key strategic focus, external economic pressures pose a material risk to the execution and return on these investments.",

      "question": "How does Target's decline in total sales during 2023 align with their strategic investments in digital fulfillment and store remodeling, and what does this reveal about the effectiveness of their omnichannel approach?",
      "answer": "Target reported a 1.7% decline in total sales for 2023, with comparable sales decreasing by 3.7%, driven by lower traffic and average transaction amounts. Despite this, the company made significant strategic investments in digital fulfillment, including expanding same-day delivery options and completing 65 full store remodels to enhance the omnichannel experience. Additionally, stores fulfilled over 96% of total sales, highlighting their dual role as retail and fulfillment hubs. This suggests that while Target is investing to strengthen its omnichannel capabilities, these efforts have not yet translated into sales growth, potentially indicating a lag in consumer adoption or execution challenges.",

      "answer": "Target's EBIT improved significantly in 2023 compared to 2022, rising from $3,896 million to $5,799 million, reflecting a 48.8% increase. This improvement is also evident in the income statement, where operating income rose from $3,848 million in 2022 to $5,707 million in 2023. Additionally, the after-tax return on invested capital increased from 12.6% in 2022 to 16.1% in 2023, indicating better capital efficiency. Together, these metrics suggest that Target not only improved its core operating profitability but also enhanced its ability to generate returns from invested capital, reflecting stronger operational efficiency and better asset utilization in 2023.",

However, the Sam's Club segment saw a 68 basis point decrease in gross profit rate due to higher fuel sales (which carry lower margins), cost inflation, and supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix. Meanwhile, the Walmart U.S. segment's gross profit rate was positively impacted by strategic sourcing and fewer markdowns in fiscal 2021, though this was offset by supply chain costs and merchandise mix changes in fiscal 2022. Internationally, while the gross profit rate benefited from a $4.5 billion positive impact of currency exchange rates, the divestiture of operations in the U.K. and Japan caused a $32.6 billion net sales decrease, influencing the consolidated gross profit rate trajectory.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. V olatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. (1)\n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.\n\nMembership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

Gross profit rate for fiscal 2021 benefited from strategic sourcing initiatives and fewer markdowns, but was offset by a change in merchandise mix, the carryover effect of prior price investment and the temporary closure of our Auto Care and Vision Centers in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased 31 basis points for fiscal 2022 when compared to the previous fiscal year. Despite the strong sales growth described above, fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales increased primarily due to investments in wages, partially offset by lower incremental COVID-19 related costs of $1.9 billion. For fiscal 2021, operating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 15 basis points primarily due to strong sales, which were partially offset by $3.2 billion of incremental costs related to the COVID-19 pandemic including special bonuses, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, costs associated with outfitting our stores and associates with masks, gloves and sanitizer, and expanded cleaning practices.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $2.5 billion and increased $1.7 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Walmart International Segment\n\n",

These increases in revenues were primarily due to increases in net sales, which increased $12.5 billion or 2.3% and $35.3 billion or 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments which benefited from strong U.S. consumer spending and some inflation, along with positive comparable sales in most of our remaining international markets. The increase was partially offset by a $32.6 billion net sales decrease primarily related to the divestiture of our operations in the U.K. and Japan, which closed in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. Net sales also benefited from a $4.5 billion positive impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates during fiscal 2022. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to strong positive comparable sales for the Walmart U.S. and Sam's Club segments as well as positive comparable sales in the majority of our international markets resulting from increased demand stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic. Overall net sales growth was strong despite certain operating limitations in several international markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2021 due to government regulations and precautionary measures taken as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. The net sales increase was partially offset by a negative impact from fluctuations in currency exchange rates of $5.0 billion.\n\nOur gross profit rate increased 14 and 20 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.

      "answer": "Walmart's U.S. eCommerce sales grew significantly from $24.1 billion in fiscal 2020 to $47.8 billion in fiscal 2022, reflecting strong expansion in its digital commerce operations. This growth is consistent with the company's revenue recognition policy, which records eCommerce sales upon delivery to the customer, including shipping revenue, indicating a clear alignment between operational performance and financial reporting.

          "chunk_text": "## Net Investment Hedges\n\nPrior to the divestiture of the Company's operations in the United Kingdom and Japan as discussed in Note 12, the Company was a party to receive fixed-rate, pay fixed-rate cross currency interest rate swaps used to hedge the currency exposure associated with net investments of these foreign operations. Changes in fair value attributable to the hedged risk were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss. The Company also previously designated certain foreign currency denominated long-term debt as a hedge of currency exposure associated with the net investment of these divested operations and recorded foreign currency gain or loss associated with designated long-term debt in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Upon closing of the sale of the Company's operations in the U.K. and Japan during the first quarter of fiscal 2022, these amounts were released from accumulated other comprehensive loss as discussed in Note 4. As of January 31, 2021, the Company had $3.3 billion of outstanding long-term debt designated as net investment hedges.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the balance sheet method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases (\"temporary differences\"). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rate is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\n\nDeferred tax assets are evaluated for future realization and reduced by a valuation allowance to the extent that a portion is not more likely than not to be realized. Many factors are considered when assessing whether it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized, including recent cumulative earnings, expectations of future taxable income, carryforward periods, and other relevant quantitative and qualitative factors. The recoverability of the deferred tax assets is evaluated by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income from all sources, including reversal of taxable temporary differences, forecasted operating earnings and available tax planning strategies. These sources of income rely on estimates.\n\nIn determining the provision for income taxes, an annual effective income tax rate is used based on annual income, permanent differences between book and tax income, and statutory income tax rates. Discrete events such as audit settlements or changes in tax laws are recognized in the period in which they occur.\n\nThe Company records a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The Company records interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating, selling, general and administrative expenses, respectively, in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Refer to Note 9 for additional income tax disclosures.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\n## Net Sales\n\nThe Company recognizes sales revenue, net of sales taxes and estimated sales returns, at the time it sells merchandise or services to the customer. eCommerce sales include shipping revenue and are recorded upon delivery to the customer. Estimated sales returns are calculated based on expected returns.\n\n## Membership Fee Revenue\n\nThe Company recognizes membership fee revenue both in the U.S. and internationally over the term of the membership, which is typically 12 months. Membership fee revenue was $2.2 billion for fiscal 2022, $1.7 billion for fiscal 2021 and $1.5 billion for fiscal 2020, respectively. Membership fee revenue is included in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income. Deferred membership fee revenue is included in accrued liabilities in the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n\n## Gift Cards\n\nCustomer purchases of gift cards are not recognized as sales until the card is redeemed and the customer purchases merchandise using the gift card. Gift cards in the U.S. and some countries do not carry an expiration date; therefore, customers and members can redeem their gift cards for merchandise and services indefinitely. Gift cards in some countries where the Company does business have expiration dates. While gift cards are generally redeemed within 12 months, a certain number of gift cards, both with and without expiration dates, will not be fully redeemed. Management estimates unredeemed balances and recognizes revenue for these amounts in membership and other income in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income over the expected redemption period.\n\n## Financial and Other Services\n\nThe Company recognizes revenue from service transactions at the time the service is performed. Generally, revenue from services is classified as a component of net sales in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Income.",

          "chunk_text": "\nWe believe the \"Excluding Fuel\" information is useful to investors because it permits investors to understand the effect of the Sam's Club segment's fuel sales on its results of operations, which are impacted by the volatility of fuel prices. V olatility in fuel prices may continue to impact the operating results of the Sam's Club segment in the future. Management uses such information to better measure underlying operating results in the segment. (1)\n\nNet sales for the Sam's Club segment increased $9.6 billion or 15.1% and $5.1 billion or 8.7% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales growth, including fuel, of 15.0%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket due to increased consumer spending, which was aided by government stimulus, and also includes some higher inflation impacts in certain merchandise categories compared to recent years. The growth in comparable sales was partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 1.3% to comparable sales. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to comparable sales, including fuel, of 8.7%. Comparable sales benefited from growth in transactions and average ticket resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by our decision to remove tobacco from certain club locations and by lower fuel sales. Sam's Club eCommerce sales positively contributed approximately 2.2% to comparable sales.\n\nGross profit rate decreased 68 basis points and increased 65 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the decrease in gross profit rate was primarily due to increased fuel sales which have lower margins, cost inflation, and higher supply chain costs, partially offset by favorable sales mix, including reduced tobacco sales. For fiscal 2021, gross profit rate increased due to favorable sales mix, including lower fuel and tobacco sales, and improvement in inventory losses which was partially offset by price investment and higher eCommerce fulfillment costs.\n\nMembership and other income increased 13.1% and 6.8% for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. For fiscal 2022, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members and increased Plus Member penetration. For fiscal 2021, the increase was primarily due to growth in total members, which benefited from higher overall renewal rates and higher Plus Member penetration.\n\nOperating expenses as a percentage of segment net sales decreased 82 basis points and increased 42 basis points for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year. Fiscal 2022 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased primarily due to higher sales as well as a benefit from $0.2 billion of lower incremental COVID-19 related costs, partially offset by reduced tobacco sales. Despite the increased sales growth described above, fiscal 2021 operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased primarily due to $0.3 billion of incremental costs related to the pandemic, which included additional costs such as special bonuses, expanded cleaning practices and security, expanded sick and emergency leave pay, and outfitting our associates with masks and gloves. Additionally, the increase in operating expense as a percentage of segment net sales was affected by reduced tobacco and fuel sales.\n\nAs a result of the factors discussed above, segment operating income increased $0.4 billion and $0.3 billion for fiscal 2022 and 2021, respectively, when compared to the previous fiscal year.\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resources\n\n## Liquidity\n\nThe strength and stability of our operations have historically supplied us with a significant source of liquidity. Our cash flows provided by operating activities, supplemented with our long-term debt and short-term borrowings, have been sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to invest in activities that support the long-term growth of our operations. Generally, some or all of the remaining available cash flow has been used to fund dividends on our common stock and share repurchases. We believe our sources of liquidity will continue to be sufficient to fund operations, finance our global investment activities, pay dividends and fund our share repurchases for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future.",

      "question": "How does the trend in Operating Income as a Percentage of Net Sales across Walmart's U.S., International, and Sam's Club segments reflect the company's overall profitability performance and operational efficiency in fiscal 2022 compared to prior years?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2022, Walmart's U.S. segment reported Operating Income as a Percentage of Net Sales of 5.5%, up from 5.2% in 2021 and 5.1% in 2020. The International segment saw a decline in this metric from 3.0% in 2021 to 2.8% in 2020, before rebounding to 3.7% in 2022. Meanwhile, Sam's Club segment improved slightly from 3.0% in 2021 to 3.1% in 2022, after remaining flat at 2.8% in 2020 for both including and excluding fuel. Collectively, these trends indicate that while the U.S. business drove stronger profitability, the International segment experienced volatility, and Sam's Club showed modest improvement, contributing to a mixed but overall positive trajectory in operational efficiency.",

      "answer": "The percentage change in net sales reveals distinct growth patterns across Walmart's business segments. In fiscal 2022, U.S. operations (excluding fuel) grew by 9.6%, up from 12.1% in fiscal 2021, indicating a slowdown in domestic expansion. Meanwhile, International operations reported a more modest 6.3% growth in 2022, down from 8.5% in 2021, suggesting emerging market pressures. In contrast, the consolidated financials show a 2.3% increase in net sales in 2022, a significant deceleration from 6.8% in 2021, reflecting the dilutive impact of underperforming segments and the challenges of scaling a mature global enterprise. Together, these figures highlight divergent regional performance and the difficulty in sustaining high growth rates across a diversified retail footprint.",

      "answer": "The $1.3 billion non-cash impairment charge for the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset, which arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies, and restructuring in Enterprise Markets, directly contributed to the operating margin remaining flat at 22.1% despite a 350 basis-point increase in gross margin. This impairment reflects the sensitivity of the asset's fair value to changes in assumptions, as demonstrated by the sensitivity analysis: a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate or a 25 basis-point decrease in growth rates reduces the asset's estimated fair value by approximately 5%, while a 50 basis-point decrease in royalty rates reduces it by about 4%. These sensitivities highlight how relatively small shifts in financial assumptions can materially impact the valuation and, consequently, the company's financial results.",

          "chunk_text": "indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands. Other acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain brands, customer relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to brands that have an indefinite life and those that have a determinable life is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the brands are sold. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated lives. An impairment assessment for determinable-lived intangibles is only required when an event or change in circumstances indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable.\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are tested at least annually for impairment. We use the income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. When appropriate, the market approach, which leverages comparable company revenue and earnings multiples, is weighted with the income approach to estimate fair value. If the resulting fair value is less than the asset's carrying value, that difference represents an impairment. Our annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets occurs during the three months ended December 31. Other than our G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset, our goodwill reporting units and our indefinite-lived intangible assets have fair values that significantly ex ceed their underlying carrying values.\n\nDuring the fiscal year ended June 30, 2024, we determined the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was less than its carrying value. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $1.3 billion ($1.0 billion after tax ) to reduce the carrying amount to be equivalent to the estimated fair value. As of June 30, 2024, the carrying value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset was $12.8 billion. The impairment charge arose due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of a new restructuring program focused primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina and Nigeria.\n\nWhile we have concluded that no triggering event has occurred during the quarter ended June 30, 2024, the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is susceptible to future impairment risk. Adverse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic environment including foreign currency devaluation, increasing global inflation, or market contraction from an economic recession, could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset and trigger a future impairment charge.\n\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset are the net sales growth rates (including residual growth rates), discount rate and royalty rates.\n\nNet sales growth rates could be negatively impacted by reductions or changes in demand for our G illette products, which may be caused by, among other things: changes in the use and frequency of grooming products, shifts in demand away from one or more of our higher priced products to lower priced products or potential supply chain constraints. In addition, relative global and country/regional macroeconomic factors could result in additional and prolonged devaluation of other countries' currencies relative to the U.S. dollar. The residual growth rates represent the expected rate at which the G illette brand is expected to grow beyond the shorter-term business planning period. The residual growth rates utilized in our fair value estimates are consistent with the brand operating plans and approximates expected long-term category market growth rates. The residual growth rates depend on overall market growth rates, the competitive environment, inflation, relative currency  exchange  rates  and  business  activities  that  impact  market  share. As  a  result,  the  residual  growth  rates  could  be  adversely  impacted  by  a  sustained deceleration in category growth, grooming habit changes, devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar or an increased competitive environment.\n\nThe discount rate, which is consistent with a weighted average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by a market participant, is based upon industry required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by adverse changes in the macroeconomic environment, volatility in the equity and debt markets or other country specific factors, such as further devaluation of currencies against the U.S. dollar. Spot rates as of the fair value measurement date are utilized in our fair value estimates for cash flows outside the U.S.\n\nThe royalty rate used to determine the estimated fair value for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset is driven by historical and estimated future profitability of the underlying Gillette business. The royalty rate may be impacted by significant adverse changes in long-term operating margins.\n\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis for the G illette indefinite-lived intangible asset as part of our annual impairment testing during the three months ended December 31, 2023, utilizing reasonably possible changes in the assumptions for the discount rate, the short-term and residual growth rates and the royalty rates to demonstrate the potential impacts to the estimated fair values. The table below provides, in isolation, the estimated fair value impacts related to a 25 basis-point increase in the discount rate, a 25 basis-point decrease in our shorter-term and residual growth rates, or a 50 basis-point decrease in our royalty rates, which may result in an additional impairment of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset.",

Before tax costs incurred under ongoing programs have generally ranged from $250 to $500 annually.\n\nIn  December 2023, the Company announced a limited market portfolio restructuring of its business operations, primarily in certain Enterprise Markets, including Argentina  and  Nigeria,  to  address  challenging  macroeconomic  and  fiscal  conditions.  In  connection  with  this  announcement,  the  Company  expects  to  record incremental restructuring charges of $1.0 to $1.5 billion after tax , consisting primarily of foreign currency translation losses to be recognized as non-cash charges upon the substantial liquidation of operations in the affected markets.\n\nThe Company incurred total restructuring charges of $659 and $329 for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2024 and 2023. Of the charges incurred for fiscal year 2024, $248 were recorded in Costs of products sold, $155 in SG &amp;A and $255 in Other non-operating income, net.

      "answer": "The 105% adjusted free cash flow productivity in 2024, as reported in the financial highlights, reflects Procter & Gamble's strong cash generation relative to net earnings after excluding the $1.3 billion non-cash Gillette intangible asset impairment and foreign currency translation losses from operations in markets like Nigeria. This metric, which is defined and contextualized in the explanatory section on adjusted free cash flow productivity, shows an improvement from 95% in 2023, aligning with the $19.8 billion in operating cash flow and $16.9 billion in adjusted free cash flow reported in the cash flow statement. The increase in productivity highlights P&G's ability to convert earnings into cash despite a higher effective tax rate and $589 million in negative foreign exchange impacts on net earnings, demonstrating resilience in cash flow generation amid broader financial pressures.",

However, its organic sales growth was described as 'low single digits,' which is modest compared to larger growth rates seen in other segments like Grooming, which reported 'high single-digit' organic growth despite representing only 8% of net sales.

References to market share and consumption in the MD&amp;A are based on a combination of vendor-purchased traditional brick-and-mortar and online data in key markets as well as internal estimates. All market share references represent the percentage of sales of our products in dollar terms on a constant currency basis relative to all product sales in the category. The Company measures quarter and fiscal year-to-date market shares through the most recent period for which market share data is available, which typically reflects a lag time of one or two months as compared to the end of  the  reporting  period.  Management also uses unit volume growth to evaluate drivers of changes in net sales.  Organic volume growth reflects year-over-year changes in unit volume excluding the impacts of acquisitions and divestitures and certain one-time items, if applicable, and is used to explain changes in organic sales. In our presentation of data in tables or other charts, certain columns and rows may not add due to rounding.\n\n## OVERVIEW\n\nP&amp;G is a global leader in the fast-moving consumer goods industry, focused on providing branded consumer packaged goods of superior quality and value to our consumers around the world.  Our products are sold in about 180 countries and territories primarily through mass merchandisers, e-commerce (including social commerce) channels, grocery stores, membership club stores, drug stores, department stores, distributors, wholesalers, specialty beauty stores (including airport duty-free stores), high-frequency stores, pharmacies, electronics stores and professional channels. We also sell direct to individual consumers. We have on-theground operations in about 70 countries.\n\nOur market environment is highly competitive with global, regional and local competitors.  In many of the markets and industry segments in which we sell our products, we compete against other branded products as well as retailers' private-label brands. Additionally, many of the product segments in which we compete are differentiated by price tiers (referred to as super-premium, premium, mid-tier and value-tier products). We believe we are well positioned in the industry segments and markets in which we operate, often holding a leadership or significant market share position.\n\n## Organizational Structure\n\nOur organizational structure is comprised of Sector Business Units (SBUs), Enterprise Markets (EMs), Corporate Functions (CF) and Global Business Services (GBS).\n\n## Sector Business Units\n\nThe Company's product categories are organized into five SBUs and five reportable segments (under U.S. GAAP): Beauty; G rooming; Health Care; Fabric &amp; Home Care; and Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care. The SBUs are responsible for global brand strategy, product upgrades and innovation, marketing plans and supply chain. They have direct profit responsibility for markets (referred to as Focus Markets) representing the large majority of the Company's sales and earnings and are also responsible for innovation plans, supply plans and operating frameworks to drive growth and value creation in the remaining markets (referred to as Enterprise Markets). Throughout the MD&amp;A, we reference business results by region, which are comprised of North America, Europe, Greater China, Latin America, Asia Pacific and India, Middle East and Africa (IMEA).",

      "question": "How does the 2% increase in Net Earnings Attributable to Procter & Gamble align with the impact of the higher effective tax rate and foreign exchange headwinds, and how is this reflected in both the consolidated statements and the summarized financial data?",
      "answer": "The 2% increase in Net Earnings Attributable to Procter & Gamble, which rose to $14.9 billion, reflects the tension between higher operating income and a higher effective tax rate (20.2% in 2024 vs. 19.7% in 2023), which partially offset earnings growth. Additionally, foreign exchange impacts reduced net earnings by approximately $589 million due to a weakening of certain currencies against the U.S. dollar. This aligns with the consolidated statements of comprehensive income, where net earnings attributable to PG are the basis for per-share calculations, and the summarized financial data confirms the $14.879 billion figure for 2024, showing consistency across disclosures.",

Despite its size and growth contribution, the segment is subject to evolving segment reporting standards, such as ASU No. 2023-07, which may impact how its performance is disclosed in the future. This suggests that while Fabric & Home Care is strategically central to P&G\u2019s current growth, the company may also be evaluating how to enhance transparency and investment focus in this area under new disclosure requirements.",

However, financial data from 2022 shows that Fresh Foods contributed to a 27 basis point decline in gross margin percentage within core merchandise categories, reflecting margin pressures.

          "chunk_text": "\nTotal gross margin percentage decreased 65 basis points compared to 2021. Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. This was primarily due to a 33 basispoint  decrease  in  core  merchandise  categories,  predominantly  driven  by  decreases  in  fresh  foods  and  foods  and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted  by  one  basis  point  due  to  increased  2%  rewards.  Warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses  positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the  negative  impact  of  a  one-time  charge  related  to  granting  our  employees  one  additional  day  of  paid  time  off. Changes in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  negatively  impacted  gross  margin  by  approximately  $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International Operations.\n\nThe gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 27 basis points. The decrease was across all categories, most significantly in fresh foods. This measure eliminates the impact of changes in sales penetration and gross margins from our warehouse ancillary and other businesses.\n\nGross margin on a segment basis, when expressed as a percentage of the segment's own sales and excluding the impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales (segment gross margin percentage), decreased across all segments. All segments were negatively impacted due to decreases in core merchandise categories, partially offset by increases in warehouse ancillary and other businesses. Gross margin in our U.S. segment was also negatively impacted by the LIFO  charge.  Our  Other  International  segment  was  negatively  impacted  by  increased  2%  rewards.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nOur average warehouse space is approximately 146,000 square feet, with newer units being slightly larger. Floor plans are designed for economy and efficiency in the use of selling space, the handling of merchandise, and the control of inventory. Because shoppers are attracted principally by the quality of merchandise and low prices, our warehouses are not elaborate. By strictly controlling the entrances and exits and using a membership format, we believe our inventory losses (shrinkage) are well below those of typical retail operations.\n\nOur  warehouses  on  average  operate  on  a  seven-day,  70-hour  week.  Gasoline  operations  generally  have  extended hours. Because the hours of operation are shorter than many other retailers, and due to other efficiencies inherent in a warehouse-type operation, labor costs are lower relative to the volume of sales. Merchandise is generally stored on racks above the sales floor and displayed on pallets containing large quantities, reducing labor required. In general, with variations by country, our warehouses accept certain credit cards, including Costco co-branded cards, debit cards, cash and checks, Executive member 2% reward certificates, co-brand cardholder rebates, and our proprietary storedvalue card (shop card).\n\nOur  strategy  is  to  provide  our  members  with  a  broad  range  of  high-quality  merchandise  at  prices  we  believe  are consistently lower than elsewhere. We seek to limit most items to fast-selling models, sizes, and colors. We carry less than 4,000 active stock keeping units (SKUs) per warehouse in our core warehouse business, significantly less than other broadline retailers. We average anywhere from 10,000 to 11,000 SKUs online, some of which are also available in our warehouses. Many consumable products are offered for sale in case, carton, or multiple-pack quantities only.\n\nIn keeping with our policy of member satisfaction, we generally accept returns of merchandise. On certain electronic items, we typically have a 90-day return policy and provide, free of charge, technical support services, as well as an extended warranty. Additional third-party warranty coverage is sold on certain electronic items.\n\nWe offer merchandise and services in the following categories:\n\n## Core Merchandise Categories (or core business):\n\n- Foods and Sundries (including sundries, dry grocery, candy, cooler, freezer, deli, liquor, and tobacco)\n- Non-Foods (including  major  appliances,  electronics,  health  and  beauty  aids,  hardware,  garden  and  patio, sporting  goods,  tires,  toys  and  seasonal,  office  supplies,  automotive  care,  postage,  tickets,  apparel,  small appliances, furniture, domestics, housewares, special order kiosk, and jewelry)\n- Fresh Foods (including meat, produce, service deli, and bakery)\n\nWarehouse Ancillary (includes gasoline, pharmacy, optical, food court, hearing aids, and tire installation) and Other Businesses (includes e-commerce, business centers, travel, and other)\n\nWarehouse ancillary businesses operate primarily within or next to our warehouses, encouraging members to shop more frequently. The number of warehouses with gas stations varies significantly by country, and we have no gasoline business in Korea or China. We operated 668 gas stations at the end of 2022. Net sales for our gasoline business increased to approximately 14% of total net sales in 2022.\n\nOur  other  businesses  sell  products  and  services  that  complement  our  warehouse  operations  (core  and  warehouse ancillary businesses). Our e-commerce operations give members convenience and a broader selection of goods and services.  Net  sales  for  e-commerce  represented  approximately  7%  of  total  net  sales  in  2022.  This  figure  does  not include  other  services  we  offer  online  in  certain  countries  such  as  business  delivery,  travel,  same-day  grocery,  and various other services. Our business centers carry items tailored specifically for food services, convenience stores and offices, and offer walk-in shopping and deliveries. Business centers are included in our total warehouse count. Costco Travel offers vacation packages, hotels, cruises, and other travel products exclusively for Costco members (offered in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.).",

      "question": "How does Costco's exposure to merchandise inventory risk, as outlined in the risk factors, align with the tax treatment of inventories and their impact on cash flows from operations in fiscal 2022?",
      "answer": "Costco's merchandise inventories are highlighted in three distinct but interconnected ways across the filing. In the risk factors (page 14), inventories are framed as a vulnerability due to supplier risks, inflation, and geopolitical events that could disrupt supply or increase costs. Specifically, the document notes that inflationary pressures, especially in 2022, have made it difficult to pass on cost increases without negatively affecting consumer demand. This risk exposure is further contextualized by the deferred tax liability associated with merchandise inventories, which increased from $216 million in 2021 to $231 million in 2022 (page 58), indicating a growing tax impact tied to inventory valuation methods. Meanwhile, in the cash flow statement (page 40), merchandise inventories are shown to have a significant negative cash impact of $4,003 million in fiscal 2022, reflecting the increased investment in inventory to meet member demand and mitigate supply chain disruptions. Together, these perspectives reveal a complex interplay: rising inventory levels are both a strategic necessity and a financial risk, with tax implications and operational cash flow constraints compounding the challenge of managing inventories effectively in a volatile economic environment.",

Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United States, have affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. The impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nPrices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail  operations,  are  historically  volatile  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and international  supply  and  demand,  inflationary  pressures,  labor  costs,  competition,  market  speculation,  government regulations, taxes and periodic delays in delivery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrative expenses, and otherwise adversely affect our operations  and  financial  results.  General  economic  conditions  can  also  be  affected  by  events  like  the  outbreak  of hostilities, including but not limited to the Ukraine conflict, or acts of terrorism.\n\nInflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. If inflation on merchandise increases beyond our ability to control we may not be able to adjust prices  to  sufficiently  offset  the  effect  of  the  various  cost  increases  without  negatively  impacting  consumer  demand. Certain merchandise categories were impacted by inflation higher than what we have experienced in recent years due to, among other things, the continuing impacts of the pandemic and uncertain economic environment.\n\nSuppliers  may  be  unable  to  timely  supply  us  with  quality  merchandise  at  competitive  prices  or  may  fail  to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.\n\nWe depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we have no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits.\n\nWe  buy  from  numerous  domestic  and  foreign  manufacturers  and  importers.  Our  inability  to  acquire  suitable merchandise  on  acceptable  terms  or  the  loss  of  key  suppliers  could  negatively  affect  us.  We  may  not  be  able  to develop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternative sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensive. Because of our efforts to adhere to high quality standards for which available supply may be limited, particularly for certain food items, the large volumes we demand may not be consistently available.\n\nOur suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and services) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activities, financial liquidity, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions that could limit their ability to timely provide us with acceptable  merchandise.  One  or  more  of  our  suppliers  might  not  adhere  to  our  quality  control,  packaging,  legal, regulatory,  labor,  environmental  or  animal  welfare  standards.  These  deficiencies  may  delay  or  preclude  delivery  of merchandise to us and might not be identified before we sell such merchandise to our members. This failure could lead to recalls and litigation and otherwise damage our reputation and our brands, increase costs, and otherwise adversely impact our business.",

      "answer": "Costco's membership fee revenue grew by 9% in 2022, reaching $4,224, driven by new sign-ups, Executive upgrades, and higher renewal rates. However, this growth was partially offset by a $42 negative impact from foreign exchange fluctuations, indicating that the actual underlying growth was stronger than the reported 9%. This is consistent with the company's revenue recognition policy, where membership fees are accounted for on a deferred basis and recognized ratably over the one-year membership period, ensuring that revenue is smoothed out and aligned with the service period rather than being recognized upfront. This policy supports the financial reporting by allowing for a more stable and predictable revenue stream despite external factors like currency volatility.",

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Translation adjustments are  recorded  in  accumulated  other  comprehensive  loss.  Revenues  and  expenses  of  the  Company's  consolidated foreign operations are translated at average exchange rates prevailing during the year.\n\nThe Company recognizes foreign-currency transaction gains and losses related to revaluing or settling monetary assets and  liabilities  denominated  in  currencies  other  than  the  functional  currency  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the consolidated statements of income. Generally, these include the U.S. dollar cash and cash equivalents and the U.S. dollar  payables of consolidated subsidiaries revalued to their functional currency. Also included are realized foreigncurrency gains or losses from settlements of forward foreign-exchange contracts. These items were $84 in 2022 and immaterial in 2021 and 2020.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe  Company  recognizes  sales  for  the  amount  of  consideration  collected  from  the  member,  which  includes  gross shipping fees where applicable, and is net of sales taxes collected and remitted to government agencies and member returns. The Company reserves for estimated returns based on historical trends in merchandise returns and reduces sales and merchandise costs accordingly. The Company records, on a gross basis, a refund liability and an asset for recovery,  which  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  and  other  current  assets,  respectively,  in  the  consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe Company offers merchandise in the following core merchandise categories: foods and sundries, non-foods, and fresh  foods.  The  Company  also  provides  expanded  products  and  services  through  warehouse  ancillary  and  other businesses. The majority of revenue from merchandise sales is recognized at the point of sale. Revenue generated through e-commerce or special orders is generally recognized upon shipment to the member. For merchandise shipped directly  to  the  member,  shipping  and  handling  costs  are  expensed  as  incurred  as  fulfillment  costs  and  included  in merchandise costs in the consolidated statements of income. In certain ancillary businesses, revenue is deferred until the  member  picks  up  merchandise  at  the  warehouse.  Deferred  sales  are  included  in  other  current  liabilities  in  the consolidated balance sheets.\n\nThe  Company  is  the  principal  for  the  majority  of  its  transactions  and  recognizes  revenue  on  a  gross  basis.  The Company is the principal when it has control of the merchandise or service before it is transferred to the member, which generally  is  established  when  Costco  is  primarily  responsible  for  merchandising  decisions,  pricing  discretion,  and maintains the relationship with the member, including assurance of member service and satisfaction.\n\nThe Company accounts for membership fee revenue, net of refunds, on a deferred basis, ratably over the one-year membership period. Deferred membership fees at the end of 2022 and 2021 were $2,174 and $2,042, respectively.\n\nIn most countries, the Company's Executive members qualify for a 2% reward on qualified purchases, subject to an annual maximum value, which does not expire and is redeemable at Costco warehouses. The Company accounts for this reward as a reduction in sales, net of the estimated impact of non-redemptions (breakage), with the corresponding liability  classified  as  accrued member rewards in the consolidated balance sheets. Estimated breakage is computed based on redemption data. For  2022,  2021,  and  2020,  the  net  reduction  in  sales  was  $2,307,  $2,047,  and  $1,707 respectively.",

      "answer": "Costco utilizes its wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary to manage retained risk exposures, such as employee health care, workers' compensation, and general liability. The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the company's premium costs in selling, general, and administrative expenses, indicating a direct financial impact on operating costs. The liabilities associated with these risks are estimated using historical claims, demographic factors, and actuarial assumptions, totaling $1,364 million at the end of 2022. These liabilities are not discounted and are subject to potential volatility based on unforeseen developments. Meanwhile, the captive's investment strategy is limited to U.S. government and government agency obligations and money market funds, aligning with the company\u2019s conservative approach to capital preservation and liquidity. This integrated structure shows a coordinated effort to manage both risk exposure and financial stability through controlled premium flows, conservative liability estimation, and low-risk asset allocation.",

See Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report for more information on our long-term debt.\n\n## Foreign Currency Risk\n\nOur foreign subsidiaries conduct certain transactions in non-functional currencies, which exposes us to fluctuations in exchange rates. We manage these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact of these fluctuations on known future expenditures denominated in a non-functional foreign-currency.  The  contracts  are  intended  primarily  to  economically  hedge  exposure  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise inventory expenditures made by our international subsidiaries. We seek to mitigate risk with the use of these contracts and do not intend to engage in speculative transactions. For additional information related to the Company's forward foreign-exchange  contracts,  see  Notes  1  and  3  to  the  consolidated  financial  statements  included  in  Item  8  of  this Report. A hypothetical 10% strengthening of the functional currency compared to the non-functional currency exchange rates at August 28, 2022, would have decreased the fair value of the contracts by $128 and resulted in an unrealized loss in the consolidated statements of income for the same amount.\n\n## Commodity Price Risk\n\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in prices for energy, particularly electricity and natural gas, and other commodities used in retail and manufacturing operations, which we seek to partially mitigate through fixed-price contracts for certain of our warehouses and other facilities, predominantly in the U.S. and Canada. We also enter into variable-priced contracts for some purchases of electricity and natural gas, in addition to some of the fuel for our gas stations, on an index basis. These contracts meet the characteristics of derivative instruments, but generally qualify for the 'normal purchases and normal sales' exception under authoritative guidance and require no mark-to-market adjustment.",

Insurance coverage is maintained for certain risks to limit exposures arising from very large losses. The Company uses different  risk  management  mechanisms,  including  a  wholly-owned  captive  insurance  subsidiary  (the  captive)  and participates in a reinsurance program. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted  and  are  estimated,  in  part,  by  considering  historical  claims  experience,  demographic  factors,  severity factors, and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. At the end of 2022 and 2021, these insurance liabilities were $1,364 and $1,257 in the aggregate, respectively, and were included in accrued salaries and benefits and other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets, classified based on their nature.\n\nThe captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company's premium costs in selling, general and administrative expenses, in the consolidated statements of income. The captive participates in a reinsurance program that includes other third-party participants. The reinsurance agreement is one year in duration, and new agreements are entered into by each participant at their discretion at the commencement of the next calendar year. The participant agreements and practices of the reinsurance program are designed to limit a participating members' individual risk. Income statement adjustments related to the reinsurance program and related impacts to the consolidated balance sheets are recognized as information becomes known. In the event the Company leaves the reinsurance program, the Company retains its primary obligation to the policyholders for prior activity.\n\n## Derivatives\n\nThe Company is exposed to foreign-currency exchange-rate fluctuations in the normal course of business. It manages these fluctuations, in part, through the use of forward foreign-exchange contracts, seeking to economically hedge the impact  of  fluctuations  of  foreign  exchange  on  known  future  expenditures  denominated  in  a  non-functional  foreigncurrency. The  contracts  relate  primarily  to  U.S.  dollar  merchandise  inventory  expenditures  made  by  the  Company's international subsidiaries with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Currently, these contracts do not qualify for  derivative  hedge  accounting. The  Company  seeks  to  mitigate  risk  with  the  use  of  these  contracts  and  does  not intend to engage in speculative transactions. Some of these contracts contain credit-risk-related contingent features that require settlement of outstanding contracts upon certain triggering events. The aggregate fair value amounts of derivative  instruments  in  a  net  liability  position  and  the  amount  needed  to  settle  the  instruments  immediately  if  the credit-risk-related  contingent  features  were  triggered  were  immaterial  at  the  end  of  2022.  There  were  no  derivative instruments in a net liability position at the end of 2021. The aggregate notional amounts of open, unsettled forward foreign-exchange  contracts  were  $1,242  and  $1,331  at  the  end  of  2022  and  2021,  respectively.  See  Note  3  for information on the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts at the end of 2022 and 2021.\n\nThe  unrealized  gains  or  losses  recognized  in  interest  income  and  other,  net  in  the  accompanying  consolidated statements of income relating to the net changes in the fair value of unsettled forward foreign-exchange contracts were immaterial in 2022, 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe  Company  is  exposed  to  fluctuations  in  prices  for  energy,  particularly  electricity  and  natural  gas,  and  other commodity products used in retail and manufacturing operations, which it seeks to partially mitigate through the use of fixed-price contracts for certain of its warehouses and other facilities, primarily in the U.S. and Canada.

This margin pressure is observed across all segments, as noted in the segment reporting, where all segments were negatively impacted by decreases in core merchandise categories. Despite this shared challenge, Costco's operating model remains largely consistent across U.S., Canadian, and Other International segments, with similar structures in membership, warehouse operations, and cost control strategies. However, localized variations such as higher e-commerce penetration in the U.S. (which typically carries a lower gross margin percentage) and slower square footage growth (which reduces cannibalization but limits expansion) may compound margin pressures in the U.S. segment compared to other regions with higher growth rates and lower wage costs.",

Excluding the impact of gasoline price inflation on net sales, gross margin was 10.94%, a decrease of 19 basis points. This was primarily due to a 33 basispoint  decrease  in  core  merchandise  categories,  predominantly  driven  by  decreases  in  fresh  foods  and  foods  and sundries, and 19 basis points due to a LIFO charge for higher merchandise costs. Gross margin was also negatively impacted  by  one  basis  point  due  to  increased  2%  rewards.  Warehouse  ancillary  and  other  businesses  positively impacted gross margin by 29 basis points, predominantly gasoline, partially offset by e-commerce. Gross margin was positively impacted by five basis points due to the net impact of ceasing incremental wages related to COVID-19 and the  negative  impact  of  a  one-time  charge  related  to  granting  our  employees  one  additional  day  of  paid  time  off. Changes in  foreign  currencies  relative  to  the  U.S.  dollar  negatively  impacted  gross  margin  by  approximately  $176, compared to 2021, primarily attributable to our Other International Operations.\n\nThe gross margin in core merchandise categories, when expressed as a percentage of core merchandise sales (rather than total net sales), decreased 27 basis points.

Generally, rising gasoline prices benefit net sales growth which, given the higher sales base, negatively impacts our gross margin percentage but decreases our SG&amp;A expenses as a percentage of net sales. A decline in gasoline prices has the inverse effect. Additionally, actions in various countries, particularly China and the United  States,  have  affected  the  costs  of  some  of  our  merchandise.  The  degree  of  our  exposure  is  dependent  on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. Higher tariffs could adversely impact our results.\n\nWe also achieve net sales growth by opening new warehouses. As our warehouse base grows, available and desirable sites become more difficult to secure, and square footage growth becomes a comparatively less substantial component of growth. The negative aspects of such growth, however, including lower initial operating profitability relative to existing warehouses  and  cannibalization  of  sales  at  existing  warehouses  when  openings  occur  in  existing  markets,  are continuing to decline in significance as they relate to the results of our total operations. Our rate of square footage growth is generally higher in foreign markets, due to the smaller base in those markets, and we expect that to continue. Our e-commerce business growth, domestically and internationally, has also increased our sales but it generally has a lower  gross  margin  percentage  relative  to  our  warehouse  operations.  E-commerce  sales  growth  slowed  in  2022 compared to 2021 and 2020.\n\nThe membership format is an integral part of our business and has a significant effect on our profitability. This format is designed to reinforce member loyalty and provide continuing fee revenue. The extent to which we achieve growth in our membership base, increase the penetration of our Executive members, and sustain high renewal rates materially influences our profitability. Our paid membership growth rate may be adversely impacted when warehouse openings occur in existing markets as compared to new markets.\n\nOur financial performance depends heavily on controlling costs. While we believe that we have achieved successes in this  area,  some  significant  costs  are  partially  outside  our  control,  particularly  health  care  and  utility  expenses.  With respect to the compensation of our employees, our philosophy is not to seek to minimize their wages and benefits. Rather, we believe that achieving our longer-term objectives of reducing employee turnover and enhancing employee satisfaction  requires  maintaining  compensation  levels  that  are  better  than  the  industry  average  for  much  of  our workforce. This may cause us, for example, to absorb costs that other employers might seek to pass through to their workforces. Because our business operates on very low margins, modest changes in various items in the consolidated statements  of  income,  particularly  merchandise  costs  and  SG&amp;A  expenses,  can  have  substantial  impacts  on  net income.\n\nOur operating model is generally the same across our U.S., Canadian, and Other International operating segments (see Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Report). Certain operations in the Other International  segment  have  relatively  higher  rates  of  square  footage  growth,  lower  wage  and  benefit  costs  as  a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business delivery.\n\nIn discussions of our consolidated operating results, we refer to the impact of changes in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, which are the differences between the foreign-exchange rates we use to convert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into U.S. dollars. This impact of foreign-exchange rate changes is calculated based on the difference between the current period's currency exchange rates and that of the comparable prior period. The impact of changes in gasoline prices on net sales is calculated based on the difference between the current period's average price per gallon sold and that of the comparable prior period.\n\nOur fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to August 31.

To counteract this challenge, Costco implemented a strategy of increasing membership fees across tiers\u2014raising the Gold Star and Business memberships from $60 to $65, and the Executive membership from $120 to $130 (page_27). These fee increases are expected to generate approximately $370 million in additional revenue over the next two years, with $190 million benefiting fiscal 2025, which may help offset lower retention in newer markets. Additionally, Costco emphasized the growth in Executive membership penetration, which reached 73.3% of worldwide net sales in 2024 (page_6), as a key factor in improving renewal rates. Executive members receive a 2% reward (up to $1,250 annually), which enhances member value and loyalty.

Certain operations in the Other International segment hav e relativ ely higher rates of square footage growth, lower wage and benefit costs as a percentage of sales, less or no direct membership warehouse competition, or lack e-commerce or business deliv ery.\n\nIn  discussions  of  our  consolidated  operating  results,  we  refer  to  the  impact  of  changes  in  foreign  currencies  relativ e  to  the  U.S.  dollar ,  which  are differences between the foreign exchange rates we use to conv ert the financial results of our international operations from local currencies into  U.S. dollars.  T his  impact is calculated based on the difference between the current and prior period's exchange rates. The impact of changes in gasoline prices  on  net  sales  is  calculated  based  on  the  difference  between  the  current  and  prior  period's  av erage  price  per  gallon  sold.  Results  expressed excluding the impacts of foreign exchange and gasoline prices are intended as supplemental information and are not a substitute for net sales presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should be rev iewed in conjunction with results reported in accordance with U.S. GAAP.",

Despite these risks, the financial statements on page 44 show that merchandise inventories increased by $1.996 billion (from $16,651 million in 2023 to $18,647 million in 2024), indicating strong inventory acquisition and growth. However, the deferred tax liabilities section on page 58 shows that the tax treatment of merchandise inventories contributed a $296 million liability in 2024 (down from $380 million in 2023), suggesting a reduction in the tax burden related to inventory valuation methods. This combination implies that while COST is expanding its inventory holdings amid supply risks, it is also managing the associated tax implications effectively, potentially through cost basis timing or other tax deferral strategies.",

Additionally, trade-related actions in v arious countries, particularly China and the United States, hav e affected the costs of some of our merchandise. The degree of our exposure is dependent on (among other things) the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of the tariffs. T he impact to our net sales and gross margin is influenced in part by our merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases. Higher tariffs could adv ersely impact our results.\n\nPrices of certain commodities, including gasoline and consumable goods used in manufacturing and our warehouse retail operations, are historically volatile  and  are  subject  to  fluctuations  arising  from  changes  in  domestic  and  international  supply  and  demand,  inflationary  pressures,  labor  costs, competition, market speculation, gov ernment regulations, taxes and periodic delays in deliv ery. Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices and our ability and desire to pass them through to our members may affect our sales and profit margins. These factors could also increase our merchandise costs and selling, general and administrativ e expenses, and otherwise adv ersely affect our operations and financial results. General economic conditions can also be affected by ev ents like the outbreak of hostilities or acts of terrorism.\n\nInflationary factors such as increases in merchandise costs may adv ersely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to adjust prices to sufficiently offset the effect of cost increases without negativ ely impacting consumer demand.\n\nSuppliers may be unable to timely supply us with quality merchandise at competitive prices or may fail to adhere to our high standards, resulting in adverse effects on our business, merchandise inventories, sales, and profit margins.\n\nWe depend heavily on our ability to purchase quality merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitiv e prices. As the quantities we require continue to grow, we hav e no assurances of continued supply, appropriate pricing or access to new products, and any supplier has the ability to change the terms upon which they sell to us or discontinue selling to us. Member demands may lead to out-of-stock positions causing a loss of sales and profits.\n\nWe buy from numerous domestic and foreign suppliers and importers. Our inability to acquire suitable merchandise on acceptable terms or the loss of key suppliers could negativ ely affect us. We may not be able to dev elop relationships with new suppliers, and products from alternativ e sources, if any, may be of a lesser quality or more expensiv e.  Because of our efforts to adhere to high-quality standards for which av ailable supply may be limited, particularly  for  certain  food  items,  the  large  v olumes  we  demand  may  not  be  consistently  av ailable.  Our  efforts  to  secure  supply  could  lead  to commitments that prove to be unsuccessful in the short and long-term.\n\nOur suppliers (and those they depend upon for materials and serv ices) are subject to risks, including labor disputes, union organizing activ ities, human and animal rights v iolations, financial liquidity, climate change, natural disasters, extreme weather conditions, env ironmental degradation, public health emergencies, supply constraints and general economic and political conditions and other risks similar to those we face that could limit their ability to timely prov ide us with acceptable merchandise. One or more of our suppliers might not adhere to our quality control, packaging, legal, regulatory, labor, human rights, env ironmental or animal welfare standards.

This suggests that despite the acknowledged risk of brand-related attrition, Costco has successfully maintained strong member loyalty and is leveraging pricing power to grow this high-margin revenue stream, which aligns with the overall profitability improvements seen in the 17% increase in net income to $7,367 million in 2024.",

      "question": "Given Costco's consistent year-over-year growth in membership fees, how does the combination of membership structure details, financial performance data, and renewal trends provide insight into the sustainability of this revenue stream and its contribution to overall profitability?",
      "answer": "Costco's membership fees increased by 5% in 2024 to $4,828 million, continuing a trend of steady growth (8% in 2023 and 9% in 2022). This growth is supported by a strong membership structure that includes Gold Star, Business, and Executive memberships, with Executive members contributing approximately 73.3% of worldwide net sales and paying an additional $60 annual fee for a 2% reward on qualified purchases. Despite being a relatively small portion of total revenue compared to net sales, membership fees are highly profitable as they contribute directly to operating income, which reached $9,285 million in 2024. The high global renewal rate of 90.5% (92.9% in the U.S. and Canada) indicates strong member retention and loyalty, reinforcing the sustainability of this revenue stream. Together, these factors suggest that membership fees are a stable and growing contributor to Costco\u2019s profitability.",

      "answer": "Costco's special dividend of $15 per share in 2024, which resulted in a $6,655 payout, was a major component of its financing activities, contributing to the $10,764 net cash used in financing activities for the year. This significant dividend payment was partially supported by proceeds from short-term borrowings and Guaranteed Senior Notes issued by its Japan subsidiary. The special dividend also had a tax implication, generating a discrete tax benefit of $94 related to the portion of the dividend payable through the 401(k) plan. Despite the large cash outlay on dividends, Costco maintained a capital allocation strategy that balanced this with its share repurchase program, which still had $2,865 remaining under the $4,000 authorization at the end of 2024, indicating continued flexibility in returning value to shareholders while managing liquidity.",

On May 18, 2024, we paid the $1,000 outstanding principal balance on the 2.750% Senior Notes, using cash and cash equiv alents and shortterm inv estments. Cash flow prov ided by financing activ ities included proceeds from short-term borrowings and four Guaranteed Senior Notes totaling approximately $500, at fixed interest rates ranging from 1.400% to 2.120%, issued by our Japan subsidiary.\n\n## Dividends\n\nCash dividends declared in 2024 totaled $8,589 or $19.36 per share, as compared to $1,703 or $3.84 per share in 2023. Div idends in 2024 included a special div idend of $15 per share, resulting in a payment of approximately $6,655. In April 2024, the Board of Directors increased our quarterly cash div idend from $1.02 to $1.16 per share.\n\n## Share Repurchase Program\n\nOn January 19, 2023, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program in the amount of $4,000, which expires in January 2027. During 2024 and 2023, we repurchased 1,004,000 and 1,341,000 shares of common stock, at an average price per share of $695.29 and $504.68, totaling approximately $698 and $677. These amounts may differ from the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows due to changes in unsettled repurchases at the end of each fiscal year. Purchases are made from time to time, as conditions warrant, in the open market or in block purchases, pursuant  to  plans  under  SEC  Rule  10b5-1.  Repurchased  shares  are  retired,  in  accordance  with  the  Washington  Business  Corporation  Act.  T he remaining amount av ailable to be purchased under our approv ed plan was $2,865 at the end of 2024.\n\n## Bank Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Programs\n\nWe maintain bank credit facilities for working capital and general corporate purposes. At September 1, 2024, we had borrowing capacity under these facilities  of  $1,198.  Our  international  operations  maintain  $710  of  this  capacity  under  bank  credit  facilities,  of  which  $167  is  guaranteed  by  the Company. Short-term borrowings outstanding under the bank credit facilities, which are included in other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, were immaterial at the end of 2024 and 2023.\n\nWe have letter of credit facilities, for commercial and standby letters of credit, totaling $214. T he outstanding commitments under these facilities at the end of 2024 totaled $193, most of which were standby letters of credit that do not expire or hav e expiration dates within one year.  The bank credit facilities hav e v arious expiration dates, most within one year, and we generally intend to renew these facilities. T he amount of borrowings av ailable at any time under our bank credit facilities is reduced by the amount of standby and commercial letters of credit outstanding.\n\n## Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\n\nIn the opinion of management, we hav e no off-balance sheet arrangements that hav e had or are reasonably likely to hav e a material current or future effect on our financial condition or financial statements.",

      "question": "How does The Coca-Cola Company's treatment of tax litigation expense in 2023 and 2024 reflect both a charge and a net benefit across different financial disclosures, and what does this reveal about the evolving nature of the expense and management's estimate revisions?",
      "answer": "In 2023, The Coca-Cola Company reported an $8 million charge related to tax litigation expense, indicating a negative financial impact. However, in 2024, this shifted to a net benefit of $2 million due to revisions in management's estimates, suggesting that the company adjusted its financial outlook on the same item. This evolution reveals that the tax litigation expense is not static and is subject to ongoing reassessment based on new information or developments in the litigation process. The shift from a charge to a benefit indicates that the company may have gained more clarity or reached a more favorable interim position in the litigation, reducing the estimated financial burden.",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola paid $6.0 billion in September 2024 to the IRS in response to a Tax Court decision related to the 2007\u20132009 tax years, which was recorded as a noncurrent asset with the expectation of a potential refund if the Company's positions are upheld on appeal. This payment is separate from the $474 million tax reserve recorded as of December 31, 2024, which reflects the Company's estimate of probable tax liabilities based on alternative methodologies and ongoing litigation risk. Meanwhile, the Company holds $2.253 billion in Internal Revenue Code 163(j) interest carryforwards that can be used indefinitely to offset future interest expenses, potentially mitigating the financial impact of any sustained liabilities. Together, these figures illustrate a layered financial strategy where the upfront deposit stops interest accrual, the reserve reflects ongoing uncertainty, and the carryforwards provide long-term flexibility in managing potential outcomes of the litigation.",

On November 8, 2023, the Tax Court issued a supplemental opinion (together with the original Tax Court opinion, 'Opinions'), siding with the IRS in concluding both that certain U.S. tax regulations (known as the blocked-income regulations) that address the effect of certain Brazilian legal restrictions on royalty payments by the Company's licensee in Brazil apply to the Company's operations and that the Tax Court opinion in 3M Co. &amp; Subs. v. Commissioner (February 9, 2023) controlled as to the validity of those regulations.\n\nThe Company believes that the IRS and the Tax Court misinterpreted and misapplied the applicable regulations in reallocating income earned by the Company's foreign licensees to increase the Company's U.S. tax. Moreover, the Company believes that the retroactive imposition of such tax liability using a calculation methodology different from that previously agreed upon by the IRS and the Company, and audited by the IRS for over a decade, is unconstitutional. The Company intends to assert its claims on appeal and vigorously defend its positions. In addition, for its litigation with the IRS and for purposes of its appeal of the Tax  Court decision, the Company is currently evaluating the implications of several significant administrative law cases recently decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, most notably Loper Bright v. Raimondo , which overruled Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. NRDC (' Chevron '). Since 1984, Chevron had required that courts defer to agency interpretations of statutes and agency action. In Ohio v. EPA and Garland v. Cargill , two of the recent decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court demonstrated how courts are to rule on agency interpretations and actions without the deference previously required by Chevron .\n\nOn August 2, 2024, the Tax Court entered a decision reflecting additional federal income tax of $2.7 billion for the 2007 through 2009 tax  years. With applicable interest, the total liability for the 2007 through 2009 tax  years resulting from the Tax  Court's decision is $6.0 billion, for which the IRS issued the Company invoices on September 3, 2024. The Company paid those invoices ('IRS Tax Litigation Deposit') on September 10, 2024, which stopped interest from accruing on the additional tax due for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. That amount, plus interest earned, would be refunded in full or in part if the Company's tax positions are ultimately sustained on appeal. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded net interest income of $77 million related to this tax payment in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income, in accordance with our accounting policy. The payment of the IRS invoices and the related accrued interest were recorded in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. On October 22, 2024, the Company appealed the Tax Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes . In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinions and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company's tax positions, that it is more likely than not the Company's tax  positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinions ('Tax Court Methodology'), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company's tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the different tax  treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in reliance upon the Closing Agreement, that would be recharacterized as royalties in accordance with the Opinions and the Company's analysis.\n\nThe Company's conclusion that it is more likely than not the Company's tax positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal is unchanged as of December 31, 2024. However, based on the required probability analysis and the accrual of interest through the current reporting period, we updated our tax reserve as of December 31, 2024 to $474 million.\n\nWhile the Company strongly disagrees with the IRS' positions and the portions of the Opinions affirming such positions, it is possible that some portion or all of the adjustments proposed by the IRS and sustained by the Tax Court could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would not receive a refund of the applicable portion or all of the $6.0 billion it paid in response to the IRS invoices issued in September 2024 and the related accrued interest receivable of $103 million as of December 31, 2024. Additionally, the Company would likely be subject to significant additional liabilities for subsequent years, which could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n\nThe Company calculated the potential impact of applying the Tax Court Methodology to reallocate income from foreign licensees potentially covered within the scope of the Opinions for the 2010 through 2024 tax years, assuming such methodology were to be ultimately upheld by the courts, and the IRS were to decide to apply that methodology to subsequent years, with",

Consistent with the Closing Agreement, the IRS did not assert penalties, and it has yet to do so.\n\nThe IRS designated the Company's matter for litigation on October 15, 2015. Litigation designation is an IRS determination that forecloses to a company any and all alternative means for resolution of a tax  dispute. As a result of the IRS' designation of the Company's matter for litigation, the Company was forced to either accept the IRS' newly imposed tax assessment and pay the full amount of the asserted tax or litigate the matter in the federal courts. The matter remains subject to the IRS' litigation designation, preventing the Company from any attempt to settle or otherwise mutually resolve the matter with the IRS.\n\nThe Company consequently initiated litigation by filing a petition in the Tax Court in December 2015, challenging the tax adjustments enumerated in the Notice.\n\nPrior to trial, the IRS increased its transfer pricing adjustment by $385 million, resulting in an additional tax  adjustment of $135 million. The Company obtained a summary judgment in its favor on a different matter related to Mexican foreign tax credits, which thereafter effectively reduced the IRS' potential tax  adjustment by $138 million.\n\nThe trial was held in the Tax  Court from March through May 2018, and final post-trial briefs were filed and ex changed in April 2019.\n\nOn November 18, 2020, the Tax Court issued the Opinion in which it predominantly sided with the IRS but agreed with the Company that dividends previously paid by the foreign licensees to the U.S. parent company in reliance upon the Closing Agreement should continue to be allowed to offset royalties, including those that would become payable to the Company in accordance with the Opinion.

With applicable interest, the total liability for the 2007 through 2009 tax  years resulting from the Tax  Court's decision is $6.0 billion, for which the IRS issued the Company invoices on September 3, 2024. The Company paid those invoices ('IRS Tax Litigation Deposit') on September 10, 2024, which stopped interest from accruing on the additional tax due for the 2007 through 2009 tax years. That amount, plus interest earned, would be refunded in full or in part if the Company's tax positions are ultimately sustained on appeal. For the year ended December 31, 2024, the Company recorded net interest income of $77 million related to this tax payment in the line item income taxes in our consolidated statement of income, in accordance with our accounting policy. The payment of the IRS invoices and the related accrued interest were recorded in the line item other noncurrent assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024. On October 22, 2024, the Company appealed the Tax Court's decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit.\n\nIn determining the amount of tax reserve to be recorded as of December 31, 2020, the Company completed the required two-step evaluation process prescribed by Accounting Standards Codification 740, Accounting for Income Taxes . In doing so, we consulted with outside advisors, and we reviewed and considered relevant laws, rules, and regulations, including, but not limited to, the Opinions and relevant caselaw. We also considered our intention to vigorously defend our positions and assert our various well-founded legal claims via every available avenue of appeal. We concluded, based on the technical and legal merits of the Company's tax positions, that it is more likely than not the Company's tax  positions will ultimately be sustained on appeal. In addition, we considered a number of alternative transfer pricing methodologies, including the methodology asserted by the IRS and affirmed in the Opinions ('Tax Court Methodology'), that could be applied by the courts upon final resolution of the litigation. Based on the required probability analysis, we determined the methodologies we believe the federal courts could ultimately order to be used in calculating the Company's tax. As a result of this analysis, we recorded a tax reserve of $438 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 related to the application of the resulting methodologies as well as the different tax  treatment applicable to dividends originally paid to the U.S. parent company by its foreign licensees, in",

      "answer": "The BodyArmor trademark was initially valued at $4.2 billion in 2021 when Coca-Cola acquired full ownership of BA Sports Nutrition, LLC. By 2024, the Company recorded a $760 million impairment charge due to revised projections of future operating results and higher discount rates driven by macroeconomic changes since the acquisition. This reflects a significant downward adjustment in the expected performance and valuation of the brand, despite the fact that as of December 31, 2024, the fair value of the trademark approximated its carrying value of $3,400 million.

          "chunk_text": "Intangible assets acquired in recent transactions are naturally more susceptible to impairment, because they are recorded at fair value based on recent operating plans and macroeconomic conditions present at the time of acquisition. Consequently, if operating results and/or macroeconomic conditions deteriorate shortly after an acquisition, it could result in the impairment of the acquired assets. A deterioration of macroeconomic conditions may not only negatively impact the estimated operating cash flows used in our cash flow models but may also negatively impact other assumptions used in our analyses, including, but not limited to, the discount rates. If the discount rates change, our Company may recognize an impairment of an intangible asset in spite of realizing actual cash flows that are equal to, or greater than, our previously forecasted amounts. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent acquisitions, if applicable.\n\nIn November 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 85% ownership interest in, and now owns 100% of BA Sports Nutrition, LLC ('BodyArmor'), which offers a line of sports performance and hydration beverages. During 2021, in conjunction with acquiring the remaining ownership interest, we recognized a noncash gain of $834 million resulting from the remeasurement of our previously held equity interest in BodyArmor to fair value. The Company allocated $4.2 billion of the $5.6 billion purchase price to the BodyArmor trademark. During the three months ended March 29, 2024, the operating results related to the trademark were lower than expected. Therefore, the Company revised its projections of the future operating results related to the trademark, which triggered the need to update its impairment analysis. As a result, the Company concluded that the fair value of the trademark was less than its carrying value and recorded an impairment charge of $760 million. The decrease in fair value was primarily driven by the revised projections of future operating results as well as higher discount rates resulting from changes in macroeconomic conditions since the acquisition date. As of December 31, 2024, the fair value of this trademark approximates its carrying value. If the near-term operating results of this trademark do not achieve our revised financial projections, or if the macroeconomic conditions change, causing the discount rate to increase without an offsetting increase in the operating results, it is likely that we would be required to recognize an additional impairment charge. Management will continue to monitor the fair value of this trademark in future periods.\n\n## Pension Plan Valuations\n\nOur Company sponsors a qualified pension plan covering substantially all U.S. employees as well as unfunded nonqualified pension plans for certain employees in the United States. In addition, our Company and its subsidiaries have various pension plans outside the United States.\n\nManagement is required to make certain critical estimates related to the actuarial assumptions used to determine our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income. We believe the two most critical assumptions are the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our actuarial assumptions are reviewed annually, or more frequently to the extent that a settlement or curtailment occurs. Changes in these assumptions could have a material impact on the measurement of our pension obligations and our net periodic pension cost or income.\n\nThe discount rate assumption used to account for pension plans reflects the rate at which the benefit obligations could be effectively settled. The discount rate for U.S. and certain non-U.S. plans is determined using a matching technique whereby the rates of a yield curve, developed from high-quality debt securities, are applied to projected benefit cash flows to determine the appropriate effective discount rate. For other non-U.S. plans, we base the discount rate assumption on comparable indices within each of the respective countries. The Company measures the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension cost or income by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve to the plans' projected cash flows.\n\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based upon the long-term outlook of our investment strategy as well as our historical returns and volatilities for each asset class. We also review current levels of interest rates and inflation to assess the reasonableness of our ex pected long-term rate of return on plan assets. Our investment objective for our pension assets is to ensure all funded pension plans have sufficient assets to meet their benefit obligations when they become due. As a result, the Company periodically revises asset allocations, where appropriate, to seek to improve returns and manage risk.\n\nIn 2024, the Company's total net periodic pension cost was $45 million. In 2025, we expect our net periodic pension cost to be approximately $81 million. The increase in net periodic pension cost is primarily due to a lower ex pected return on assets resulting from a transfer of $523 million of surplus international plan assets from pension trusts to general assets of the Company in 2024.\n\nAs of December 31, 2024, the U.S. qualified pension plan represented 64% and 58% of the Company's consolidated projected benefit obligation and pension plan assets, respectively. For this plan, we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the discount rate would result in a $7 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost, and we estimate that a 50 basis-point decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would result in an $18 million increase in our 2025 net periodic pension cost.\n\nRefer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our pension plans and related actuarial assumptions.",

      "question": "Given Coca-Cola's $28.7 billion in international revenues, how does the company's exposure to foreign currency fluctuations, as evidenced by a 5% revenue decline in 2024, reconcile with the potential for regulatory compliance costs in international markets to further reduce net operating revenues, especially in light of the company's reliance on acquisitions and third-party partners to drive growth in these same regions?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's international operations generated $28.7 billion in net operating revenues in 2024, but this figure was reduced by a 5% decline due to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. The company actively hedges these exposures through derivative financial instruments with a total notional value of $18,442 million as of year-end 2024. However, regulatory compliance costs in international markets also pose a risk to net operating revenues, particularly as evolving laws around data privacy (e.g., GDPR, China's Personal Information Protection Law), environmental regulations (e.g., plastic restrictions, carbon emissions), and labor practices could increase operating costs or require product reformulations. These regulatory risks are especially relevant in the context of Coca-Cola's growth strategy, which includes expanding through acquisitions and strategic partnerships in international markets. The integration of these new operations has previously led to increased costs and operational challenges, suggesting that foreign exchange pressures could compound difficulties in realizing expected synergies from international acquisitions, thereby creating a dual risk to net operating revenues.",

The total impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating income, including the effect of our hedging activities, was a decrease of 11% and 8% in 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\nForeign currency exchange gains and losses are primarily the result of the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities from certain currencies into functional currencies. The effects of the remeasurement of these assets and liabilities are partially offset by the impact of our economic hedging program for certain exposures on our consolidated balance sheet. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Foreign currency exchange gains and losses are recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income. Refer to the heading 'Operations Review - Other Income (Loss) - Net' above. The Company recorded net foreign currency exchange losses of $180 million and $312 million during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively.\n\n## Impact of Inflation and Changing Prices\n\nInflation affects the way we operate in many markets around the world. In general, we believe that, over time, we will be able to increase prices to counteract the majority of the inflationary effects of increasing costs and to generate sufficient cash flows to maintain our productive capability.\n\n## ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\n\nOur Company uses derivative financial instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market risks. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. As a matter of policy, all of our derivative positions are used to reduce risk by hedging an underlying economic exposure. Because of the high correlation between the hedging instruments and the underlying exposures, fluctuations in the values of the instruments are generally offset by reciprocal changes in the values of the underlying exposures.\n\nWe monitor our exposure to market risks using several objective measurement systems, including a sensitivity analysis to measure our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices. Refer to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information about our hedging transactions and derivative financial instruments.\n\n## Foreign Currency Exchange Rates\n\nWe manage most of our foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis, which allows us to net certain exposures and take advantage of any natural offsets. In 2024, we generated $28.7 billion of our net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\n\nOur Company enters into forward exchange contracts and purchases foreign currency options and collars (principally euro, British pound and Japanese yen) to hedge certain portions of forecasted cash flows denominated in foreign currencies. Additionally, we enter into forward exchange contracts to offset the earnings impact related to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities. We also enter into forward exchange contracts as hedges of net investments in foreign operations.\n\nThe total notional values of our foreign currency derivatives were $18,442 million and $17,505 million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively. These values included derivative instruments that were designated and qualified for hedge accounting along with derivative instruments that are economic hedges. The fair value of foreign currency derivatives that qualified for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $366 million as of December 31, 2024, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $511 million decrease in fair value. The fair value of the foreign currency derivatives that did not qualify for hedge accounting resulted in a net unrealized gain of $62 million as of December 31, 2024, and we estimate that a 10% weakening of the U.S. dollar would have resulted in a $325 million decrease in fair value.\n\n## Interest Rates\n\nThe Company is subject to interest rate volatility with regard to ex isting and future issuances of debt. We monitor our mix  of fix ed-rate and variable-rate debt as well as our mix of short-term debt and long-term debt. From time to time, we enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations.",

The legal and regulatory landscape for certain new technologies, such as artificial intelligence, is uncertain and evolving, and our compliance obligations could increase our costs or limit how we may use these technologies. Failure to comply with various laws and regulations (or allegations thereof), such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations; antitrust and competition laws; anti-modern slavery laws; anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws; data privacy laws, including the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation and China's Personal Information Protection Law; tax laws and regulations; and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws, could result in litigation or criminal or civil enforcement actions, including voluntary and involuntary document requests, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, the suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or the cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2024, we derived $28.7 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at ex change rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Global events, including political instability, international conflicts, trade disputes, economic sanctions, inflation, increasing interest rates and emerging market volatility, and the resulting uncertainties, may cause currencies to fluctuate in relation to the U.S. dollar. Due to the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in other currencies over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.",

          "chunk_text": "that price increases are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\n\n## If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, or if we are unable to realize a significant portion of the anticipated benefits of our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial results could suffer.\n\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. Acquisitions of businesses, brands or bottling operations may involve significant challenges and risks, and the expected benefits, including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.\n\nWe have encountered, and may in the future encounter, challenges in successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses, brands or bottling partners in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We have faced, and may in the future face, difficulties in operating through new business models and/or supply chain models, or in new categories or territories, and challenges in extending Company controls (including internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures, data protection and cybersecurity), policies and governance structures (including with respect to food safety and quality, occupational safety and sustainability) to acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, which, at times, has resulted in increased costs and negative publicity. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage our acquisitions, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\n\nWe also participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic relationships. If we are unable to successfully manage our relationships with our joint venture partners or our strategic relationships, including our relationship with Monster, or if for any other reason we fail to realize all or a significant portion of the benefits we ex pect from our joint ventures or strategic relationships, our financial performance could be adversely affected.\n\n## If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, or experience adverse events, our business could suffer.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other ex ternal business partners, for certain services in support of key portions of our operations. These third parties are subject to similar risks as we are relating to cybersecurity, privacy violations, business interruption, and systems and employee failures, and are subject to legal, regulatory and market risks of their own. Our third-party service providers and business partners may not fulfill their respective commitments and responsibilities in a timely manner and in accordance with the agreed-upon terms or applicable laws. In addition, while we have procedures in place for assessing risk along with selecting, managing and monitoring our relationships with third-party service providers and other business partners, we do not have control over their business operations or governance and compliance systems, practices and procedures, which increases our financial, legal, cybersecurity, reputational and operational risk. If we are unable to effectively manage our third-party relationships, or for any reason our third-party service providers or business partners fail to satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities or ex perience events that could directly or indirectly impact us, our financial results could suffer.\n\n## If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, or if we or our bottling partners experience strikes, work stoppages or labor unrest, our business could suffer.\n\nMany of our employees at our key manufacturing locations and bottling plants are covered by collective bargaining agreements. While we generally have been able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms when they expire and regard our relations with employees and their representatives as generally satisfactory, negotiations may nevertheless be challenging, as the Company must have competitive cost structures in each market while meeting the compensation and benefits needs of our employees. If we are unable to renew collective bargaining agreements on satisfactory terms, our labor costs could increase, which could affect our profit margins. In addition, many of our bottling partners' employees are represented by labor unions. Strikes, work stoppages or other forms of labor unrest at any of our major manufacturing facilities or at our bottling operations or our major bottlers' plants could impair our ability to supply concentrates and syrups to our bottling partners or our bottlers' ability to supply finished beverages to customers, which could reduce our net operating revenues and could expose us to customer claims. Furthermore, from time to time we and our bottling partners restructure manufacturing and other operations to improve productivity, which may have negative impacts on employee morale and work performance, result in escalation of grievances and adversely affect the negotiation of collective bargaining agreements.

Consideration Received from Vendors\n\nWe receive consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored programs such as volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and  advertising  activities  and  for  our  compliance  programs,  referred  to  as  \"vendor  income.\"  Additionally,  under  our  compliance programs,  vendors  are  charged  for  merchandise  shipments  that  do  not  meet  our  requirements  (violations),  such  as  late  or incomplete shipments. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction of Cost of Sales.\n\nWe  establish  a  receivable  for  vendor  income  that  is  earned  but  not  yet  received.  Based  on  historical  trending  and  data,  this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Note 11 provides additional information.\n\n## 7. Advertising Costs\n\nAdvertising costs, which primarily consist of digital advertisements and media broadcast, are generally expensed at first showing or distribution of the advertisement. Reimbursements from vendors that are for specific, incremental, and identifiable advertising costs are recognized as offsets of these advertising costs within Selling, General and Administrative Expenses (SG&amp;A Expenses). Net advertising costs were $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n\n## 8. Fair Value Measurements\n\nFair value measurements are reported in one of three levels based on the lowest level of significant input used: Level 1 (unadjusted quoted prices in active markets); Level 2 (observable market inputs, other than quoted prices included in Level 1); and Level 3 (unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated by observable market data).\n\n",

          "chunk_text": "## Critical Accounting Estimates\n\nOur  consolidated  financial  statements  are  prepared  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  which  requires  us  to  make  estimates  and  apply judgments that  affect  the  reported  amounts.  In  the  Notes  to  the  Consolidated  Financial  Statements,  we  describe  the  significant accounting  policies  used  in  preparing  the  consolidated  financial  statements.  Our  management  has  discussed  the  development, selection,  and  disclosure  of  our  critical  accounting  estimates  with  the  Audit  &amp;  Risk  Committee  of  our  Board  of  Directors.  The following items require significant estimation or judgment:\n\nInventory and cost of sales: The vast majority of our inventory is accounted for under the retail inventory accounting method using the last-in, first-out method (LIFO). Our inventory is valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inventory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses verified by physical inventory counts. Historically, our actual physical inventory count results have shown our estimates to be reliable. Market adjustments for markdowns are  recorded  when  the  salability  of  the  merchandise  has  diminished.  Salability  can  be  impacted  by  consumer  preferences  and seasonality, among other factors. We believe the risk of inventory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inventory typically turns  in  less  than  three  months.  Inventory  was  $13.9  billion  and  $10.7  billion  as  of  January  29,  2022,  and  January  30,  2021, respectively, and is further described in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.\n\nVendor income: We  receive various forms of consideration from our vendors (vendor income), principally earned as a result of volume rebates, markdown allowances, promotions, and advertising allowances. Substantially all vendor income is recorded as a reduction  of  cost  of  sales.  Vendor  income  earned  can  vary  based  on  a  number  of  factors,  including  purchase  volumes,  sales volumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.\n\nWe  establish  a  receivable  for  vendor  income  that  is  earned  but  not  yet  received.  Based  on  historical  trending  and  data,  this receivable is computed by forecasting vendor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end vendor income receivables are collected within the following fiscal quarter, and we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood that the assumptions used in our estimate will change significantly. Historically, adjustments to our vendor income receivable have not been material. Vendor income receivable was $518 million and $504 million as of January 29, 2022, and January 30, 2021, respectively. Vendor income is described further in Note 6 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLong-lived assets: Long-lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed primarily at the store level. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or eventual disposition of the asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount over fair value. We estimate fair value by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining valuations from third-party brokers, or using other valuation techniques. We recorded impairments of $87  million,  $62  million,  and  $23  million  in  2021,  2020,  and  2019,  respectively,  which  are  described  further  in  Note  12  to  the Financial Statements.\n\nInsurance/self-insurance: We  retain  a  substantial  portion  of  the  risk  related  to  certain  general  liability,  workers'  compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss coverage to limit the exposure related to  certain  risks.  Liabilities  associated  with  these  losses  include  estimates  of  both  claims  filed  and  losses  incurred  but  not  yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present value; other liabilities referred to above are not discounted. Our workers' compensation and general liability accrual was $519 million and $510 million as of January 29, 2022, and  January  30,  2021,  respectively.  We  believe  that  the  amounts  accrued  are  appropriate;  however,  our  liabilities  could  be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss developments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 5 percent increase or decrease in average claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $26 million in 2021. Historically, adjustments to our estimates have not been material. Refer to Part II,  Item  7A,  Quantitative  and  Qualitative  Disclosures  About  Market  Risk,  for further disclosure of the market risks associated with these exposures. We maintain insurance coverage to limit our exposure to certain events, including network security matters.\n\n2021 Form 10-K",

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\n## Executive Overview\n\nWe continue to make strategic investments to support our durable operating and financial model that further differentiates Target and is designed to drive sustainable sales and profit growth. During 2021, in support of our enterprise strategy described in Item 1 on page 2 of this Form 10-K, we\n\n- Expanded our digital fulfillment capabilities, including adding permanent storage capacity in more than 200 high-volume stores, adding thousands of new items to the list available for Order Pickup and Drive Up, and doubling the number of Drive Up parking stalls compared with last year. During 2021, over 50 percent of our digital sales were fulfilled by our same-day fulfillment options: Order Pickup, Drive Up, and delivery via Shipt.\n- Continued the steady stream of newness across our assortment and continued to introduce new owned brands, including our arts and crafts owned brand, Mondo Llama , our sweet and savory food brand, Favorite Day , our pet food brand, Kindfull , and  our  first  dedicated  storage  and  home  organization  owned  brand,  Brightroom .  For  the  first  time  in  history,  11  brands delivered  $1  billion  or  more  in  sales,  with  4  brands  delivering  over  $2  billion  in  sales,  driven  by  strength  in  Apparel,  Home Furnishings &amp; Decor and Food &amp; Beverage. TM TM TM TM\n- Launched Ulta  Beauty  at  Target on  Target.com  and  in  about  100  Target  locations,  and  expanded  our  Apple  and  Disney experiences.\n- Remodeled 145 stores.\n- Opened 32 new stores, including 28 additional small format stores in key urban markets and on college campuses.\n- Invested significantly in our team, including recognition bonuses and launch of a new debt-free education assistance program.\n\n## Financial Summary\n\n2021 included the following notable items:\n\n- GAAP diluted earnings per share were $14.10.\n- Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $13.56.\n- Total revenue increased 13.3 percent, driven by an increase in comparable sales.\n- Comparable sales increased 12.7 percent, driven by a 12.3 percent increase in traffic.\n- Comparable store originated sales grew 11.0 percent.\n- Comparable digitally originated sales increased 20.8 percent.\n- Operating income of $8.9 billion was 36.8 percent higher than the comparable prior-year period.\n- We recognized a $335 million pretax gain on the sale of Dermstore.\n\nSales were $104.6 billion for 2021, an increase of $12.2 billion, or 13.2 percent, from the prior year. Operating cash flow provided by continuing operations was $8.6 billion for 2021, a decrease of $(1.9) billion, or (18.1) percent, from $10.5 billion for 2020.

      "answer": "Target's strategic emphasis on digital channels as a key differentiator is evident in their stated goal of delivering a seamless shopping experience across stores and digital platforms, with digital channels offering a wide and curated assortment of products. However, this strategy is accompanied by significant risks, particularly around the functionality, reliability, and speed of digital tools, which are cited as key factors that could undermine their competitive position. Additionally, while digital channels are a core part of their omnichannel fulfillment model\u2014supporting over 95% of total sales through store-based fulfillment\u2014the company acknowledges vulnerabilities such as dependence on third-party technologies and the potential for consumer decisions to be driven solely by price or digital tool performance.

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A.    Risk Factors\n\nOur business is subject to many risks. Set forth below are the material risks we face. Risks are listed in the categories where they primarily apply, but other categories may also apply.\n\n## Competitive and Reputational Risks\n\nOur  continued  success  is  dependent  on  positive  perceptions  of  Target  which,  if  eroded,  could  adversely  affect  our business and our relationships with our guests and team members.\n\nWe believe that one of the reasons our shareholders, guests, team members, and vendors choose Target is the positive reputation we have built over many years for serving those constituencies and the communities in which we operate. To be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve Target's reputation. Our reputation is based in large part on perceptions, both about us and others with whom we do business, and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence  perceptions  of  Target.  It  may  be  difficult  to  control  negative  publicity,  regardless  of  whether  it  is  accurate.  Target's responses to crises and our position or perceived lack of position on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters, such as sustainability, responsible sourcing, and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DE&amp;I), and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters,  could  harm  our  reputation.  While  reputations  may  take  decades  to  build,  negative  incidents  involving  us  or  others  with whom we do business can quickly erode trust and confidence and can result in consumer boycotts, workforce unrest or walkouts, government investigations, or litigation. For example, we have a limited ability to end our relationship with CVS, which leases space to operate their clinics and pharmacies within our stores. If our guests have negative experiences with or unfavorably view CVS or other  companies  with  whom  we  have  relationships,  it  could  cause  them  to  reduce  or  stop  their  business  with  us.  Negative reputational incidents could adversely affect our business and results of operations, including through lost sales, loss of new store and development opportunities, or team member retention and recruiting difficulties.\n\n## If  we  are  unable  to  positively  differentiate  ourselves  from  other  retailers,  our  results  of  operations  could  be  adversely affected.\n\nWe have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our guests' shopping experience through a careful combination of price,  merchandise  assortment,  store  environment,  convenience,  guest  service,  loyalty  programs,  and  marketing  efforts.  Guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores, the environmental impact of our business, the functionality, reliability, and speed of our digital channels and fulfillment options, our in-stock levels, the value and exclusivity of our offerings, and our efforts to source merchandise responsibly and ethically are among the factors that affect our ability to compete. In addition, our ability to create a personalized guest experience through the collection and use of accurate and relevant guest data is important to our ability to differentiate from other retailers. No single competitive factor is dominant, and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could adversely affect our sales, gross margins, and expenses.\n\nOur owned and exclusive brand products help differentiate us from other retailers, generally carry higher margins than equivalent national  brand  products,  and  represent  approximately  one-third  of  our  overall  sales.  If  we  are  unable  to  successfully  develop, support, and evolve our owned and exclusive brands, if one or more of these brands experiences a loss of consumer acceptance or confidence,  or  if  we  are  unable  to  successfully  protect  our  intellectual  property  rights,  our  sales  and  gross  margins  could  be adversely affected.\n\nThe retail industry's continuing migration to digital channels has affected the ways we differentiate from other retailers. In particular, consumers can quickly and conveniently comparison shop and determine real-time product availability using digital tools, which can lead  to  decisions  based  solely  on  price  or  the  functionality  of  the  digital  tools.  Consumers  may  also  use  third-party  channels  or devices, such as voice assistants and smart home devices, to initiate shopping searches and place orders, which could sometimes make us dependent on the capabilities and search algorithms of those third parties to reach those consumers. Any difficulties in executing our differentiation efforts or actions by our competitors in response to these efforts could adversely affect our sales, gross margins, and expenses.",

      "answer": "Target's balance sheet (page 41) reports 'Accrued and Other Current Liabilities' at $6,098 million for fiscal year 2022. In the lease disclosures (page 53), a subset of this amount\u2014$254 million\u2014is specifically attributed to operating leases, indicating that while accrued liabilities are a broad category, a portion is tied to lease obligations. The footnotes (page 35) direct readers to Note 14 for a detailed breakdown, suggesting that the line item includes various accruals beyond leases, such as wages, taxes, and vendor credits. This reveals that while the total accrued liabilities are substantial, they are composed of multiple components, with leases representing only a small fraction, and the remainder requiring deeper analysis through the notes.",

        "Hop 1: [TGT](page_41) \u2192 [Accrued and Other Current Liabilities]: Balance sheet reports total of $6,098 million as of January 29, 2022, indicating the overall size of the liability category.",
        "Hop 2: [TGT](page_53) \u2192 [Accrued and Other Current Liabilities]: Lease disclosures specify $254 million of this amount is related to operating leases, showing a subset of the broader category.",
        "Hop 3: [TGT](page_35) \u2192 [Accrued and Other Current Liabilities]: Financial statement index directs to Note 14 for detailed composition, implying the liabilities include diverse accruals beyond those disclosed in the lease section."

      "question": "How does Target's investment strategy in new stores align with its sales growth expectations and what does the trend in RedCard penetration suggest about the customer acquisition dynamics in these new locations?",
      "answer": "Target invested approximately $4.0\u20135.0 billion in 2022 to support new store openings, remodels, and supply chain projects, with expectations to open 25\u201330 new stores during the year. This capital allocation underscores the company\u2019s confidence in new store expansion as a driver of future sales growth, although the company also notes that comparable sales will likely represent the majority of total growth. However, despite increased RedCard sales, RedCard penetration declined as total sales grew faster, which may suggest that new store customers are not adopting the RedCard at the same rate as existing customers. This dynamic could imply that new store locations are attracting a different customer base or that the loyalty program is not as effectively penetrating new markets.",

        "Hop 1: TGT(page_22) \u2192 New Stores: Sales growth from new stores is a key driver of long-term profitability, though comparable sales are expected to lead overall growth.",

Note  4  to  the  Financial Statements defines gift card \"breakage.\" We use comparable sales to evaluate the performance of our stores and digital channel sales by measuring the change in sales for a period over the comparable, prior-year period of equivalent length. Comparable sales include all sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months, digital acquisitions we have owned less than 13 months, stores that  have  been  closed,  and  digital  acquisitions  that  we  no  longer  operate.  Comparable  sales  measures  vary  across  the  retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digitally originated sales include all sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store Order Pickup or Drive Up, and delivery via Shipt. Digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our vendors, or other third parties.\n\nSales growth - from both comparable sales and new stores - represents an important driver of our long-term profitability. We expect that comparable sales growth will drive the majority of our total sales growth. We believe that our ability to successfully differentiate our guests' shopping experience through a careful combination of merchandise assortment, price, convenience, guest experience, and  other  factors  will  over  the  long-term  drive  both  increasing  shopping  frequency  (number  of  transactions,  or  \"traffic\")  and  the amount spent each visit (average transaction amount).\n\n",

Additionally, we offer a branded proprietary Target Debit Card. Collectively, we refer to these products as RedCards\u2122.

Beyond  full-store  remodels,  we  invested  in optimizing front-end space in high-volume locations to increase the efficiency of our Same-Day Services, and built-out about 100 Ulta  Beauty  shop-in-shops.  We  have  completed  over  900  full-store  remodels  since  the  launch  of  the  current  program  in  2017, including 145 in 2021.\n\nIn  addition  to  these  cash  investments,  we  entered  into  leases  related  to  new  stores  in  2021,  2020,  and  2019  with  total  future minimum lease payments of $401 million, $764 million, and $669 million, respectively, and new leases related to our supply chain with total future minimum lease payments of $226 million, $442 million, and $185 million, respectively.\n\nWe expect capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately $4.0 billion to $5.0 billion to support remodels, new stores, and supply chain  projects.  Supply  chain  projects  will  add  replenishment  capacity  and  modernize  our  network,  including  the  use  of  sortation centers to enhance our last-mile delivery capabilities. We expect to complete approximately 200 full-store remodels, open 25 to 30 new stores, and add more than 250 Ulta Beauty shop-in-shops during 2022. Additionally, we will continue to invest in optimizing front-end space. We also expect to continue to invest in new store and supply chain leases.\n\n## Dividends\n\nWe paid dividends totaling $1.5 billion ($3.16 per share) in 2021 and $1.3 billion ($2.68 per share) in 2020, a per share increase of 17.9 percent. We declared dividends totaling $1.7 billion ($3.38 per share) in 2021 and $1.4 billion ($2.70 per share) in 2020, a per share increase of 25.2 percent. We have paid dividends every quarter since our 1967 initial public offering and it is our intent to continue to do so in the future.\n\n## Share Repurchases\n\nDuring 2021 and 2020 we returned $7.2 billion and $609 million, respectively, to shareholders through share repurchase. See Part II, Item 5, Market for the Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and Note 21 to the Financial Statements for more information.\n\nTARGET CORPORATION\n\n2021 Form 10-K\n\n28",

      "question": "How does Walmart's gross profit rate performance and its underlying drivers differ across the Walmart U.S., Walmart International, and Sam's Club segments in fiscal 2024 and 2023, and what does this reveal about the relative strength and challenges of each segment?",
      "answer": "In fiscal 2024, Walmart U.S. contributed positively to the gross profit rate increase of 27 basis points, driven by competitive pricing and lapping higher markdowns, despite product mix shifts into lower-margin categories. Walmart International saw a smaller increase of 20 basis points due to supply chain efficiencies, partially offset by format and channel shifts. In contrast, Sam's Club experienced a gross profit rate decline of 155 basis points in fiscal 2023, primarily due to inventory markdowns, elevated supply chain and eCommerce fulfillment costs, and inflation-related LIFO charges, though it improved in fiscal 2024 with a 55 basis point increase due to lapping markdowns, despite product mix headwinds.

      "answer": "Currency exchange rate fluctuations unfavorably impact Walmart International's reported profitability by increasing costs when products are purchased in non-local currencies (page 24). This segment uses either the retail inventory method (RIM) or the weighted-average cost method with FIFO valuation, depending on store format and market (page 60), which affects how inventory costs flow through to the income statement. Additionally, a portion of the cost of Walmart International's distribution facilities is included in operating, selling, general and administrative expenses rather than cost of sales, which influences gross profit and gross profit margin comparisons with other retailers (page 64). Together, these factors shape how currency risks ultimately affect the segment's financial performance as reported.",

      "question": "Given Walmart's cybersecurity risks related to eCommerce operations, the reported growth in Sam's Club eCommerce sales over the past three fiscal years, and the inclusion of eCommerce sales in Walmart's comparable sales metric, how does the company's exposure to digital threats align with its strategic emphasis on eCommerce growth and its reported performance metrics?",
      "answer": "Walmart faces significant cybersecurity risks that could disrupt its eCommerce operations, as outlined in the risk factors on page 20, including threats to digital platforms, customer data breaches, and potential loss of sales. Despite these risks, Sam's Club reported consistent growth in eCommerce sales\u2014$9.9 billion in fiscal 2024, $8.4 billion in fiscal 2023, and $6.9 billion in fiscal 2022\u2014indicating a strong strategic push into digital commerce. Furthermore, as disclosed on page 36, eCommerce sales are fully integrated into Walmart's comparable sales metric, which management uses to assess performance. This suggests that while Walmart is increasingly dependent on its digital platforms for revenue growth, it also faces rising exposure to cyber threats that could undermine both its financial performance and customer trust if not effectively managed.",

      "question": "How does Walmart's growth in Membership and Other Income, which increased 7.5% in fiscal 2024, align with its total revenue composition and gross profit trends, considering both historical performance and operational drivers?",
      "answer": "Walmart's Membership and Other Income grew by 7.5% in fiscal 2024, reaching $5,488 million, driven by membership base expansion and Plus penetration. This growth contributes to total revenues, which reached $648.125 billion in fiscal 2024. The increase in Membership and Other Income aligns with an improvement in gross profit rate by 55 basis points in fiscal 2024, attributed in part to the expiration of a promotional offering that had offset membership fee increases in the prior year. This suggests that membership growth not only bolsters top-line revenue but also supports margin expansion through more stable and recurring income streams.",

      "question": "How did Costco's capital expenditures for new warehouses in fiscal year 2024 compare to its total dividend payments during the same period, and what does this suggest about its capital allocation priorities?",
      "answer": "In fiscal year 2024, Costco spent $4,710 on capital expenditures, primarily for opening 30 new warehouses, including one relocation. During the same period, the company paid $8,589 in total dividends, which included a special dividend of $15 per share. This suggests that despite continued investment in warehouse expansion, Costco prioritized returning significant capital to shareholders through both special and increased regular dividends.",

      "question": "How does Costco's discussion of membership fee revenue growth in the context of operational risks, recent fee increases, and overall financial performance paint a comprehensive picture of its reliance on this revenue stream?",
      "answer": "Costco's membership fee revenue is a critical component of its financial model, with growth in this area driven by new sign-ups, Executive membership upgrades, and a recent fee increase in the U.S. and Canada, which is expected to generate an additional $370 million in revenue over two years. Despite this positive momentum, the company faces operational risks\u2014such as supply chain disruptions, brand perception issues, and IT system failures\u2014that could undermine member satisfaction and renewal rates, which currently stand at 92.9% in the U.S. and Canada. Financially, membership fee revenue increased 5% to $4.828 billion in 2024, aligning with the broader trend of revenue growth and contributing to a 17% increase in net income. This synthesis reveals that while Costco is successfully leveraging membership pricing and penetration to boost revenue, its ability to sustain this growth remains contingent on maintaining high renewal rates and mitigating risks that could erode member loyalty.",

      "question": "How does Costco's treatment of merchandise inventories in deferred tax liabilities compare with the changes in inventories reflected in operating cash flows and the geographic composition of inventory assets, and what does this reveal about the company's inventory management and tax positioning?",
      "answer": "Costco reported merchandise inventories at $18,647 million in 2024, with a geographic breakdown showing the majority in the United States. In the deferred tax liabilities section, inventories contributed a tax deferral of $296 million in 2024, down from $380 million in 2023. Meanwhile, the cash flow statement showed a significant outflow of $2,068 million in 2024 related to changes in inventories, indicating increased inventory investment during the year. This combination suggests that while inventory levels rose substantially\u2014especially in the U.S.\u2014the tax impact of inventory accounting methods on deferred liabilities decreased, possibly reflecting changes in valuation or tax treatment strategies.",

      "question": "How does Costco's special dividend of $15 per share impact both its tax position and capital allocation strategy, considering the discrete tax benefits tied to the dividend, its effect on cash distributions, and the remaining stock repurchase capacity?",
      "answer": "Costco's special dividend of $15 per share in 2024 had a direct favorable impact on its tax position through a discrete tax benefit of $94 million related to the portion of the dividend paid through the 401(k) plan. This benefit was a key component of the 2024 effective tax rate. On the capital allocation front, the special dividend represented a significant cash outflow of approximately $6,655 million, which dramatically increased total cash dividends from $1,703 million in 2023 to $8,589 million in 2024. Despite this large dividend payment, Costco still had $2,865 million remaining under its $4,000 million stock repurchase authorization as of the end of 2024, indicating continued flexibility in its capital return strategy even after the special dividend.",

      "answer": "PepsiCo's Juice Transaction gain of $3,321 million is excluded from non-GAAP financial measures as an item affecting comparability, reflecting its non-recurring nature. This gain had a significant impact on operating profit, contributing favorably to Europe's profit improvement despite prior-year charges related to the transaction. Regionally, Europe experienced a beverage unit volume decline of 3%, with Germany and France showing double-digit and high-single-digit declines respectively, indicating that the Juice Transaction gain was not driven by volume performance but rather by one-time gains, which contrasts with the ongoing challenges in the beverage segment.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PEP](page_47) \u2192 [Juice Transaction Gain]: Europe's operating profit improvement notes the unfavorable impact of the prior-year gain associated with the Juice Transaction, indicating its materiality in year-over-year comparisons.",
        "Hop 2: [PEP](page_111) \u2192 [Juice Transaction Gain]: The Juice Transaction gain is quantified at $3,321 million and is shown to reduce net income by $2,888 million after tax, with a per-share impact of $2.08, underscoring its significance in financial reporting.",
        "Hop 3: [PEP](page_49) \u2192 [Juice Transaction Gain]: The gain is explicitly excluded from non-GAAP financial measures as an item affecting comparability, suggesting it is not reflective of ongoing operational performance."

      "question": "How does the consistent decline in convenient foods unit volume across multiple geographic segments reconcile with the varying impacts on operating profit and strategic pricing actions in different regions?",
      "answer": "The convenient foods unit volume declined across APAC (2%), LatAm (4%), and Europe (slight decrease), reflecting regional challenges such as double-digit declines in Thailand, Colombia, and Spain, respectively. Despite these volume declines, operating profit was positively impacted in APAC by lower impairment charges and productivity savings, while Europe saw improvement due to prior-year charges related to the Russia-Ukraine conflict and lower SodaStream impairments. In contrast, LatAm experienced a 38% operating profit increase, driven by favorable foreign exchange and productivity savings, despite the volume decline. These trends suggest that while unit volume is under pressure globally, strategic pricing and cost management have mitigated the impact on profitability in certain regions.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PEP](page_48) \u2192 [Convenient Foods Unit Volume]: APAC experienced a 2% decline in convenient foods unit volume, primarily due to a double-digit decline in Thailand and a low-single-digit decline in Australia, partially offset by growth in China.",
        "Hop 2: [PEP](page_46) \u2192 [Convenient Foods Unit Volume]: In LatAm, convenient foods unit volume declined by 4%, driven by a double-digit drop in Colombia and low-single-digit declines in Mexico and Brazil.",
        "Hop 3: [PEP](page_47) \u2192 [Convenient Foods Unit Volume]: In Europe, convenient foods unit volume slightly decreased overall, with a high-single-digit decline in the UK, double-digit decline in Spain, and mid-single-digit decline in France, partially offset by growth in Russia and Turkey."

      "question": "How do PepsiCo's acquisition and divestiture-related charges, including integration costs and employee-related expenses, factor into the broader context of their 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan's $1.9 billion in incurred pre-tax charges through 2023, and how are these charges reflected in the corporate unallocated expenses?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo's acquisition and divestiture-related charges, which include integration costs such as employee-related expenses, contract termination fees, and contingent consideration gains, are a component of the broader 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan. Through December 30, 2023, the company has incurred $1.9 billion in pre-tax charges under this plan, which was extended through 2028 to further streamline operations and optimize the supply chain. These charges, including those related to acquisitions and divestitures, are partially classified under corporate unallocated expenses, which also include centrally managed initiatives like business transformation efforts. This indicates that the company's restructuring and transformation activities, including those tied to mergers and divestitures, are being centrally managed and funded through operational cash flows, aligning with the long-term strategic realignment of the business.",

      "answer": "The AMESA segment shows varying levels of financial impact across the three perspectives. In 2023, AMESA contributed $2 million to acquisition and divestiture-related charges (down from $3 million in 2022 and $10 million in 2021), indicating a reduced level of M&A activity or integration costs. In 2022, AMESA incurred $5 million in pandemic-related charges, consistent with its 2021 level of $7 million, suggesting ongoing operational challenges during the pandemic. Cumulatively through 2023, AMESA received $97 million in transformation investments, reflecting PepsiCo\u2019s strategic focus on modernization and growth in that region. Together, these figures indicate that while AMESA has seen less M&A disruption recently, it has been a consistent area of pandemic impact and a target for long-term strategic investment.",

      "answer": "PBNA's acquisition and divestiture-related charges dropped significantly from $51 million in 2022 to $16 million in 2023, suggesting reduced restructuring activity. Meanwhile, its transformation initiative costs also declined from $23 million in 2022 to $0 in 2023, indicating fewer operational changes during this period. Despite this decline, PBNA's cumulative investment commitments increased steadily, reaching $267 million by the end of 2023, which implies continued strategic investment even as restructuring and transformation activities slowed. This suggests a shift from active reorganization to more stable, long-term investment in the business.",

          "chunk_text": "As a result of such translations, fluctuations in currency ex change rates from period-to-period that are unfavorable to us may also result in our Consolidated Financial Statements reflecting significant adverse period-over-period changes in our financial performance or reflecting a period-over-period improvement in our financial performance that is not as robust as it would be without such fluctuations in the currency exchange rates. Such unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations will adversely affect the reported performance of our Walmart International operating segment and have a corresponding adverse effect on our reported consolidated results of operations.\n\nWe may pay for products we purchase for sale in our stores, clubs and eCommerce platforms around the world with a currency other than the local currency of the country in which the goods will be sold. When we must acquire the currency to pay for such products and the exchange rates for the payment currency fluctuate in a manner unfavorable to us, our cost of sales may increase and we may be unable or unwilling to change the prices at which we sell those goods to address that increase in our costs, with a corresponding adverse effect on our gross profit. Consequently, unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates have adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our results of operations.\n\n## Legal, Tax, Regulatory, Compliance, Reputational and Other Risks\n\nOur international operations subject us to legislative, judicial, accounting, legal, regulatory, tax, political and economic risks and conditions specific to the countries or regions in which we operate, which could materially adversely affect our business or financial performance.\n\nIn addition to our U.S. operations, we operate retail and eCommerce businesses in Africa, Canada, Central America, Chile, China, India and Mexico.\n\nDuring fiscal 2025, our Walmart International operations generated approximately 18% of our consolidated net sales. Walmart International's operations in various countries also source goods and services from other countries. Our future operating results in these countries could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, most of which are beyond our control. These factors include political conditions, including political instability, local and global economic conditions; legal and regulatory constraints, such as regulation of product and service offerings including regulatory restrictions (such as foreign ownership restrictions) on eCommerce and retail operations in international markets, such as in India; restrictive governmental actions, such as trade protection measures or nationalization; antitrust and competition law regulatory matters, such as those underway in Canada, Mexico and India (relating to our Flipkart subsidiary); local product safety and environmental laws; tax regulations; local labor laws; anti-money laundering laws and regulations; trade policies; foreign ex change or currency regulations; laws and regulations regarding consumer and data protection; and other matters in any of the countries or regions in which we operate, now or in the future.\n\nChanging our operations in accordance with new or changed restrictions on international trade or newly imposed sanctions can be expensive, time-consuming and disruptive to our operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. In addition, tensions between nation-state governments and conflicts of laws may lead to challenges for our operations. If disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response, or consumer boycotts in certain regions, could be significantly more severe and restrictive and could adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could also adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation. The economies of some of the countries in which we have operations have in the past suffered from high rates of inflation and currency devaluations, which, if they recur, could adversely affect our financial performance. Other factors which may impact our international operations include foreign trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the U.S. and other countries, laws, regulations and other activities of foreign governments, agencies and similar organizations, and risks associated with having numerous facilities located in countries that have historically been less stable than the U.S. Additional risks inherent in our international operations generally include, among others, the costs and difficulties of managing international operations, adverse tax consequences and greater difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights in countries other than the U.S. The various risks inherent in doing business in the U.S. generally also ex ist when doing business outside of the U.S., and may be exaggerated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, geopolitical tensions or events, laws and regulations.\n\nIn foreign countries in which we have operations, a risk exists that our associates, contractors or agents could, in contravention of our policies, engage in business practices prohibited by U.S. laws and regulations applicable to us, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or U.S. sanctions laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries. Our global policies designed to regulate such business practices and our global compliance programs designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations may not be adequate to prevent the risk that one or more of our associates, contractors or agents, including those based in or from countries where practices that violate such U.S. laws and regulations or the laws and regulations of other countries may be customary, will engage in business practices that are appropriately regulated by our policies, circumvent our compliance programs and, by doing so, violate such laws and regulations. Any such violations, even if prohibited by our internal policies, could subject us to fines and penalties and adversely affect our business or financial performance and our reputation.",

Net receivables from transactions with customers were $4.4 billion and $3.7 billion as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, respectively.\n\n## Inventories\n\nThe Company utilizes various inventory methods to account for and value its inventories depending upon the nature of the store formats and businesses in each of its segments, resulting in inventories that are recorded at the lower of cost or market or net realizable value, as appropriate.\n\n- Walmart U.S. Segment - Inventories are primarily accounted for under the retail inventory method of accounting (\"RIM\") to determine inventory cost, using the last-in, first-out (\"LIFO\") valuation method. RIM generally results in inventory being valued at the lower of cost or market as permanent markdowns are immediately recorded as a reduction of the retail value of inventory.\n- Walmart International Segment - Depending on the store format in each market, inventories are generally accounted for using either the RIM or weightedaverage cost method, using the first-in, first-out valuation method.\n- Sam's Club U.S. Segment - The majority of this segment's inventory is accounted for and valued using the weighted-average cost LIFO method.\n\nFor those segments that utilize the LIFO method, the Company records an adjustment each quarter, if necessary, for the projected annual effect of inflation or deflation. These estimates are adjusted to actual results determined at year end for inflation or deflation and inventory levels.\n\n## Property and Equipment\n\nProperty and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Gains or losses on disposition are recognized as earned or incurred. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. The following table summarizes the Company's property and equipment balances and includes the estimated useful lives that are generally used to depreciate the assets on a straight-line basis:\n\n",

      "answer": "Walmart's unit count grew steadily in its consolidated operations (from 10,623 to 10,771 units), reflecting a consistent global expansion strategy. Domestically, unit counts declined slightly (from 4,717 to 4,605), indicating a contraction or optimization of the U.S. footprint. Internationally, unit counts increased (from 5,306 to 5,566), showing a focused push in global markets. These trends align with differing financial performance metrics: international operations saw operating income growth (from $2.965B to $5.501B), while domestic operations showed strong comparable sales growth (4.8%\u20135.5%) despite fewer locations. Consolidated net sales grew consistently (from $605.881B to $674.538B), supported by international expansion and domestic efficiency.",

      "answer": "The South Korea indirect tax charge of $204 million resulted in a $0.11 per share decrease in diluted EPS and was recorded in the EA, AU & PMI DF segment. This charge, along with other one-time items like the $140 million termination of the Foundation for a Smoke-Free World pledge and $109 million in asset impairment and exit costs, contributed to a 5.6% decrease in operating income. While the charge was fully included in the EA, AU & PMI DF segment results, it compounded the impact of other charges across multiple segments, significantly affecting overall financial performance.",

        "Hop 1: [PM](page_33) \u2192 [South Korea Indirect Tax Charge]: The adverse Supreme Court ruling in South Korea led to a $204 million pre-tax charge ($174 million net of tax or $0.11 per share decrease in diluted EPS) recorded in Q2 2023.",

      "answer": "In 2022, PM recorded a $151 million pre-tax charge related to the war in Ukraine, which was included in the Europe segment and translated to a $0.08 diluted EPS charge. In 2023, this charge decreased to $53 million pre-tax, or $0.03 per diluted EPS, also within the Europe segment. These charges were primarily driven by humanitarian efforts, inventory write-downs, and asset impairments. The reduction in charges from $151 million to $53 million indicates a moderation in Ukraine-related costs year-over-year, consistent with both the segment-level reporting in the operational results and the consolidated EPS impact disclosed in the financial highlights.",

However, on an international level, PM's cigarette market share remained relatively stable at 23.7% in 2023 compared to 23.6% in 2022, with only a slight 0.1 percentage point increase. Looking at historical data, Europe's cigarette market share had declined even more significantly from 32.2% in 2021 to 31.1% in 2022, a drop of 1.1 percentage points. This pattern indicates a consistent erosion of PM's dominance in the European cigarette market, while its global market share has remained relatively flat, suggesting that the company may be maintaining its position in other international markets to offset regional declines.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of Interest and Other Debt Expense, Net across the income statement, EBITDA reconciliation, and historical financial data reflect its impact on MO's profitability and leverage profile in 2024?",
      "answer": "Interest and Other Debt Expense, Net totaled $1,037 million in 2024 according to the income statement, directly reducing operating income and contributing to a lower net earnings figure of $11,264 million. This expense is also reflected in the EBITDA reconciliation, where it is added back to net earnings to arrive at EBITDA of $14,981 million, highlighting its non-operational nature. When viewed alongside the historical data showing a relatively stable trend in this expense over the past three years, it becomes evident that MO's debt servicing burden has remained consistent despite strategic shifts like the IQOS System divestiture, which supports a leverage ratio of 2.2x net earnings and 2.1x EBITDA.",

Despite ongoing litigation exposure, Altria has not recorded any provisions for potential losses from pending litigation, as management concludes that unfavorable outcomes are not probable or estimable (page 30).

We use certain factors to make this determination including (i) the duration and magnitude of the fair value decline, (ii) the financial condition and near-term prospects of the investee and (iii) our intent and ability to hold our investment until recovery to its carrying value.\n\nSee Note 8. Investments in Equity Securities for additional information on our accounting policy for our former investment in JUUL.\n\n- Litigation Contingencies and Costs: We record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We expense litigation defense costs as incurred and include these costs in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. See Note 20. Contingencies .\n- Marketing Costs: Our businesses promote their products with consumer incentives, trade promotions and consumer engagement programs. These consumer incentive and trade promotion activities, which include discounts, coupons, rebates, in-store display incentives and volume-based incentives, do not create a distinct deliverable and are, therefore, recorded as a reduction of revenues. We make consumer engagement program payments to third parties. Our businesses expense these consumer engagement programs, which include event marketing, as incurred, and such expenses are included in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings. For interim reporting purposes, our businesses charge consumer engagement programs and certain consumer incentive expenses to operations as a percentage of sales, based on estimated sales and related expenses for the full year.\n- Revenue Recognition: Our businesses generate substantially all of their revenue from sales contracts with customers. While our businesses enter into separate sales contracts with each customer for each product type, all sales contracts are similarly structured. These contracts create an obligation to transfer product to the customer. Our businesses satisfy all performance obligations within one year; therefore, we expense costs to obtain contracts as incurred and do not disclose unsatisfied performance obligations. There is no financing component because our businesses expect, at contract inception, that the period between when our businesses transfer product to the customer and when the customer pays for that product will be one year or less.\n\nOur businesses define net revenues as revenues, which include excise taxes and shipping and handling charges billed to customers, net of cash discounts for prompt payment, sales returns (also referred to as returned goods) and sales incentives. Our businesses exclude from the transaction price sales taxes and value-added taxes imposed at the time of sale.\n\nOur businesses recognize revenues from sales contracts with customers upon shipment of goods when control of such products is obtained by the customer. Our businesses determine that a customer obtains control of the product upon shipment when title of such product and risk of loss transfers to the customer. Our businesses account for shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs and such amounts are classified as part of cost of sales in our consolidated statements of earnings. Our businesses record an allowance for returned goods, based principally on historical volume and return rates, which is included in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. Our businesses record sales incentives, which consist of consumer incentives and trade promotion activities, as a reduction to revenues (a portion of which is based on amounts estimated as being due to wholesalers, retailers and consumers at the end of a period) based principally on historical volume, utilization and redemption rates. We include expected payments for sales incentives in accrued marketing liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\nPayment terms vary depending on product type. Our businesses consider payments received in advance of product shipment as deferred revenue, which we include in other accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets until revenue is recognized. PM USA primarily receives payments in advance of a customer obtaining control of the product. USSTC, Helix and NJOY receive substantially all payments within one business day of a customer obtaining control of the product. We include amounts due from customers in receivables on our consolidated balance sheets.\n\n- Supplier Financing: We facilitate a voluntary supplier financing program under which participating suppliers may elect to sell receivables due from us to a third-party financial institution. Our payments are made on the terms originally negotiated with the supplier, and we have no economic interest in a supplier's sale of a receivable. All outstanding balances under the supplier financing program are recorded in accounts payable on our consolidated balance sheets.",

PM USA's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements to make quarterly payments with respect to settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees ended in the fourth quarter of 2024. In addition, PM USA, Middleton and USSTC are subject to quarterly user fees imposed by the FDA as a result of the FSPTCA. Payments under the State Settlement Agreements and the FDA user fees are based on variable factors, such as volume, operating income, market share and inflation, depending on the subject payment. Our subsidiaries account for the cost of the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees as a component of cost of sales. Our subsidiaries recorded approximately $3.7 billion and $4.0 billion of charges to cost of sales for the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023, respectively, in connection with the State Settlement Agreements and FDA user fees.\n\nWe record provisions in our consolidated financial statements for pending litigation when we determine that an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. At the present time, while it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable outcome in a case may occur, except to the extent discussed in Note 20 and Item 3: (i) management has concluded that it is not probable that a loss has been incurred in any pending litigation; (ii) management is unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome in any pending case; and (iii) accordingly, management has not provided any amounts in our consolidated financial statements for unfavorable outcomes, if any. We expense litigation defense costs as incurred and include such costs in marketing, administration and research costs in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\n- Employee Benefit Plans: We provide a range of benefits to certain employees and retired employees, including pension, postretirement health care and postemployment benefits. We record annual amounts relating to these plans based on calculations specified by GAAP, which include various actuarial assumptions as to discount rates, assumed rates of return on plan assets, mortality, compensation increases, turnover rates and health care cost trend rates. We review our actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends when it is deemed appropriate to do so. Any effect of the modifications is generally amortized over future periods.\n\nWe recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans on the consolidated balance sheets and record as a component of other comprehensive earnings (losses), net of deferred income taxes, the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit cost (income). We subsequently amortize the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits recorded as components of other comprehensive earnings (losses) into net periodic benefit cost (income) in future years.\n\nDue to changes in market factors, our discount rates used to determine our pension plan and postretirement plan obligations increased to 5.7% at December 31, 2024 from 5.3% and 5.2%, respectively, for these plans at December 31, 2023. We presently anticipate net pre-tax pension and postretirement income of approximately $15 million in 2025 versus net pre-tax  income of $46 million in 2024. This decrease is due primarily to lower ex pected income on plan assets and higher amortization of net unrecognized losses in 2025, partially offset by lower service and interest costs. Assuming no change to the shape of the yield curve, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in our discount rates would increase (decrease) our pension and postretirement expense by approximately $10 million. Similarly, a 50 basis point decrease (increase) in the ex pected return on plan assets would increase (decrease) our pension and postretirement expense by approximately $40 million.\n\nFor additional information see Note 18. Benefit Plans to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 18').\n\n- Income Taxes: Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax  bases of assets and liabilities, using enacted tax  rates in effect for the year in which the differences are ex pected to reverse. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax  asset will not be realized. We determine the realizability of deferred tax  assets based on the weight of all available positive and negative evidence. In reaching this determination, we consider the character of the assets and the possible sources of taxable income of the appropriate character within the available carryback and carryforward periods available under the tax law.\n\nWe recognize the financial statement benefit for uncertain income tax positions in our consolidated financial statements when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon ex amination by tax ing authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. For those income tax positions where it is more likely than not that a tax  benefit will not be sustained, no tax benefit is recognized in the financial statements. We recognize accrued interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions as part of the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of earnings.\n\nWe recognized income tax benefits and charges in the consolidated statements of earnings during 2024 and 2023 as a result of various tax events.\n\nFor additional information on income taxes, see Note 16. Income Taxes to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 16').",

      "answer": "The $354 million Skoal trademark impairment (page 87) directly reflects the impact of declining MST category share and the rise of nicotine pouches (page 34), which together reduced the fair value of the Skoal trademark. The impairment was triggered by a decrease in the size of the MST category, partially driven by nicotine pouch volumes growing to 45.7% of the U.S. oral tobacco category in Q4 2024 (page 34). This market shift is also acknowledged in the risk factors section (page 12), which explicitly states that the Skoal trademark impairment resulted from the decrease in MST category size due to nicotine pouch growth. The company\u2019s valuation assumptions for the trademark are sensitive to actual revenue performance and long-term outlook, meaning that further declines in MST share or slower-than-expected recovery could lead to additional impairments (page 12). Therefore, the impairment amount and its segment-specific recognition reflect both the immediate financial impact and the underlying market dynamics affecting the Skoal brand\u2019s valuation.",

These existing and potential future laws and regulations could increase the costs of, and impair our ability to, source certain materials used in the packaging for our products.\n\nIf we are unable to compensate for supply shortages or elevated commodity and other costs through sustained price increases, cost efficiencies, such as in manufacturing and distribution, or otherwise manage the exposure through sourcing strategies, the limited use of commodity hedging contracts or through other initiatives, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\n\nOur operating companies rely on a few significant facilities and a small number of key suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers, and an extended disruption at a facility or in serv ice by a supplier, distributor or distribution chain serv ice prov ider could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\nOur operating companies face risks inherent in reliance on a few significant manufacturing facilities and a small number of key suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers. A natural or man-made disaster, cybersecurity incident, global pandemic, labor disruption or other disruption that affects the manufacturing operations of any of our operating companies, the operations of any key supplier, distributor or distribution chain service provider of any of our operating companies or any other disruption in the supply or distribution of goods or services (including a key supplier's inability to comply with government regulations, lack of available workers or unwillingness to supply goods or services to a tobacco company) could adversely impact operations. Operations of our operating companies, suppliers, distributors and distribution chain service providers could be suspended temporarily once or multiple times, or halted permanently, depending on various factors. An extended disruption in operations experienced by one or more of our operating companies or in the supply or distribution of goods or services by one or more key suppliers, distributors or distribution chain service providers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## We may be required to write down goodwill and intangible assets, including trademarks and intellectual property, due to impairment, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n\nWe periodically calculate the fair value of our reporting units and intangible assets to test for impairment. This calculation may be affected by several factors, including general macroeconomic conditions, the proliferation of illicit products, government actions, including FDA regulatory actions and inaction, changes in category growth (decline) rates as a result of changing adult tobacco consumer preferences, success of planned new product expansions, competitive activity, unfavorable outcomes with respect to litigation proceedings, including actions brought against us alleging patent infringement, and income and excise taxes. Certain events also can trigger an immediate review of intangible assets.\n\nFor example, we recorded an impairment on the value of the Skoal trademark in the second quarter of 2024. The impairment was the result of the decrease in the fair value of the Skoal trademark caused by decreases in the size of the MST products category, which were due, in part, to the growth of nicotine pouch volumes. We continue to monitor several factors that impact the fair value of the Skoa l trademark. For ex ample, if Skoal's actual revenue and income or long-term outlook are significantly different from forecasted performance used to estimate the fair value or if the discount rate used to estimate the fair value increases, we could have an additional non-cash impairment on the carrying value of the Skoal trademark in future periods.\n\nWe monitor several factors that could impact the carrying value of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill and related definite-lived intangible assets. Increasing sales of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products and the lack of meaningful enforcement against these products have negatively impacted the volume growth of NJOY's pod-based e-vapor products. Additionally, in January 2025, in a patent lawsuit adjudicated before the ITC, the ITC imposed bans on the importation of NJOY ACE into the United States and the sale and marketing of NJOY ACE products previously imported into the United States. If the bans on the importation into the United States and the sale and marketing of NJOY ACE become effective or continued illicit e-vapor product sales or other factors result in a significantly unfavorable longterm outlook for NJOY's volume growth rates versus our projections used to estimate the fair value, either development could result in a non-cash impairment of our e-vapor reporting unit's goodwill or related definite-lived intangible assets, or both, in future periods.\n\nIf any impairment is determined to exist, we will incur impairment charges, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial position.\n\nOur Optimize &amp; Accelerate initiativ e may expose us to increased risks relating to business continuity and our internal control over financial reporting and audit procedures, among others, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial position or results of operations.\n\nIn October 2024, we announced the multi-phase Initiative, through which we plan to increase our organization's speed, efficiency and effectiveness by centralizing work, outsourcing certain transactional tasks and streamlining, automating and standardizing processes.\n\nThe Initiative presents a number of risks that could adversely impact our business, such as risks relating to operational continuity, talent management and internal control over financial reporting and audit procedures. For example, we may experience a loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge and inefficiency during transitional periods. Furthermore, many of the tasks that will be outsourced will be performed in developing countries that may be at a heightened risk for geopolitical uncertainty, which could result in service",

We believe that a significant number of adult tobacco consumers switch among tobacco categories, use multiple forms of tobacco products and try innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches. As innovative smoke-free products evolve to better address the preferences of adult tobacco consumers, these consumers continue to transition from cigarettes and MST products to exclusive use of innovative smoke-free tobacco product alternatives, which aligns with our Vision. As a result, long-term trends in the overall nicotine space are improving. Industry equivalized nicotine volumes increased for the second consecutive year in 2024 and grew by a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 2% over the past five years.\n\nWe work to meet these evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences over time by developing, manufacturing, marketing and distributing products both within and outside the United States through innovation and other growth strategies (including, where appropriate, arrangements with, or investments in, third parties and acquisitions).\n\nWe estimate that, when adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, total estimated domestic cigarette industry volume declined by 8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 9% for the full year. PM USA reported domestic cigarette volumes declined by 8.8% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and 10.2% for the full year. When adjusted for calendar differences and trade inventory movements, PM USA volumes for the fourth quarter of 2024 and the full year each declined by an estimated 11%. In the fourth quarter, Marlboro share of the total cigarette category was 41.3%, a decrease of 1.0 share point versus the prior year and 0.3 share points in the fourth quarter. Marlboro share performance is discussed further in the Operating Results - Smokeable Products Segment below.\n\nWe have been monitoring shifts in adult tobacco consumer preferences and their effects on cigarette industry decline rates. As a result, we believe that the decline in adult smokers, excluding any cross category movement, resulted in an estimated 2.5% decline in cigarette industry volume over the 12 months ended December 31, 2024. We estimate that cross-category movement contributed to cigarette industry volume declines in a range of approximately 3% to 4% over the 12 months ended December 31, 2024.\n\nFor the 12 months ended December 31, 2024, we estimate the e-vapor category grew approximately 30% versus the prior 12-month period, driven by the growth of illicit flavored disposable e-vapor products. We estimate that illicit products now represent more than 60% of the e-vapor category. These illicit disposable e-vapor products are largely distributed through non-traditional retail channels (including e-commerce and vape retail channels), making them more difficult to track. In addition, we believe illicit cigarettes are becoming more prevalent in the United States, based on the results of discarded pack studies we conducted in select geographies. We believe the FDA's inadequate enforcement and slow pace of smoke-free product authorizations enables bad actors to disregard regulation and illicit products to proliferate. Through our competitive intelligence tracking, we continue to monitor these growing trends and evaluate the impacts on the overall nicotine and tobacco categories.\n\nFor the fourth quarter of 2024, reported shipment volume of NJOY consumables (including NJOY ACE and NJOY DAILY ) was approximately 12.8 million units, and NJOY device shipment volume was approximately 1.1 million units. The NJOY share of the pod-based e-vapor category reached 6.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024, an increase of 0.2 share points sequentially and 2.8 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nThe U.S. nicotine pouch category continued to grow significantly throughout the fourth quarter of 2024 to 45.7% of the U.S. oral tobacco category, an increase of 9.6 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023. on! maintained year-over-year share momentum through the fourth quarter of 2024 to achieve 8.9% of the total oral tobacco category, an increase of 2.0 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023 and unchanged sequentially.\n\nFor the fourth quarter 2024, the traditional smokeless category (including MST) share of the total oral tobacco category declined to 54.3%, down 9.6 share points versus the fourth quarter of 2023. Copenhagen had an oral tobacco category share of 18.1% for the fourth quarter of 2024, a decrease of 3.6 share points when compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. We continue to track the growth of nicotine pouch volumes and the related impact on the size of the MST category. Decreases in the size of the MST category could impact the carrying value of our assets, such as our smokeless tobacco product goodwill and trademarks. For example, in the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a non-cash, pre-tax impairment on the value of the Skoal trademark.\n\nThroughout the full year 2024, U.S. adult tobacco consumers remained under pressure largely due to the compounding effects of high prices exceeding overall wage growth. In addition, consumer credit and credit card delinquency rates rose to the highest levels since 2011 in the first half of 2024. While recent reports indicate that consumer credit and delinquency rates are beginning to moderate, these rates remain at historically high levels. Although the monthly rate of inflation stabilized during the year, headwinds continued for U.S. adult tobacco consumers. Gas prices throughout the fourth quarter of 2024 experienced seasonal declines, averaging $3.02 per gallon for the month of December 2024. While gas prices were lower than in the prior year, they remained consistently above $3.00 per gallon throughout 2024.",

      "answer": "Altria's obligations under the State Settlement Agreements, which required approximately $3.5 billion in payments during 2024, combined with $84 million in estimated annual postretirement health care costs and a $4 million Broin lawsuit settlement paid in Q3 2024, place significant pressure on its cash flow. Despite these commitments, Altria maintained a strong capital return program, paying $6.8 billion in dividends and repurchasing $2.4 billion of stock under ASR transactions. This suggests that Altria prioritizes shareholder returns even amid substantial legal and settlement liabilities, likely supported by its $8.8 billion in operating cash flow. However, the company notes uncertainty around the timing of other long-term liabilities, indicating potential future cash flow constraints that could affect these capital allocation decisions.",

In addition, we had accrued pension obligations, substantially all of which are funded from plan assets. For further information on our postretirement health care and pension obligations, see Note 18.\n\nIn October 2024, we entered into an agreement with the IRS regarding the tax treatment of a $6.4 billion ordinary loss we recognized in 2023 for cash tax purposes with respect to a portion of our tax  basis associated with our former investment in JUUL. As a result, other liabilities decreased approx imately $1.1 billion, which included the reversal of an unrecognized tax benefit associated with the $6.4 billion ordinary loss position recognized in 2023, as further discussed in Note 16.\n\nWe are unable to estimate the timing of payments of other long-term liabilities included on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2024.\n\n## Equity and Dividends\n\nDuring 2024, we paid dividends of $6.8 billion, essentially unchanged from 2023, reflecting a higher dividend rate, mostly offset by fewer shares outstanding as a result of shares we repurchased under our share repurchase programs.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2024, our Board approved a 4.1% increase in the quarterly dividend rate to $1.02 per share of our common stock versus the previous rate of $0.98 per share. Our current annualized dividend rate is $4.08 per share. Our 2028 Goals include a progressive dividend goal targeting mid-single digits dividend per share growth annually through 2028. Future dividend payments remain subject to the discretion of our Board.\n\nIn March 2024, we increased our $1.0 billion share repurchase program to $3.4 billion and entered into ASR transactions for our common stock. In the first half of 2024, we paid $2.4 billion for the repurchase of our common stock in the ASR transactions. We funded the ASR transactions with proceeds from the ABI Transaction.\n\nFor further discussion of our share repurchase programs, see Note 12 and Part II, Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities of this Form 10-K.\n\n## Financial Review\n\n## Cash Provided by/Used in Operating Activities\n\nDuring 2024, net cash provided by operating activities was $8.8 billion compared with $9.3 billion during 2023. This decrease was due primarily to lower net revenues, payments for certain transferable income tax credits, higher litigation payments and a portion of the NJOY contingent payments ($140 million), partially offset by lower payments for (i) federal ex cise tax es and (ii) Statement Settlement Agreements, due primarily to lower smokeable products shipment volume.\n\nWe had a working capital deficit at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and believe we have the ability to fund working capital deficits with cash provided by operating activities, borrowings under our Credit Agreement and access to the credit and capital markets.\n\n## Cash Provided by/Used in Investing Activities\n\nDuring 2024, net cash provided by investing activities was $2.2 billion compared with net cash used in investing activities of $1.3 billion during 2023. This change was due primarily to proceeds from the ABI Transaction in 2024 and the payments for the NJOY Transaction in 2023, partially offset by proceeds from the sale of IQOS System commercialization rights in 2023.\n\nCapital expenditures for 2024 decreased 27.6% to $142 million. We expect capital expenditures for 2025 to be in the range of $175 million to $225 million, which are expected to be funded from operating cash flows.\n\n## Cash Provided by/Used in Financing Activities\n\nDuring 2024, net cash used in financing activities was $11.5 billion compared with $8.4 billion during 2023. This increase was due primarily to higher share repurchases in 2024, issuance of long-term debt in 2023 and a portion of the NJOY contingent payments ($110 million), partially offset by lower repayments of long-term debt in 2024.\n\n## New Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n\nSee Note 2 for a discussion of issued accounting guidance applicable to, but not yet adopted by, us.\n\n## Contingencies\n\nSee Note 20 and Item 3 for a discussion of contingencies.\n\n## Supplemental Guarantor Financial Information\n\nPM USA ('Guarantor'), which is a 100% owned subsidiary of Altria Group, Inc.

Investigations or enforcement actions could result in significant costs or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\n\n## Excise Taxes\n\nTobacco products are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. Significant increases in tobacco-related taxes or fees have been proposed or enacted (including with respect to e-vapor products) and are likely to continue to be proposed or enacted at the federal, state and local levels within the United States. The frequency and magnitude of excise tax increases can be influenced by various factors, including the composition of executive and legislative bodies.\n\nFederal, state and local cigarette ex cise tax es have increased substantially over the past two decades, far outpacing the rate of inflation. Between the end of 1998 and February 24, 2025, the weighted-average state cigarette excise tax increased from $0.36 to $1.93 per pack. Three states (Maryland, Colorado and Rhode Island) increased excise taxes in 2024. As of February 24, 2025, no states have increased excise taxes in 2025. However, various increases are under consideration or have been proposed.\n\nA majority of states currently tax  MST using an ad valorem method, which is calculated as a percentage of the price of the product, typically the wholesale price. This ad valorem method results in more tax being paid on premium products than is paid on lower-priced products of equal weight. We support legislation to convert ad valorem taxes on MST to a weight-based methodology because, unlike the ad valorem tax, a weight-based tax subjects cans of equal weight to the same tax. As of February 24, 2025, the federal government, 23 states, Puerto Rico, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Cook County, Illinois have adopted a weight-based tax methodology for MST. North Carolina has passed legislation that will cause the state to adopt a weight-based tax methodology for MST in July 2025.\n\nAn increasing number of states and localities also are imposing excise taxes on e-vapor products and oral nicotine pouches. As of February 24, 2025, 33 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and a number of cities and counties have enacted legislation to tax e-vapor products. These taxes are calculated in varying ways and may differ based on the e-vapor product form. Similarly, 13 states and the District of Columbia have enacted legislation to tax oral nicotine pouches.\n\nTax increases are expected to continue to have an adverse impact on sales of our operating companies' products through lower consumption levels and the potential shift in adult tobacco consumer purchases from premium to non-premium or discount cigarettes, to lower taxed tobacco products or to counterfeit and contraband products. Lower sales volume and reported share performance of our operating companies' products could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In addition, substantial ex cise tax  increases on e-vapor and oral nicotine products may negatively impact adult smokers' transition to these products, which could materially adversely affect our innovative tobacco businesses and our ability to achieve our Vision.\n\n## International Treaty on Tobacco Control\n\nThe World Health Organization's Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (the 'FCTC') entered into force in February 2005. As of February 24, 2025, 182 countries, as well as the European Union, have become parties to the FCTC. While the United States is a signatory of the FCTC, it is not currently a party to the agreement, as the agreement has not been submitted to, or ratified by, the U.S. Senate. The FCTC is the first international public health treaty and its objective is to establish a global agenda for tobacco regulation with the purpose of reducing initiation of tobacco use and encouraging cessation. The treaty recommends (and in certain instances, requires) signatory nations to enact legislation that would address various tobacco-related issues.\n\nThere are a number of proposals currently under consideration by the governing body of the FCTC, some of which call for substantial restrictions on the manufacture, marketing, distribution and sale of tobacco products. It is not possible to predict the outcome of these proposals or the impact of any FCTC actions on legislation or regulation in the United States, either indirectly or as a result of the United States becoming a party to the FCTC, or whether or how these actions might indirectly influence FDA regulation and enforcement.\n\n## State Settlement Agreements\n\nAs discussed in Note 20, during 1997 and 1998, PM USA and other major domestic cigarette manufacturers entered into the State Settlement Agreements. These settlements require participating manufacturers to make substantial annual payments, which are adjusted for several factors, including inflation, operating income, market share and industry volume. Increases in inflation can increase our financial liability under the State Settlement Agreements. The State Settlement Agreements' inflation calculations require us to apply the higher of 3% or the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers ('CPI-U') percentage rate as published in January of each year. As of December 2024, the inflation calculation was approximately 2.9% based on the latest CPI-U data. We will continue to monitor the impact of increased inflation on the macroeconomic environment and our businesses.",

Accordingly, in the second quarter of 2024, we recorded a pre-tax provision of $4 million related to the settlement of these cases, which we paid in the third quarter of 2024.\n\n## Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation\n\nOverview: In the health care cost recovery litigation, governmental entities seek reimbursement of health care cost expenditures allegedly caused by tobacco products and, in some cases, of future expenditures and damages. Relief sought by some but not all plaintiffs includes punitive damages, multiple damages and other statutory damages and penalties, injunctions prohibiting alleged marketing and sales to minors, disclosure of research, disgorgement of profits, funding of anti-smoking programs, additional disclosure of nicotine yields, and payment of attorney and expert witness fees.\n\nAlthough there have been some decisions to the contrary, most judicial decisions in the United States have dismissed all or most health care cost recovery claims against cigarette manufacturers. Nine federal circuit courts of appeals and eight state appellate courts, relying primarily on grounds that plaintiffs' claims were too remote, have ordered or affirmed dismissals of health care cost recovery actions. The U.S. Supreme Court has refused to consider plaintiffs' appeals from the cases decided by five federal circuit courts of appeal.\n\nIn addition to the cases brought in the United States, health care cost recovery actions have been brought against tobacco industry participants, including PM USA and Altria, in Canada (10 cases), and other entities have stated that they are considering filing such actions.\n\nSince the beginning of 2008, the Canadian Provinces of British Columbia, New Brunswick, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia have brought health care reimbursement claims against cigarette manufacturers. PM USA is named as a defendant in the British Columbia and Quebec cases, while both Altria and PM USA are named as defendants in the New Brunswick, Ontario, Newfoundland and Labrador, Alberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Prince Edward Island and Nova Scotia cases. The Nunavut Territory and Northwest Territory have passed legislation permitting similar claims, but lawsuits based on this legislation have not been filed. All of these cases have been stayed pending resolution of proceedings in Canada involving three tobacco manufacturers (none of which are affiliated with us) under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act discussed above. See Smoking and Health Litigation - Other Smoking and Health Class Actions above for a discussion of these proceedings. See Guarantees and Other Similar Matters below for a discussion of the Distribution Agreement between Altria and PMI that provides for indemnities for certain liabilities concerning tobacco products.\n\nSettlements of Health Care Cost Recovery Litigation: In November 1998, PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers entered into the Master Settlement Agreement (the 'MSA') with 46 states, the District of Columbia and certain United States territories to settle asserted and unasserted health care cost recovery and other claims. PM USA and certain other tobacco product manufacturers had previously entered into agreements to settle similar claims brought by Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota (together with the MSA, the 'State Settlement Agreements'). The State Settlement Agreements require that the original participating manufacturers or 'OPMs' (now PM USA, R.J. Reynolds and, with respect to certain brands, ITG Brands, LLC ('ITG')) make annual payments of approximately $10.4 billion, subject to adjustments for several factors, including inflation, market share and industry volume. The OPMs' obligation to make quarterly payments settling plaintiffs' attorneys' fees, subject to an annual cap of $500 million, on a pro rata basis based on market share, ended in the fourth quarter of 2024. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, the aggregate amount recorded in cost of sales with respect to the State Settlement Agreements was approximately $3.5 billion, $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. These amounts include PM USA's estimate of amounts related to NPM Adjustments discussed below.\n\nNon-Participating Manufacturer ('NPM') Adjustment Disputes: The 'NPM Adjustment' is a reduction in MSA payments made by the OPMs and those manufacturers that are subsequent signatories to the MSA (collectively, the 'participating manufacturers' or 'PMs') that applies if the PMs collectively lose at least a specified level of market share to non-participating manufacturers since 1997, subject to certain conditions and defenses. The applicability of this reduction has been subject to certain disputes, some of which have been resolved via settlement, as discussed below.\n\n## Settlements of NPM Adjustment Disputes.\n\n- Multi-State Settlement . As of January 2022, a total of 36 states and territories had settled NPM Adjustment disputes relating to varying periods of time. In March 2022, August 2023 and February 2024, Illinois, Iowa and Idaho, respectively, joined the multi-state settlement, bringing the total number of states and territories that have joined the multi-state settlement to 39. In the first quarter of 2022, PM USA recorded $80 million, $20 million of which related to the 2019 through 2021 'transition years,' as a reduction in cost of sales as a result of Illinois joining the multi-state settlement. As a result of Iowa joining the multi-state settlement, PM USA will receive approximately $19 million for 2005 through 2022, $4 million of which relates to the 2020 through 2022 'transition years.' Accordingly, PM USA recorded $19 million as a reduction in cost of sales in the third quarter of 2023. As a result of Idaho joining the multi-state settlement, PM USA will receive approximately $8 million for 2005 through 2023, $2 million of which relates to the 2021 through 2023 'transition years.' In connection with this development, PM USA recorded $8 million as a reduction in cost of sales in the first quarter of 2024. Pursuant to the multi-state settlement, PM USA has received",

      "answer": "In 2024, PEP reported a $187 million product recall-related impact in its cash flow statement, compared to $136 million in 2023, indicating an increasing trend in recall costs. On a regional basis in 2024, the Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) segment was most affected, with a 14% negative impact on reported GAAP results due to recalls. Despite these impacts, the company maintained a core non-GAAP operating profit growth of 6%, showing that recall costs were managed without significantly eroding underlying profitability. The 2024 cash flow statement also shows a $148 million cash payment specifically tied to product recall-related impacts, suggesting that the company is actively spending to resolve these issues, not just recognizing them on the income statement.",

      "question": "How does PepsiCo's treatment of the AMESA segment reflect its strategic and financial positioning when considering capital allocation, restructuring charges, and asset impairment activity across different sections of the 10-K?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo's AMESA segment shows minimal capital allocation with only $14 million allocated in 2024, indicating limited strategic investment compared to other segments. The segment also incurred $5 million in acquisition and divestiture-related charges in 2024, suggesting ongoing restructuring efforts. Additionally, AMESA reported no impairment charges in 2024, a decline from $6 million in 2023 and $31 million in 2022, which indicates a reduction in asset write-downs but also potentially fewer underperforming assets requiring impairment. Together, these figures suggest that AMESA is not a major focus of investment or restructuring in 2024, with a possible stabilization of its asset base.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [PEP](page_82) \u2192 [AMESA]: In the capital allocation table, AMESA received only $14 million in 2024, significantly less than other segments like Europe ($123M) or FLNA ($150M), indicating limited strategic investment.",
        "Hop 2: [PEP](page_113) \u2192 [AMESA]: AMESA incurred $5 million in acquisition and divestiture-related charges in 2024, showing ongoing restructuring activity, though lower than in prior years.",
        "Hop 3: [PEP](page_75) \u2192 [AMESA]: AMESA had no impairment charges in 2024, down from $6 million in 2023 and $31 million in 2022, suggesting fewer underperforming assets or completed write-downs."

This aligns with the $9 million impairment charge recorded for the segment related to a nutrition bar brand, indicating asset devaluation.

      "question": "How did the impact of the 'Loss Related to Interest Rate Swaps' on Mondel\u0113z's diluted EPS evolve across reporting periods, and what does this reveal about its fluctuating influence on adjusted EPS and overall earnings performance?",
      "answer": "The 'Loss Related to Interest Rate Swaps' had a diminishing impact on diluted EPS over the periods analyzed. In 2020, it contributed a positive adjustment of $0.05 to EPS, as seen in the reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted EPS. By 2021, this item no longer had a positive effect and instead dropped to $0.00, indicating the loss had either been resolved or was no longer applicable. This fluctuation reveals that while the interest rate swaps had a minor negative effect on earnings in 2020, they did not persist into 2021, suggesting a strategic or financial restructuring around debt or hedging instruments during this time.",

        "Hop 1: [MDLZ](page_76) \u2192 [Loss Related to Interest Rate Swaps]: In 2020, the loss contributed a $0.05 adjustment to diluted EPS, indicating a minor negative impact on earnings.",
        "Hop 2: [MDLZ](page_75) \u2192 [Loss Related to Interest Rate Swaps]: By 2021, the adjustment from this item was $0.00, showing the loss was no longer affecting EPS, either due to resolution or restructuring.",
        "Hop 3: [MDLZ](page_51) \u2192 [Loss Related to Interest Rate Swaps]: The reconciliation of GAAP EPS to adjusted EPS for 2020 confirms the $0.05 adjustment, and the absence in 2021 is consistent with the full-year adjusted EPS growth from $2.56 to $2.87."

      "answer": "MDLZ's World Travel Retail segment faced significant challenges throughout the 2020\u20132022 period due to the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, the segment was 'negatively impacted by COVID-19,' particularly during the second quarter when international travel restrictions and store closures in duty-free locations severely curtailed sales (page_53). By 2021, the segment showed signs of recovery with 'double-digit revenue growth,' especially in the latter part of the year, although revenues had not yet returned to pre-pandemic levels (page_36). As of 2022, the company continued to flag the segment as vulnerable in its Risk Factors section, noting that 'some of these parts of our business continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing pandemic' and that recovery timelines remained uncertain (page_19). This trajectory illustrates a gradual but incomplete rebound, with persistent risks extending into 2022.",

          "chunk_text": "\n(1) Please see the Non-GAAP Financial Measures section at the end of this item.\n\nNet revenue increase of 2.8% was driven by our underlying Organic Net Revenue growth of 3.7% and the impact of acquisitions, mostly offset by unfavorable currency and the impact of a prior-year divestiture. Net revenues were higher in developed markets, particularly North America, where due to the COVID-19 outbreak and response, demand for our products, primarily biscuits and chocolate, grew significantly as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption. However, our gum and candy categories as well as our world travel retail and foodservice businesses were negatively impacted by COVID-19. In emerging markets, where we have a greater concentration of traditional trade, several markets were challenged by COVID-19 impacts, particularly those with significant gum and candy portfolios. Overall, as the negative impacts of COVID-19 experienced in the first half of the year subsided in the second half of the year, revenue growth began to recover in a number of our key emerging markets, though overall emerging markets net revenues declined due to unfavorable currency impacts.\n\nOrganic Net Revenue growth was driven by higher net pricing and favorable volume/mix. Higher net pricing in all regions except Europe was due to the benefit of carryover pricing from 2019 as well as the effects of input cost-driven pricing actions taken during 2020. Favorable volume/mix in North America and Europe, partially offset by unfavorable volume/mix in Latin America and AMEA, included strong volume gains tempered by unfavorable mix reflecting shifts in consumer purchases in response to the COVID-19 outbreak. The April 1, 2020 acquisition of Give &amp; Go added incremental net revenues of $390 million and the July 16, 2019 acquisition of a majority interest in Perfect Snacks added incremental net revenues of $55 million in 2020. Unfavorable currency impacts decreased net revenues by $637 million, due primarily to the strength of the U.S. dollar relative to most currencies, including the Brazilian real, Argentinean peso, Russian ruble, Mexican peso, Indian rupee, South African rand and Turkish lira, partially offset by the strength of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, including the euro, Philippine peso, British pound sterling, Egyptian pound and Swedish krona. The impact of the May 28, 2019 divestiture of most of our cheese business in the Middle East and Africa resulted in a year-over-year decline in net revenues of $55 million.

We believe the successful implementation of our strategic priorities and leveraging of our strong foundation of iconic global and local brands, an attractive global footprint, our market leadership in developed and emerging markets, our deep innovation, marketing and distribution capabilities, and our efficiency and sustainability efforts, will drive top- and bottom-line growth, enabling us to continue to create long-term value for our shareholders.\n\nFor more detailed information on our business and strategy, refer to Item 1, Business.\n\n## Recent Developments and Significant Items Affecting Comparability\n\n## COVID-19\n\nAs the COVID-19 global pandemic continues and new variants of the virus emerge, such as Omicron in late 2021, our main priorities continue to be the safety of our employees and helping maintain the global food supply. Together with our employees, customers, suppliers and other partners, we are working to emerge from the pandemic stronger.\n\nDuring 2020, the first year of the pandemic, we experienced a significant increase in demand and revenue growth in certain markets as consumers increased their food purchases for in-home consumption. Results were particularly strong in modern trade (such as large grocery supermarkets and retail chains), digital commerce and especially for categories such as biscuits. However, other parts of our business were negatively affected by mandated lockdowns and other related restrictions. This was especially so during the second quarter of 2020 for some of our emerging markets due to store closures, particularly in our Latin America region as well as parts of our AMEA region that have a greater concentration of traditional trade (such as small family-run stores), our world travel retail (such as international duty-free stores), and our foodservice businesses as well as categories like gum and candy, which are more traditionally purchased and consumed out of home. The negative impacts experienced in the second quarter of 2020 began to subside in the second half of 2020, as demand grew in both developed and emerging markets and a number of our key markets returned to higher growth; however, our gum and candy, world travel retail and foodservice businesses as well as parts of our traditional trade business in parts of emerging markets continued to be negatively affected by the ongoing pandemic.\n\nDuring 2021, we continued to see increased demand for most of our snack category products in both our emerging and developed markets relative to 2020; however, revenue from parts of our business were not yet back to pre-pandemic levels. In 2021, net revenue growth was 8.0% and Organic Net Revenue growth was 5.2%. In 2021, while we experienced double-digit revenue growth in gum as well as significant growth in other areas such as foodservice and world travel retail, revenues in these businesses were not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. Our overall outlook for future snacks revenue growth remains strong, but as the pandemic continues, we anticipate increased volatility in revenues until COVID-related risks and the international supply chain issues and labor and transportation constraints subside and snacks consumption stabilizes to a more normal growth level.\n\nWe continue to track new developments and ongoing impacts from the pandemic. Most disruptions we experienced in our operations due to the pandemic have been temporary and not material to our consolidated results. In the second half of 2021, we experienced higher operating costs, including higher overall raw material, transportation, labor and fuel costs, that we anticipate will continue into 2022. We discuss these and other ongoing impacts of COVID-19 below.",

Our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the 'Exchange Act'), are available free of charge as soon as possible after we electronically file them with, or furnish them to, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the 'SEC'). You can access our filings with the SEC by visiting www.sec.gov or our website: ir.mondelezinternational.com/sec-filings. The information on our web site is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.\n\n## Item 1A. Risk Factors.\n\nYou should carefully read the following discussion of significant factors, events and uncertainties when evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, these risk factors do not identify all the risks we face, and there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be significant that may have a material adverse effect on our business, performance or financial condition in the future.\n\n## Strategic and Operational Risks\n\nGlobal or regional health pandemics or epidemics, including COVID-19, could negatively impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\n\nOur business and financial results could be negatively impacted by COVID-19 or other pandemics or epidemics. The severity, magnitude and duration of the current COVID-19 pandemic remain uncertain and hard to predict. Since 2020, COVID-19 has significantly impacted economic activity and markets around the world, and it could negatively impact our business in numerous ways, including but not limited to those outlined below:\n\n- In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lower revenues in some of our emerging market countries that have a greater concentration of traditional trade outlets (such as small family-run stores), as well as in our world travel retail (such as international duty-free stores) and foodservice businesses and categories like gum and candy, which are more traditionally purchased and consumed out of home. Some of these parts of our business continue to be negatively affected by the ongoing pandemic, and some of these areas such as gum that grew in 2021 have not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. We are unable to predict how long these trends will continue or whether they will worsen.\n- In 2020 and 2021, sales of some of our products in some markets and channels increased, such as products for in-home consumption and categories like biscuits, as well as the modern trade and digital commerce channels. We are unable to predict how long this sustained demand will last. Different markets and parts of our business will recover from the COVID-19 pandemic at different rates depending on many factors including vaccination levels or new COVID-19 variants and related outbreaks within a market.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted and could materially disrupt our global supply chain, operations and routes to market or those of our suppliers, their suppliers, our external manufacturing partners, distributors or other business partners. Disruptions or our failure to effectively respond to them have increased and could in the future increase product or distribution costs or cause delays in delivering or an inability to deliver products to our customers. For example, we experienced temporary disruptions in operations in some of our emerging markets such as India and Nigeria in the first half of 2020 and Vietnam in 2021.\n- The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in broader supply, transportation and labor disruptions resulting in inflation and generally higher operating costs in our business. In 2021, we experienced labor disruptions primarily in our North America region, which impacted our sales in the fourth quarter. We also experienced labor-related disruptions in our network of third-party logistics and external manufacturing, and we anticipate labor shortage-related issues will continue in 2022. As a result of incremental pandemic-related expenditures and labor disruptions, we incurred and expect to continue to incur higher labor costs, particularly as the pandemic continues.",

      "question": "How does Mondel\u0113z's treatment of the net gain on divestiture in 2019 differ across its EPS reconciliation, operating income adjustments, and historical operating income breakdown, and what does this reveal about the financial impact of divestitures on different performance metrics?",
      "answer": "In 2019, the net gain on divestiture is reported as a negative adjustment of $0.03 per share in the EPS reconciliation (page_76), indicating a reduction in diluted EPS. In the operating income adjustments (page_74), the net gain on divestiture is listed as a $44 million reduction to operating income. Similarly, in the historical operating income breakdown (page_54), the net gain on divestiture is shown as a $44 million negative adjustment. This consistent negative impact across both income statement metrics and per-share calculations suggests that divestitures had a material adverse effect on reported profitability in 2019, despite potentially aligning with strategic simplification goals.",

      "answer": "The total financial impact of CEO transition remuneration on diluted EPS was $0.01 in 2019 and $0.00 in 2020, resulting in a cumulative impact of $0.01. This aligns with the company's rationale for excluding these costs from non-GAAP results, as they were described as one-time, non-recurring expenses related to incentivizing the new CEO's transition and ensuring continuity during leadership change, rather than part of ongoing executive compensation.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n- (3)    Constant currency operating results are calculated by dividing or multiplying, as appropriate, the current-period local currency operating results by the currency exchange rates used to translate the financial statements in the comparable prior-year period to determine what the current-period U.S. dollar operating results would have been if the currency exchange rate had not changed from the comparable prior-year period.\n\n(4)    Non-GAAP adjustments related to the Simplify to Grow Program reflect costs incurred that relate to the objectives of our program to transform our supply chain network and organizational structure. Costs that do not meet the program objectives are not reflected in the non-GAAP adjustments.\n\n(5)    During the third quarter of 2018, as we began to apply highly inflationary accounting for Argentina (refer to Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies ), we excluded the remeasurement gains or losses related to remeasuring net monetary assets or liabilities in Argentina during the period to be consistent with our prior accounting for these remeasurement gains/losses for Venezuela when it was subject to highly inflationary accounting prior to deconsolidation in 2015.\n\n(6)    We exclude unrealized gains and losses (mark-to-market impacts) from outstanding commodity and forecasted currency and equity method investment transaction derivative from our non-GAAP earnings measures. The mark-to-market impacts of commodity and forecasted currency transaction derivatives are excluded until such time that the related exposures impact our operating results. Since we purchase commodity and forecasted currency transaction contracts to mitigate price volatility primarily for inventory requirements in future periods, we make this adjustment to remove the volatility of these future inventory purchases on current operating results to facilitate comparisons of our underlying operating performance across periods. We exclude equity method investment transaction derivative contract settlements as they represent protection of value for future divestitures.\n\n(7)    See Note 14, Commitments and Contingencies - Tax Matters , for additional information.\n\n(8)    On November 20, 2017, Dirk Van de Put succeeded Irene Rosenfeld as CEO of Mondel\u0113z International in advance of her retirement at the end of March 2018. In order to incent Mr. Van de Put to join us, we provided him compensation with a total combined target value of $42.5 million to make him whole for incentive awards he forfeited or grants that were not made to him when he left his former employer. The compensation we granted took the form of cash, deferred stock units, performance share units and stock options. In connection with Irene Rosenfeld's retirement, we made her outstanding grants of performance share units for the 2016-2018 and 2017-2019 performance cycles eligible for continued vesting and approved a $0.5 million salary for her service as Chairman from January through March 2018. We refer to these elements of Mr. Van de Put's and Ms. Rosenfeld's compensation arrangements together as 'CEO transition remuneration.' We are excluding amounts we expense as CEO transition remuneration from our nonGAAP results because those amounts are not part of our regular compensation program and are incremental to amounts we would have incurred as ongoing CEO compensation. As a result, in 2017, we excluded amounts expensed for the cash payment to Mr. Van de Put and partial vesting of his equity grants. In 2018, we excluded amounts paid for Ms. Rosenfeld's service as Chairman and partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put's and Ms. Rosenfeld's equity grants. In 2019, we excluded amounts related to the partial vesting of Mr. Van de Put's equity grants. During the first quarter of 2020, Mr. Van de Put's equity grants became fully vested.\n\n(9)    The impact from pension participation changes represents the charges incurred when employee groups are withdrawn from multiemployer pension plans and other changes in employee group pension plan participation. We exclude these charges from our non-GAAP results because those amounts do not reflect our ongoing pension obligations. See Note 11, Benefit Plans , for more information on the multiemployer pension plan withdrawal.\n\n(10)    We have excluded the initial impacts from enacted tax law changes. Initial impacts include items such as the remeasurement of deferred tax balances and the transition tax from the 2017 U.S. tax reform. Previously, we only excluded the initial impacts from more material tax reforms, specifically the impacts of the 2019 Swiss tax reform and 2017 U.S. tax reform. We exclude initial impacts from enacted tax law changes from our Adjusted EPS as they do not reflect our ongoing tax obligations under the enacted tax law changes. Refer to Note 16, Income Taxes , for more information on the impact of Swiss and U.S. tax reform.\n\n(11)    We have excluded our proportionate share of our equity method investees' significant operating and non-operating items such as acquisition and divestiture related costs, restructuring program costs and initial impacts from enacted tax law changes, in order to provide investors with a comparable view of our performance across periods. Although we have shareholder rights and board representation commensurate with our ownership interests in our equity method investees and review the underlying operating results and significant operating and non-operating items each reporting period, we do not have direct control over their operations or resulting revenue and expenses. Our use of equity method investment net earnings on an adjusted basis is not intended to imply that we have any such control. Our GAAP 'diluted EPS attributable to Mondel\u0113z International from continuing operations' includes all of the investees' significant operating and non-operating items.\n\nWe believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with our U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures, provides you with a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business than could be obtained absent these disclosures. Because non-GAAP financial measures vary among companies, the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this report may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. Our use of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for any U.S. GAAP financial measures. A limitation of these non-GAAP financial measures is they exclude items detailed below that have an impact on our U.S. GAAP reported results. The best way this limitation can be addressed is by evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures in combination with our U.S. GAAP reported results and carefully evaluating the following tables that reconcile U.S. GAAP reported figures to the non-GAAP financial measures in this Form 10-K.",

      "answer": "In 2020, the remeasurement of the net monetary position contributed $0.01 to diluted EPS and added $9 million to operating income. This dual impact suggests that while the item had a minor effect on earnings per share, it represented a modest positive adjustment to operational performance. However, given its small magnitude relative to total earnings and operating income, the remeasurement likely had limited strategic significance to MDLZ's overall financial results for the year.",

      "question": "What was the impact of unfavorable currency translation on MDLZ's 2023 organic revenue growth and adjusted operating income compared to 2022, and how does this affect the evaluation of the company's core business performance?",
      "answer": "Unfavorable currency translation reduced MDLZ's 2023 net revenue growth by partially offsetting the 14.7% underlying Organic Net Revenue growth, as noted on page 39. On page 45, the impact of unfavorable currency translation was quantified at $312 million in 2022, while in 2023, this figure dropped to $190 million, as shown on page 40. This decline in the negative currency impact suggests an improvement in the company's foreign exchange environment or hedging effectiveness. When adjusting for currency, MDLZ's constant currency Adjusted Operating Income increased from $5,197 million in 2022 to $5,824 million in 2023 (pages 45 and 40), indicating that core business drivers like pricing and cost management were strong despite external currency headwinds. This context implies that MDLZ's underlying performance was more robust than reported GAAP figures suggest, with currency effects obscuring the true operational momentum.",

      "question": "What was the total financial impact of inventory step-up charges on MDLZ's operating income margin in 2022, and how does this align with their adjusted earnings performance and tax treatment of the same item?",
      "answer": "The inventory step-up charges incurred by MDLZ in 2022 amounted to $7 million and contributed to the year-over-year decrease in operating income margin from 16.2% in 2021 to 11.2% in 2022. These charges were also excluded from Adjusted Operating Income, which decreased marginally from 16.5% to 15.8%, indicating that the charges had a material impact on GAAP operating income but were adjusted in non-GAAP performance metrics. Additionally, the tax benefit associated with these charges was $7 million, further confirming that they were treated as a non-recurring item in the company's earnings adjustments.",

      "question": "How does the treatment of 'Interest and Other Expense, Net' in MDLZ's income statement reconcile with its exclusion from segment operating income and its reclassification of losses within this line item?",
      "answer": "MDLZ reports 'Interest and Other Expense, Net' as $310 million in 2023, which includes reclassified losses recorded within this line item, such as those related to benefit plans and hedging activities. However, this expense is excluded from segment operating income, as the company centrally manages these financial items and does not allocate them to regional segments for performance evaluation. This creates a distinction between the consolidated income statement, where the full $310 million expense impacts net earnings, and the segment reporting, where such costs are treated as corporate-level items outside of regional profitability analysis.",

      "answer": "Mondel\u0113z excludes Benefit Plan Non-Service Income from segment operating results to provide better transparency into core operational performance, as stated in the segment reporting section (page 119). This exclusion means analysts must separately consider the impact of this income\u2014declining from $163 million in 2021 to $82 million in 2023 (page 67)\u2014when evaluating underlying profitability trends. Despite this decline, the company's earnings before income taxes rose to $5,880 million in 2023 from $4,369 million in 2021 (page 49), suggesting that core operations compensated for the reduction in non-service income, which could indicate stronger operational efficiency or growth in higher-margin product lines.",

      "answer": "In 2022, Colgate-Palmolive recorded goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges that contributed 4.0% to the GAAP operating profit margin decline, reducing the GAAP operating profit margin to 16.1% from 20.5% in 2023. These charges also impacted net income, contributing to a lower GAAP net income of $1,785 million ($2.13 per share) compared to $2,300 million ($2.77 per share) in 2023. The company excludes these charges in non-GAAP measures because they are considered non-recurring and not reflective of the company\u2019s ongoing operational performance, aligning with management\u2019s view that such exclusions provide a clearer picture of the company's underlying business trends and facilitate better period-to-period comparisons.",

      "answer": "The $47 million gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific in 2022 directly impacts the interpretation of Colgate-Palmolive\u2019s operating profit and net income by inflating the unadjusted 2022 figures, which makes the year-over-year growth appear stronger in unadjusted terms but more modest when adjusted. On page_36, operating profit in 2022 included this gain, and when excluded, operating profit still increased by 10% from $3,681 million to $4,036 million in 2023. Similarly, on page_39, net income in 2022 also included the gain, and after adjusting for this and other items, the increase in net income was a more modest 8% from $2,493 million to $2,682 million. The gain, as shown on page_122, was a one-time item that contributed to the net other (income) expense figure for 2022. Therefore, while the gain boosted reported results, the underlying profitability growth appears more moderate when this and other non-recurring items are excluded.",

From an investment standpoint, the segment saw $301 million in capital expenditures in 2023, indicating continued investment in infrastructure and growth (page_117). Operationally, Pet Nutrition accounted for 22% of Colgate's total worldwide net sales in 2023, highlighting its importance as a core business segment (page_3). Financially, the segment's operating profit was $806 million in 2023, showing resilience despite a slight decline from $850 million in 2022. Additionally, the segment had $488 million in goodwill as of the end of 2022, reflecting past acquisitions and the company's strategic emphasis on this business area (page_88).

      "answer": "Hill's Pet Nutrition's contribution to Colgate's operating profit increased significantly in 2023, rising to 23% compared to 11% in 2022, indicating stronger financial performance and growing importance within the company\u2019s portfolio. This aligns with Colgate\u2019s strategic decision to acquire three dry pet food manufacturing plants in the U.S. for $719 million, further supporting Hill\u2019s global growth ambitions. The acquisition, combined with Hill\u2019s outperformance relative to other regional and functional segments like Latin America (0% in 2023) and Corporate (18% in 2023), suggests that Colgate is prioritizing expansion and investment in the pet nutrition segment to capitalize on market opportunities and drive long-term growth.",

      "answer": "In 2024, MDLZ incurred ERP Systems Implementation costs that negatively impacted operating income in both the Latin America and Asia Pacific segments. In Latin America, these costs were listed alongside other productivity and integration expenses that partially offset gains from higher net pricing and lower remeasurement losses. Similarly, in Asia Pacific, ERP implementation costs were among the factors that offset otherwise favorable operating performance driven by pricing and productivity. These costs were also disclosed in the non-GAAP financial adjustments section, where ERP Systems Implementation costs of $19 million were specifically called out as a pre-tax item excluded from Adjusted EPS calculations. This demonstrates that ERP implementation had both direct operational impacts on segment performance and required specific financial disclosure adjustments.",

However, at the EPS level, currency-related items added $0.13 to adjusted EPS, suggesting a more favorable impact on earnings, possibly due to hedging or translation effects.

Currency-related items were unfav orable, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, due to currency translation rate changes. Unfav orable currency translation impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to most currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, Brazilian real, Mexican peso and Chilean peso, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, primarily the Colombian peso. Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix reflected v olume declines due to consumer softness, primarily in Mexico and Argentina, partially offset by fav orable product mix. Ov erall, unfav orable v olume/mix was driv en by declines in chocolate, candy, cheese &amp; grocery and refreshment bev erages, partially offset by gains in biscuits &amp; baked snacks and gum. Higher net pricing, net of the adjustment for extreme pricing in Argentina, was driv en by input cost-driv en pricing actions and reflected across all categories, primarily in Argentina, Mexico and Brazil.\n\nSegment operating income increased $3 million (0.6%), primarily due to higher net pricing, lower remeasurement loss on net monetary position, lower manufacturing  costs  driv en  by  productiv ity,  lower  acquisition  integration  costs  and  lower  other  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses.  T hese fav orable  items  were  mostly  offset  by  higher  raw  material  costs,  unfav orable  currency-related  items,  unfav orable  v olume/mix,  higher  adv ertising  and consumer promotion costs, higher costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow Program, costs incurred for the ERP Systems Implementation program and intangible asset impairment charges incurred in 2024.\n\n## 2023 compared with 2022\n\nNet rev enues increased $1,377 million (37.9%), due to higher net pricing (31.0 pp), the impact of acquisitions (14.0 pp) and fav orable v olume/mix (3.8 pp), partially offset by unfav orable currency (10.0 pp) and the impact of div estitures (0.9 pp). Higher net pricing was reflected across all categories, driv en primarily  by Argentina  as  well  as  Brazil  and  Mexico.  T he  Nov ember  1,  2022  acquisition  of  Ricolino  added  incremental  net  rev enues  of  $507  million (constant currency basis) through the one-year anniv ersary of the acquisition in 2023. Fav orable v olume/mix reflected strong v olume growth as the region continued  to  see  increased  demand  for  most  of  our  snack  category  products.  Fav orable  v olume/mix  was  driv en  by  gains  in  gum,  biscuits  &amp;  baked snacks, candy and cheese &amp; grocery, partially offset by declines in refreshment bev erages and chocolate. Unfav orable currency impacts were primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to a few currencies in the region, primarily the Argentinean peso, partially offset by the strength of most currencies relativ e to the  U.S. dollar, primarily the  Mexican peso and  Brazilian real.  T he impact of our 2022 div estitures resulted in a year-ov er-year decline in net rev enues of $22 million.\n\nSegment  operating  income  increased  $141  million  (36.3%),  primarily  due  to  higher  net  pricing,  the  impact  of  our  Ricolino  acquisition,  fav orable volume/mix, lower manufacturing costs driv en by productiv ity and lapping prior year inv entory step-up charges. T hese fav orable items were partially offset by  higher  raw  material  costs,  higher  other  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses,  higher  adv ertising  and  consumer  promotion  costs,  higher remeasurement loss on net monetary position and higher acquisition integration costs.",

      "question": "How does MDLZ's exclusion of inventory step-up charges in non-GAAP reporting reconcile with their 2023 operating income margin performance and the specific $7 million charge disclosed in 2022's financial breakdown?",
      "answer": "MDLZ excludes inventory step-up charges from Adjusted Operating Income to improve comparability of results, as seen in page 59. In 2023, the company noted that lapping prior-year inventory step-up charges contributed to the improved operating income margin, indicating the removal of this cost positively impacted year-over-year comparisons. Specifically, in 2022, the inventory step-up charge was $7 million, as disclosed in the detailed financial breakdown on page 49. This exclusion aligns with MDLZ's broader non-GAAP approach to remove one-time or non-recurring items to reflect the underlying performance of the business, especially when analyzing year-over-year operating margin trends.",

        "Hop 1: [MDLZ](page_47) \u2192 [Inventory Step-Up Charges]: Inventory step-up charges are referenced as a prior-year item that lapped in 2023, contributing to the improvement in operating income margin from 11.2% to 15.3%.",

Higher net pricing, which included the carryov er impact of pricing actions taken in 2022 as well as the effects of input cost-driv en pricing actions taken during 2023, was reflected across all regions. Ov erall, v olume/mix benefited from improv ed product mix and continued strong demand for our snack category products across most regions. Fav orable v olume/mix was driv en by AMEA, Latin America and Europe, which was marginally offset by slightly unfav orable v olume/mix in North America. The increase in input costs was driv en by higher raw material costs, slightly offset by lower manufacturing costs driv en by productiv ity. Higher raw  material  costs  were  in  part  due  to  higher  energy,  sugar,  grains,  dairy,  cocoa,  packaging,  edible  oils  and  other  ingredients  costs  as  well  as unfav orable year-ov er-year currency exchange transaction costs on imported materials.\n\nT otal selling, general and administrativ e expenses increased $618 million from 2022, due to a number of factors noted in the table abov e, including in part, the impact of acquisitions, higher acquisition integration costs and contingent consideration adjustments, higher div estiture-related costs, higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and lapping prior-year 2017 malware incident net recov eries, which were offset by a lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, a fav orable currency impact related to expenses, lower implementation costs incurred for the Simplify to Grow program, the impact from div estitures and lower incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine. Excluding these factors,  selling,  general  and  administrativ e  expenses  increased  $947  million  from  2022.  T he  increase  was  driv en  primarily  by  higher  adv ertising  and consumer promotion costs and higher ov erhead costs in part due to increased inv estments in route to market capabilities.\n\nUnfavorable currency changes decreased operating income by $190 million, primarily due to the strength of the U.S. dollar relativ e to most currencies, including  the  Russian  ruble, Argentinean  peso,  Egyptian  pound,  Chinese  yuan,  Indian  rupee,  T urkish  lira, Australian  dollar  and  South African  rand, partially offset by the strength of a few currencies relativ e to the U.S. dollar, primarily the euro, Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Polish zloty.\n\nOperating  income  margin  decreased  from  11.2%  in  2022  to  15.3%  in  2023.  T he  decrease  in  operating  income  margin  was  driv en  primarily  by  the fav orable year-ov er-year change in mark-to-market gains/(losses) from currency and commodity hedging activ ities, lapping prior year acquisition-related costs, lower impact from the European Commission legal matter, lower incremental costs due to the war in Ukraine, gain on the sale of our dev eloped market gum business, lower intangible asset impairment charges, higher Adjusted Operating Income margin and lapping prior year inv entory step-up charges,  partially  offset  by  higher  acquisition  integration  costs  and  contingent  consideration  adjustments,  higher  div estiture-related  costs,  higher remeasurement loss of net monetary position and lapping prior year 2017 malware incident net recov eries.

We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions and ev aluate our performance.

      "answer": "MDLZ excluded the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina (above 26% year-over-year) from Organic Net Revenue and related constant currency growth measures starting in Q1 2024 due to hyperinflationary conditions. Despite this exclusion, Organic Net Revenue still grew by 4.3% to $37.1 billion in 2024, driven by net pricing increases. However, this growth was partially offset by $710 million (2.0 percentage points) in unfavorable currency-related items, which included $1,877 million (5.2 pp) of unfavorable currency translation rate changes offset by $1,167 million (3.2 pp) of extreme pricing in Argentina. This suggests that while the company experienced strong pricing momentum, the true underlying growth was partially masked by broader FX headwinds, even after adjusting for extreme pricing.",

The peso's dev aluation and potential resulting distortion on our non-GAAP Organic Net Revenue, Organic Net Revenue growth and other constant currency growth rate measures resulted in our decision to exclude the impact of pricing increases  in  excess  of  26%  year-ov er-year  (\"extreme  pricing\")  in  Argentina,  from  these  measures  beginning  in  Q1  2024.  T he  benchmark  of  26% represents the minimum annual inflation rate for each year ov er a 3-year period which would result in a cumulativ e inflation rate in excess of 100%, the lev el  at  which  an  economy  is  considered  hyperinflationary  under  U.S.  GAAP.  T hroughout  the  following  MD&amp;A  discussion,  we  now  exclude,  on  a prospectiv e basis beginning on January 1, 2024, the impact of extreme pricing in Argentina from the net pricing impact of Organic Net Rev enue and Organic Net Revenue growth and its related impact on our other non-GAAP financial constant currency growth measures with a corresponding offset to changes in currency translation rates.

This is further supported by the detailed rollforward on page 48, which shows these $13 million charges were reclassified as 'Charges against assets' \u2014 directly reducing asset values \u2014 during 2024. The fact that no Incremental Depreciation balance remained at year-end (page 48), despite these charges, suggests Colgate accelerated depreciation fully in 2024 for assets being retired, which aligns with the disclosure on page 86 explaining that Incremental Depreciation reflects changes in useful lives for assets 'taken out of service prior to the end of their normal service period.' This implies a front-loaded financial impact to 2024 with reduced future-period effects.",

      "question": "What was the full financial impact of the 2022 goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges on Colgate-Palmolive's operating performance, cash flow adjustments, and segment-level corporate charges, and how does this reflect its treatment across different financial reporting sections?",
      "answer": "The 2022 goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges of $721 million impacted Colgate-Palmolive's financials in three key ways: (1) it was explicitly listed as a reconciling adjustment in the 2022 operating cash flow, reducing net income to cash flow by that amount; (2) it directly reduced the company's operating profit in 2022, as shown in the income statement; and (3) it was categorized as a Corporate-level charge within segment reporting, indicating it was not part of ongoing operating segment performance. This multi-faceted treatment shows that the impairment was a one-time, non-cash charge that affected profitability and cash flow reconciliation but was excluded from segment-level performance metrics.",

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nIn connection with management changes, the Company realigned the reporting structure of its skin health business effective July 1, 2024. Accordingly, commencing with the quarter ended September 30, 2024, the results of the skin health business previously reported within the Europe reportable operating segment are reported with the other skin health businesses in the North America reportable operating segment, with no impact on the Company's consolidated results of operations or financial position. The Company has recast its historical geographic segment information to conform to the new reporting structure.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes. The Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer has been determined to be the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker who uses Operating Profit to assess performance and to allocate resources for each of the reportable operating segments in the budgeting and forecasting process. Asset information by segment is not utilized for purposes of assessing performance or allocating resources, and therefore such information has not been presented.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation charges and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.\n\nApproximately two-thirds of the Company's Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of the Company's Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 11% of the Company's Net sales in each of the years 2024, 2023 and 2022. No other customer represented more than 10% of Net sales in any period presented.\n\nIn 2024, Corporate Operating profit included charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $85. In 2023, Corporate Operating profit included charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $27 and product recall costs of $25. In 2022, Corporate Operating profit included goodwill and intangible assets impairment charges of $721, charges resulting from the 2022 Global Productivity Initiative of $95, a gain on the sale of land in Asia Pacific of $47 and acquisition-related costs of $19.",

      "question": "How does PepsiCo's allocation of pension-related costs, commodity derivative impacts, and restructuring charges collectively shape the financial performance and accountability of its divisions as reflected in their operating profit?",
      "answer": "PepsiCo's division results reflect operating profit that excludes the impact of changes in pension and retiree medical discount rate assumptions, which are instead recognized in corporate unallocated expenses. Commodity derivatives, when not qualifying for hedge accounting, create mark-to-market volatility that is also held at the corporate level until the underlying commodity cost is recognized in division results. Additionally, restructuring charges from the 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\u2014such as the $350 million in pre-tax charges expected in 2022\u2014are not borne directly by the divisions but are instead managed centrally. Together, these mechanisms insulate division results from certain corporate-level financial fluctuations, aligning accountability with controllable economic outcomes while centralizing the risk and volatility of broader strategic and financial decisions.",

Therefore, the divisions realize the  economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.\n\n## Restructuring and Impairment Charges\n\n## 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\n\nThe 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business  models  to  further  simplify,  harmonize  and  automate  processes;  re-engineer  our  go-to-market  and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019  Productivity  Plan  to  date,  we  expanded  and  extended  the  program  through  the  end  of  2026  to  take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We now expect to incur  pre-tax  charges  of  approximately  $3.15  billion,  including  cash  expenditures  of  approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through December 25, 2021, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.0 billion, including cash expenditures of $776 million. In our 2022 financial results,  we  expect  to  incur  pre-tax  charges  of  approximately  $350  million,  including  cash  expenditures  of approximately $300 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 and 2023 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026.\n\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan.  We  regularly  evaluate  productivity  initiatives  beyond  the  productivity  plan  and  other  initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges\n\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included  in  the  acquisition-date  balance  sheets,  merger  and  integration  charges  and  costs  associated  with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa,  closing  costs,  employee-related  costs,  gains  associated  with  contingent  consideration,  contract termination costs and other integration costs.\n\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact\n\nPension  and  retiree  medical-related  impact  primarily  includes  settlement  charges  related  to  lump  sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains related to plan changes.\n\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.",

      "question": "How do AMESA's acquisition contributions, operating profit margin, and revenue mix collectively indicate its strategic role in PepsiCo's portfolio?",
      "answer": "The acquisition of Pioneer Foods in 2020 contributed $173 million to AMESA's segment results in 2020 (page_115), indicating a major growth driver for the region. However, despite this large acquisition, AMESA's operating profit margin was only 6% in 2021 (page_72), significantly lower than PepsiCo's global average, suggesting integration challenges or margin pressures in the region. Furthermore, AMESA's revenue mix in 2021 was 30% beverage and 70% convenient food (page_73), showing a heavier reliance on food products compared to other regions like Europe. Collectively, these factors highlight that AMESA serves a strategic role in expanding PepsiCo's footprint in emerging markets, particularly in food, but with ongoing challenges in profitability and integration.",

          "chunk_text": "## Mark-to-Market Net Impact\n\nWe centrally manage commodity derivatives on behalf of our divisions. These commodity derivatives include agricultural  products,  energy  and  metals.  Commodity  derivatives  that  do  not  qualify  for  hedge  accounting treatment  are  marked  to  market  each  period  with  the  resulting  gains  and  losses  recorded  in  corporate unallocated expenses as either cost of sales or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the underlying  commodity.  These  gains  and  losses  are  subsequently  reflected  in  division  results  when  the divisions recognize the cost of the underlying commodity in operating profit. Therefore, the divisions realize the  economic effects of the derivative without experiencing any resulting mark-to-market volatility, which remains in corporate unallocated expenses.\n\n## Restructuring and Impairment Charges\n\n## 2019 Multi-Year Productivity Plan\n\nThe 2019 Productivity Plan, publicly announced on February 15, 2019, will leverage new technology and business  models  to  further  simplify,  harmonize  and  automate  processes;  re-engineer  our  go-to-market  and information systems, including deploying the right automation for each market; and simplify our organization and optimize our manufacturing and supply chain footprint. To build on the successful implementation of the 2019  Productivity  Plan  to  date,  we  expanded  and  extended  the  program  through  the  end  of  2026  to  take advantage of additional opportunities within the initiatives of the 2019 Productivity Plan. We now expect to incur  pre-tax  charges  of  approximately  $3.15  billion,  including  cash  expenditures  of  approximately $2.4 billion, as compared to our previous estimate of pre-tax charges of approximately $2.5 billion, which included cash expenditures of approximately $1.6 billion. Plan to date through December 25, 2021, we have incurred pre-tax charges of $1.0 billion, including cash expenditures of $776 million. In our 2022 financial results,  we  expect  to  incur  pre-tax  charges  of  approximately  $350  million,  including  cash  expenditures  of approximately $300 million. These charges will be funded primarily through cash from operations. We expect to incur the majority of the remaining pre-tax charges and cash expenditures in our 2022 and 2023 financial results, with the balance to be incurred through 2026.\n\nSee Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further information related to our 2019 Productivity Plan.  We  regularly  evaluate  productivity  initiatives  beyond  the  productivity  plan  and  other  initiatives discussed above and in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements.\n\n## Acquisition and Divestiture-Related Charges\n\nAcquisition and divestiture-related charges primarily include fair value adjustments to the acquired inventory included  in  the  acquisition-date  balance  sheets,  merger  and  integration  charges  and  costs  associated  with divestitures. Merger and integration charges include liabilities to support socioeconomic programs in South Africa,  closing  costs,  employee-related  costs,  gains  associated  with  contingent  consideration,  contract termination costs and other integration costs.\n\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.\n\n## Pension and Retiree Medical-Related Impact\n\nPension  and  retiree  medical-related  impact  primarily  includes  settlement  charges  related  to  lump  sum distributions exceeding the total of annual service and interest costs, as well as curtailment gains related to plan changes.\n\nSee Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for further information.",

      "question": "How does Coca-Cola's geographic unit case volume performance in 2023 reconcile with the structural changes from acquisitions and refranchising, and how does this reflect the company's global bottling strategy as outlined in the bottler's agreements?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's 2023 unit case volume performance shows regional variation, with growth in Latin America (+5%) and Asia Pacific (+3%), while Europe, Middle East, and Africa declined by 2%, largely due to the suspension of operations in Russia. These regional trends must be viewed alongside structural changes: the refranchising of bottling operations in Vietnam and Cambodia caused a 1% decline in Bottling Investments' unit case volume, while growth in India and South Africa partially offset this. Meanwhile, acquisitions, such as those in Asia Pacific and Malawi, contributed incrementally to volume growth. This aligns with the company's global bottling strategy, where bottler's agreements grant partners exclusive rights in specific territories, reinforcing a decentralized model that allows Coca-Cola to focus on brand strength and concentrate sales, while bottlers manage local execution. The 42% of global unit case volume attributed to the top five bottlers underscores the importance of these partnerships in driving volume growth despite structural shifts.",

      "question": "How do foreign currency fluctuations, regulatory changes, and consumer preference shifts collectively impact Coca-Cola's net operating revenues, and what specific mitigation strategies address each risk?",
      "answer": "Foreign currency fluctuations reduced net operating revenues by 4% in 2023, with a $312 million foreign exchange loss recorded, and Coca-Cola mitigates this through economic hedging with derivative instruments totaling $17.5 billion in notional value. Regulatory changes, particularly around environmental and health-related mandates, increase compliance costs and could reduce revenues, which the company addresses through proactive adaptation and engagement with policymakers. Consumer preference shifts, especially around health concerns and sustainability, pose demand risks for sweetened beverages, prompting Coca-Cola to invest in product innovation, transparency initiatives, and digital transformation to align with evolving expectations.",

      "question": "How did foreign exchange fluctuations and pricing initiatives in 2023 impact the Bottling Investments segment's net operating revenue growth, and how does this compare to its overall contribution to the company's revenue?",
      "answer": "In 2023, the Bottling Investments segment experienced an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange fluctuations due to a stronger U.S. dollar compared to currencies like the Argentine peso, Turkish lira, and Chinese yuan, which reduced its net operating revenue growth. Despite this, the segment benefited from favorable pricing initiatives across most markets, contributing positively to revenue. However, the Bottling Investments segment only accounted for 7.4% of the company\u2019s total net operating revenues in 2023, indicating a relatively modest contribution compared to other segments, even as it faced both headwinds and tailwinds in the global market environment.",

      "question": "How does the performance and strategic positioning of Global Ventures in 2023 reflect in its revenue contribution, pricing initiatives, and operational footprint, and what does this suggest about its role in Coca-Cola's global growth strategy?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Global Ventures contributed 10.7% to Coca-Cola's net operating revenues, showing an increase from 6.5% in 2022, indicating growing strategic importance. The segment experienced favorable pricing initiatives and channel mix, particularly driven by Costa in the UK, though partially offset by unfavorable product mix and the absence of prior-year pandemic-related incentives. Operationally, Global Ventures maintained a significant footprint with 1 owned concentrate plant, 2 owned manufacturing/bottling plants, and 8 leased distribution centers, along with 1,575 leased retail stores\u2014suggesting a focus on direct-to-consumer channels and localized distribution. This combination of rising revenue contribution, targeted pricing strength, and a dense retail presence implies that Global Ventures is being leveraged as a key vehicle for geographic and channel expansion, especially in high-visibility consumer markets.",

      "question": "How does PMI achieve revenue growth and market share expansion in the EA, AU & PMI DF region despite consistent declines in cigarette volume across multiple reporting periods, and what does this reveal about the relative contribution of HTUs versus traditional cigarettes to financial performance?",
      "answer": "PMI achieves revenue growth and market share expansion in the EA, AU & PMI DF region despite declining cigarette volumes by leveraging growth in heated tobacco units (HTUs) and favorable pricing strategies. In one reporting segment, net revenues increased by 7.9%, with HTU volume growth partly offsetting lower cigarette volume. In another, net revenues increased by 4.5%, again driven by higher HTU volume despite lower cigarette volume and unfavorable smoke-free mix. A third section shows net revenue growth of 3.1%, with similar dynamics where HTU volume gains compensated for cigarette declines. Across these periods, PMI's market share in the region increased by 1.3 points to 30.0% and 31.3% in different periods, demonstrating that HTU adoption is effectively countering traditional cigarette volume declines. This reveals that HTUs are increasingly contributing to both revenue and market share growth, with favorable pricing variance playing a complementary role in offsetting the volume losses in traditional cigarettes.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: PM(page_45) \u2192 Cigarette Volume: Cigarette volume decline is noted alongside a 7.9% net revenue increase, showing that despite volume loss, other factors like HTU growth and pricing variance are driving revenue.",
        "Hop 2: PM(page_54) \u2192 Cigarette Volume: Lower cigarette volume is again observed, but offset by HTU volume growth, contributing to a 4.5% net revenue increase and a 1.3-point market share gain in the region.",

On March 14, 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (the \"CJEU\") ruled that the G erman fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. On May 15, 2024, following the decision issued by CJEU, the Fiscal Court in Dusseldorf (the \"FCD\") also ruled that the German fiscal regulation imposing an additional excise tax on HTPs does not contravene EU law. The FCD admitted an appeal to the Federal Tax Court. On June 19, 2024,  PMI submitted an appeal. The negative impact will continue, at least until the appeal ruling on the legality of the surcharge is concluded.  PMI currently accounts for the surcharge as a reduction in net revenues, with amounts withdrawn before May 15, 2024, currently under a payment suspension. Despite this payment suspension and, in order to avoid the future addition of interest, PMI elected, on January 14, 2025, to pay the amount outstanding of EUR 721 million (approximately $751 million), excluding accrued interest. An unfavorable outcome to the appeal would negatively impact PMI's future cash provided by operating activities for the amounts of unpaid interest. A favorable outcome to the appeal would positively impact future PMI's operating results and future cash provided by operating activities for the amounts paid in January 2025.",

We, along with other beverage companies, are affected by a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the cost to manufacture and distribute products, consumer spending, economic conditions, availability and quality of water, consumer preferences, inflation, political climates, local and national laws and regulations, foreign currency fluctuations, fuel prices, weather patterns and the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThroughout 2021, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related actions by governments around the world to attempt to contain the spread of the virus continued to impact our business globally. In particular, the number of people contracting COVID19 and the preventive measures taken to contain COVID-19, including the spread of new variants, negatively impacted our unit case volume and increased our costs to manufacture and distribute our products. Our price, product and geographic mix was also negatively impacted, primarily due to unfavorable channel and product mix as consumer demand shifted to more at-home consumption versus away-from-home consumption. However, the timing and number of people receiving vaccinations, the governmental actions to reopen certain economies around the world, and the substance and pace of the economic recovery favorably impacted our business when compared to 2020. While uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic remain, and factors such as the state of the supply chain, labor shortages and the inflationary environment are likely to impact the pace of the economic recovery, we expect to continue to see improvements in our business as we continue to learn and adapt to the everchanging environment.\n\nThe Company's priorities during the COVID-19 pandemic and related business disruptions are ensuring the health and safety of our employees; supporting and making a difference in the communities we serve; keeping our brands in supply; maintaining the quality and safety of our products; and serving our customers across all channels as they adapt to the shifting demands of consumers during the pandemic.\n\nThroughout the pandemic, business continuity and adapting to the needs of our customers have been critical. We have developed systemwide knowledge-sharing routines and processes, which include the management of any supply chain challenges. As of the date of this filing, while we have experienced some temporary supply chain disruptions, there has been no material impact, and we do not foresee a material impact, on our and our bottling partners' ability to manufacture or distribute our products.",

We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.\n\nWe generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn 2021, the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC ('BodyArmor'). The impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment.\n\nIn 2020, the Company discontinued our Odwalla juice business. The impact of discontinuing our Odwalla juice business has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eightounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa nonready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

          "chunk_text": "Our concentrate operations typically generate net operating revenues by selling concentrates, syrups and certain finished beverages to authorized bottling operations (to which we typically refer as our 'bottlers' or our 'bottling partners'). Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\n\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa Limited ('Costa'). These sales are included in our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. These fountain syrup sales are included in our North America operating segment.\n\nFor information regarding net operating revenues and unit case volume related to our concentrate operations and finished product operations, refer to the heading 'Our Business - General' set forth in Part II, 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of this report.\n\nFor information regarding how we measure the volume of Company beverage products sold by the Company and our bottling partners ('Coca-Cola system'), refer to the heading 'Operations Review - Beverage Volume' set forth in Part II, 'Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' of this report.\n\nWe own and market numerous valuable beverage brands, including the following:\n\n- sparkling soft drinks: Coca-Cola, Diet Coke/Coca-Cola Light, Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, Fanta, Fresca, Schweppes,  Sprite and Thums Up; 1\n- hydration, sports, coffee and tea: Aquarius, Ayataka, BODYARMOR, Ciel, Costa, do\u011fadan, Dasani, FUZE TEA, Georgia, glac\u00e9au smartwater, glac\u00e9au vitaminwater, Gold Peak, Ice Dew, I LOHAS, Powerade and Topo Chico; and\n- nutrition, juice, dairy and plant-based beverages: AdeS, Del Valle, fairlife, innocent, Minute Maid, Minute Maid Pulpy and Simply.\n\nSchweppes is owned by the Company in certain countries other than the United States. 1\n\nIn addition to the beverage brands we own, we also provide marketing support and otherwise participate in the sales of other beverage brands through licenses, joint ventures and strategic partnerships. For example, certain Coca-Cola system bottlers distribute certain brands of Monster Beverage Corporation ('Monster'), primarily Monster Energy, in designated territories in the United States, Canada and other international territories pursuant to distribution coordination agreements between the Company and Monster and related distribution agreements between Monster and Coca-Cola system bottlers.\n\nConsumer demand determines the optimal menu of Company product offerings. Consumer demand can vary from one market to another and can change over time within a single market. Our Company continually seeks to further optimize its portfolio of brands, products and services in order to create and satisfy consumer demand in every market.\n\n## Distribution System\n\nWe make our branded beverage products available to consumers in more than 200 countries and territories through our network of independent bottling partners, distributors, wholesalers and retailers as well as our consolidated bottling and distribution operations. Consumers enjoy finished beverage products bearing trademarks owned by or licensed to the Company at a rate of 2.1 billion servings each day. Our strong and stable bottling and distribution system helps us to capture growth by manufacturing, distributing and selling existing, enhanced and new innovative products to consumers throughout the world.\n\nThe Coca-Cola system sold 31.3 billion and 29.0 billion unit cases of our products in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Sparkling soft drinks represented 69 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in both 2021 and 2020. Trademark Coca-Cola accounted for 47 percent of our worldwide unit case volume in both 2021 and 2020. In 2021, unit case volume in the United States",

      "answer": "Coca-Cola's net operating revenues in 2022 could be significantly impacted by a combination of rising input costs, foreign exchange volatility, and potential financial instability among bottling partners. On page 16, the company notes that rising costs of raw materials, packaging, labor, and transportation\u2014driven by inflation and supply chain disruptions\u2014could not be fully offset by price increases due to consumer sensitivity, potentially reducing sales volume and profitability. On page 23, the company highlights that foreign exchange fluctuations, especially a strong U.S. dollar, could materially affect financial results, as $25.6 billion of net operating revenues in 2021 came from international operations. Finally, on page 21, the company warns that a deterioration in the financial condition of bottling partners could directly reduce revenues from concentrate and syrup sales, particularly for equity method investees where losses could also impact equity income. Together, these factors create a multi-dimensional risk to net operating revenues.",

          "chunk_text": "areas of the world may negatively affect the supply of corn, which in turn may result in shortages of and higher prices for HFCS. The citrus industry is impacted by the variability of weather conditions and by greening disease, which affect the supply and quality of orange juice and orange juice concentrate, which are important raw materials for our business. In particular, freezing weather or hurricanes in central Florida may result in shortages and higher prices for orange juice and orange juice concentrate throughout the industry. In addition, greening disease is reducing the number of citrus trees and increasing grower costs and prices.\n\nAn increase in the cost, a sustained interruption in the supply, or a shortage of some of these ingredients, other raw materials, packaging materials, aluminum cans and other containers that may be caused by changes in or the enactment of new laws and regulations; a deterioration of our or our bottling partners' relationships with suppliers; supplier quality and reliability issues; trade disruptions; changes in supply chain; and increases in tariffs; or events such as natural disasters, widespread outbreaks of infectious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), power outages, labor strikes, political uncertainties or governmental instability, or the like could negatively impact our net operating revenues and profits.\n\n## We may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on various costs, such as our costs for materials and labor, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\nIn connection with our manufacturing and bottling operations, we are dependent upon, among other things, raw materials, packaging materials, plant labor and transportation providers. In 2021 and the early part of 2022, the costs of raw materials, packaging materials, labor, energy, fuel, transportation and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased. In addition, many of these items are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, geopolitical developments, demand for raw materials, weather, growing and harvesting conditions, climate change, energy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, governmental actions, import and export requirements (including tariffs), and other factors beyond our control. We expect the inflationary pressures on input and other costs to continue to impact our business in 2022.\n\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through price increases of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forgo some purchases altogether. To the extent that price increases are not sufficient to offset higher costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\n\n## If we do not successfully integrate and manage our acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our financial results could suffer.\n\nWe routinely evaluate opportunities to acquire businesses or brands to expand our beverage portfolio and capabilities. Additionally, from time to time, we have acquired or taken control of bottling operations, often in underperforming markets where we believe we can use our resources and expertise to improve performance. We may incur unforeseen liabilities and obligations in connection with acquiring businesses, brands or bottling operations. The expected benefits of business or brand acquisitions, including cost and growth synergies associated with such acquisitions, may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all. Moreover, we may encounter challenges to successfully integrating the operations, technologies, services, products and systems of any acquired businesses in an effective, timely and cost-efficient manner. We may also encounter unexpected difficulties, costs or delays in restructuring and integrating acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations into our Company's operating and internal control structures, including extending our Company's internal control over financial reporting to newly acquired businesses, which may increase the risk of failure to prevent misstatements in their financial records and in our consolidated financial statements. In addition, our quality management program, which is designed to ensure product quality and safety, may not be sufficiently robust to effectively manage the expanded range of product offerings introduced through newly acquired businesses or brands, which may increase our costs or subject us to negative publicity. Also, we may not be able to successfully manage the additional complexities involved with overseeing various supply chain models as we expand our product offerings. Our financial performance is impacted by how well we can integrate and manage acquired businesses, brands and bottling operations, and we may not be able to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations. If we incur unforeseen liabilities or costs in connection with acquiring or integrating businesses, brands or bottling operations, experience internal control or product quality failures, or are unable to achieve our strategic and financial objectives for acquired businesses, brands or bottling operations, our consolidated results could be negatively affected.\n\n## If our third-party service providers and business partners do not satisfactorily fulfill their commitments and responsibilities, our financial results could suffer.\n\nIn the conduct of our business, we rely on relationships with third parties, including cloud data storage and other information technology service providers, suppliers, distributors, contractors, joint venture partners and other external business partners, for certain functions or for services in support of key portions of our operations.

Improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation in the United States and internationally or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties, including substantial monetary fines as well as disgorgement of profits.\n\n## Failure to adequately protect, or disputes relating to, trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights could harm our business.\n\nOur trademarks, formulas and other intellectual property rights (refer to the heading 'Patents, Copyrights, Trade Secrets and Trademarks' in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report) are essential to the success of our business. We cannot be certain that the legal steps we are taking around the world are sufficient to protect our intellectual property rights or that, notwithstanding legal protection, others do not or will not infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights, or if changes in laws diminish or remove the current legal protections available to them, the competitiveness of our products may be eroded and our business could suffer. In addition, we could come into conflict with third parties over intellectual property rights, which could result in disruptive and expensive litigation. Any of the foregoing could harm our business.\n\n## Changes in, or failure to comply with, the laws and regulations applicable to our products or our business operations could increase our costs or reduce our net operating revenues.\n\nOur Company is subject to various laws and regulations in the numerous countries throughout the world in which we do business, including laws and regulations relating to competition, product safety, advertising and labeling, container deposits, recycling and product stewardship, the protection of the environment, occupational health and safety, employment and labor practices, personal data protection and privacy, and data security. For additional information regarding laws and regulations applicable to our business, refer to the heading 'Governmental Regulation' set forth in Part I, 'Item 1. Business' of this report. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased or additional regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change; to discourage the use of plastic materials, including regulations relating to recovery and/or disposal of plastic bottles and other packaging materials due to environmental concerns; or to limit or impose additional costs on commercial water use due to local water scarcity concerns, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures and other financial obligations for us and our bottling partners, which could affect our profitability, or may impede the production, distribution, marketing and sale of our products, which could affect our net operating revenues. In addition, failure to comply with various laws and regulations, such as U.S. trade sanctions, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control trade sanction regulations and anti-boycott regulations, antitrust and competition laws, anti-modern slavery laws, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, data privacy laws, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, tax laws and regulations and a variety of other applicable local, national and multinational regulations and laws could result in litigation, the assessment of damages, the imposition of penalties, suspension of production or distribution, costly changes to equipment or processes due to required corrective action, or a cessation or interruption of operations at our or our bottling partners' facilities, as well as damage to our or our bottling partners' image and reputation, all of which could harm our or our bottling partners' profitability.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO FINANCE, ACCOUNTING AND INVESTMENTS\n\n## Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n\nWe earn revenues, pay expenses, own assets and incur liabilities in countries using many currencies other than the U.S. dollar. In 2021, we used 70 functional currencies in addition to the U.S. dollar and derived $25.6 billion of net operating revenues from operations outside the United States. Because our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, we must translate revenues, income and expenses, as well as assets and liabilities, into U.S. dollars at exchange rates in effect during or at the end of each reporting period. Therefore, increases or decreases in the value of the U.S. dollar against other currencies affect our net operating revenues, operating income and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Because of the geographic diversity of our operations, weakness in some currencies may be offset by strength in others over time. We also use derivative financial instruments to further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. However, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies or the currencies of large developing countries, could materially affect our financial results.\n\n## If interest rates increase, our net income could be negatively affected.\n\nWe maintain levels of debt that we consider prudent based on our cash flows, interest coverage ratio and percentage of debt to capital. We use debt financing to lower our cost of capital, which increases our return on shareowners' equity. This exposes us to adverse changes in interest rates. When and to the extent appropriate, we use derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risks. However, our financial risk management program may not be successful in reducing the risks inherent in exposures to interest rate fluctuations. On December 31, 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, the governing body responsible for regulating the London Interbank Offered Rate ('LIBOR'), ceased to publish certain LIBOR reference rates. However, other LIBOR reference rates, including U.S. dollar overnight, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month and",

In addition, we have investments in certain of our bottling partners, which we account for under the equity method, and our operating results include our proportionate share of such bottling partners' income or loss. Our bottling partners' financial condition is affected in large part by conditions and events that are beyond our and their control, including competitive and general market conditions; the availability of capital and other financing resources on reasonable terms; loss of major customers; changes in or additional regulations; or disruptions of bottling operations that may be caused by strikes, work stoppages, labor unrest, natural disasters or other catastrophic events. A deterioration of the financial condition or results of operations of one or more of our major bottling partners could adversely affect our net operating revenues from sales of concentrates and syrups; and, if such deterioration involves one or more of our equity method investee bottling partners, it could also result in a decrease in our equity income and/or impairments of our equity method investments.\n\n## We may from time to time engage in refranchising activities or divestitures of certain brands or businesses, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n\nAs part of our strategic initiative to focus on our core business of building brands and leading our system of bottling partners, we continue to seek opportunities to refranchise our consolidated bottling operations. Our refranchising activities require significant attention and effort on the part of, and therefore may be a distraction for, senior management. If we are unable to complete future refranchising transactions on terms and conditions favorable to us, or if our refranchising partners are not efficient or not aligned with our long-term vision for the Coca-Cola system, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, we have divested and may in the future divest certain brands or businesses. These divestitures may adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition if we are unable to offset impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested brands or businesses, or if we are otherwise unable to achieve the anticipated benefits or cost savings from such divestitures.\n\n## RISKS RELATED TO REGULATORY AND LEGAL MATTERS\n\nIncreases in income tax rates, changes in income tax laws, regulations or unfavorable resolutions of tax matters could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\n\nWe are subject to income tax in the United States and numerous other jurisdictions in which we generate profits. Our overall effective income tax rate is a function of applicable local tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate, tax treaties between such jurisdictions, and the geographic mix of our income before income taxes, which is itself impacted by currency movements. Consequently, the isolated or combined effects of unfavorable movements in tax rates, geographic mix or foreign exchange rates could reduce our net income. Tax laws and regulations, including rates of taxation, are subject to revision by individual taxing jurisdictions which may result from multilateral agreements. Many jurisdictions have enacted legislation and adopted policies resulting from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development's ('OECD') anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project. The OECD is currently coordinating a project on behalf of the G20 and other participating countries which would grant additional taxing rights over profits earned by multinational enterprises to the countries in which their products are sold and services rendered. A second pillar would establish a global per-country minimum tax of 15 percent. It is possible that the adoption of these or other proposals could have a material impact on our net income and cash flows. Significant judgment is required in determining our annual income tax expense and in evaluating our tax positions. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions, estimates and accruals. The results of audits or related disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made and for periods for which the statute of limitations is open.\n\nFor instance, the United States Internal Revenue Service ('IRS') is seeking to increase our U.S. taxable income for tax years 2007 through 2009 by an amount that creates a potential additional U.S. federal income tax liability of approximately $3.3 billion for that period, plus interest. The Company firmly believes that the IRS' claims are without merit and is pursuing, and will continue to pursue, all available administrative and judicial remedies necessary to vigorously defend its position. On November 18, 2020, the U.S. Tax Court ('Tax Court') issued an opinion ('Opinion') predominantly siding with the IRS. Although the Company disagrees with the unfavorable portions of the Opinion and intends to vigorously defend its position, considering all avenues of appeal, there is no assurance that the courts will ultimately rule in the Company's favor. It is therefore possible that all or some of the unfavorable portions of the Opinion could ultimately be upheld. In that event, the Company would be subject to significant additional liabilities for the years at issue and potentially also for the subsequent years if the unfavorable portions of the Opinion were to be applied to the foreign licensees covered within the scope of the Opinion. Moreover, the IRS could successfully appeal the portions of the Opinion that are favorable to the Company and/or assert new claims for additional tax relating to the subsequent years by broadening the scope to cover additional foreign licensees. These adjustments could have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations and cash flows. Any such adjustments related to years prior to 2018, either in the litigation period or thereafter, may also have an impact on the",

This favorable impact was primarily due to a weaker U.S. dollar compared to certain foreign currencies, including the British pound sterling, South African rand, euro, Chinese yuan and Mexican peso, which had a favorable impact on our Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; Latin America; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments operating segments. The favorable impact of a weaker U.S. dollar compared to the currencies listed above was partially offset by the impact of a stronger U.S. dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies, including the Argentine peso, Brazilian real, Turkish lira, Ethiopian birr and Japanese yen, which had an unfavorable impact on our Latin America; Europe, Middle East and Africa; Asia Pacific; and Bottling Investments operating segments. Refer to the heading 'Liquidity, Capital Resources and Financial Position - Foreign Exchange' below.\n\n'Acquisitions and divestitures' generally refers to acquisitions and divestitures of brands or businesses, some of which the Company considers to be structural changes. The impact of acquisitions and divestitures is the difference between the change in net operating revenues and the change in what our net operating revenues would have been if we removed the net operating revenues associated with an acquisition or a divestiture from either the current year or the prior year, as applicable. Management believes that quantifying the impact that acquisitions and divestitures had on the Company's net operating revenues provides investors with useful information to enhance their understanding of the Company's net operating revenue performance by improving their ability to compare our year-to-year results. Management considers the impact of acquisitions and divestitures when evaluating the Company's performance. Refer to the heading 'Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands' above for additional information related to acquisitions and divestitures.\n\nNet operating revenue growth rates are impacted by sales volume; price, product and geographic mix; foreign currency fluctuations; and acquisitions and divestitures. The size and timing of acquisitions and divestitures are not consistent from period to period. Based on current spot rates and our hedging coverage in place, we expect foreign currency fluctuations will have a negative impact on our full year 2022 net operating revenues.\n\nInformation about our net operating revenues by operating segment and Corporate as a percentage of Company net operating revenues is as follows:\n\n",

The fair value of our previously held equity investment was determined using a discounted cash flow model based on Level 3 inputs. The net loss was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nDuring 2021, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $2,180 million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited ('CCA'), an equity method investee, to Coca-Cola Europacific Partners plc ('CCEP'), also an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $1,738 million and recognized a net gain of $695 million as a result of the sale and the related reversal of cumulative translation adjustments. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $293 million and recognized a net gain of $114 million as a result of these sales.\n\nDuring 2020, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $189 million, which primarily related to the sale of our ownership interest in Piedmont Coca-Cola Bottling Partnership to Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc., an equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $100 million and recognized a net loss of $2 million as a result of this sale. Also included were the sale of our ownership interest in an equity method investee and the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in another equity method investee. We received cash proceeds of $62 million and recognized a net gain of $35 million as a result of these sales.\n\nDuring 2019, proceeds from disposals of businesses, equity method investments and nonmarketable securities totaled $429 million, which primarily related to the sale of a portion of our ownership interest in Embotelladora Andina S.A. ('Andina') and the refranchising of certain of our bottling operations in India. As a result of these transactions, we recognized gains of $39 million and $73 million, respectively. We continue to account for our remaining ownership interest in Andina as an equity method investment as a result of our representation on Andina's Board of Directors and other governance rights.\n\n## Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited\n\nDue to the Company's original intent to refranchise Coca-Cola Beverages Africa Proprietary Limited ('CCBA'), it was accounted for as held for sale and as a discontinued operation from October 2017 through the first quarter of 2019. Additionally, CCBA's property, plant and equipment was not depreciated and its definite-lived intangible assets were not amortized during this period. While the Company had discussions with a number of potential partners throughout the period CCBA was held for sale, during the second quarter of 2019 the Company updated its plans with the intent to maintain its controlling stake in CCBA, which resulted in CCBA no longer qualifying as held for sale or as a discontinued operation. As a result of this change, we recorded a $160 million adjustment to reduce the carrying value of CCBA's property, plant and equipment and definite-lived intangible assets by an additional $34 million and $126 million, respectively, to reflect additional depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized during the period CCBA was held for sale. This adjustment was recorded in the line item other income (loss) - net in our consolidated statement of income.\n\n## Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale\n\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had certain bottling operations in Asia Pacific that met the criteria to be classified as held for sale. As a result, we were required to record their assets and liabilities at the lower of carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. As the fair value less any costs to sell exceeded the carrying value, the related assets and liabilities were recorded at their carrying value. These assets and liabilities were included in the Bottling Investments operating segment. The Company expects these bottling operations to be refranchised during 2022.",

Our bottling partners either combine concentrates with still or sparkling water and sweeteners (depending on the product), or combine syrups with still or sparkling water, to produce finished beverages. The finished beverages are packaged in authorized containers, such as cans and refillable and nonrefillable glass and plastic bottles, bearing our trademarks or trademarks licensed to us and are then sold to retailers directly or, in some cases, through wholesalers or other bottlers. In addition, outside the United States, our bottling partners are typically authorized to manufacture fountain syrups, using our concentrates, which they sell to fountain retailers for use in producing beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers who in turn sell and distribute the fountain syrups to fountain retailers. Our concentrate operations are included in our geographic operating segments and our Global Ventures operating segment.\n\nOur finished product operations generate net operating revenues by selling sparkling soft drinks and a variety of other finished beverages to retailers, or to distributors and wholesalers who in turn sell the beverages to retailers. These operations consist primarily of our consolidated bottling and distribution operations, which are included in our Bottling Investments operating segment. In certain markets, the Company also operates non-bottling finished product operations in which we sell finished beverages to distributors and wholesalers that are generally not one of the Company's bottling partners. These operations are generally included in one of our geographic operating segments or our Global Ventures operating segment. Additionally, we sell directly to consumers through retail stores operated by Costa. These sales are included in our Global Ventures operating segment. In the United States, we manufacture fountain syrups and sell them to fountain retailers, who use the fountain syrups to produce beverages for immediate consumption, or to authorized fountain wholesalers or bottling partners who in turn sell the fountain syrups to fountain retailers.

      "question": "How do Coca-Cola's structural changes and licensing practices affect the interpretation of its reported concentrate sales volume growth rates of 6% in Latin America, 7% in North America, and 11% in Asia Pacific?",
      "answer": "Coca-Cola's concentrate sales volume growth figures must be interpreted in light of its accounting policies and business practices around structural changes and licensing agreements. According to page 45, the company typically does not recognize concentrate sales volume from acquired or licensed brands in periods prior to the transaction or licensing agreement, making these volumes entirely incremental to the current period's growth. This suggests that any acquisitions or new licensing deals in Latin America, North America, or Asia Pacific would artificially inflate the reported growth rates, as these volumes weren't present in prior years for comparison. Page 51 shows that Latin America, North America, and Asia Pacific reported concentrate sales volume growth of 6%, 7%, and 11% respectively, which may include such incremental volume from acquisitions or licensing. Furthermore, page 44 clarifies that the timing of concentrate revenue and volume recognition depends on the ownership structure of bottling partners\u2014sales to unconsolidated partners are recognized immediately, while sales to consolidated partners are deferred until the partner sells finished products to third parties. This means that structural changes involving bottling operations could delay or accelerate the recognition of concentrate sales volume, further influencing the regional growth percentages. Therefore, the reported growth rates cannot be viewed in isolation but must be analyzed alongside the company's structural and licensing activity to determine the true organic performance of each region.",

          "chunk_text": "a third party. We typically report unit case volume when finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups are sold to a third party, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any.\n\nWe generally refer to acquisitions and divestitures of bottling operations as 'structural changes,' which are a component of acquisitions and divestitures. Typically, structural changes do not impact the Company's unit case volume or concentrate sales volume on a consolidated basis or at the geographic operating segment level. We recognize unit case volume for all sales of Company beverage products, regardless of our ownership interest in the bottling partner, if any. However, the unit case volume reported by our Bottling Investments operating segment is generally impacted by structural changes because it only includes the unit case volume of our consolidated bottling operations. Refer to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's acquisitions and divestitures.\n\n'Acquired brands' refers to brands acquired during the past 12 months. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to acquired brands in periods prior to the closing of a transaction. Therefore, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to an acquired brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the acquisition of a brand to be a structural change.\n\n'Licensed brands' refers to brands not owned by the Company but for which we hold certain rights, generally including, but not limited to, distribution rights, and from which we derive an economic benefit when the products are sold. Typically, the Company has not reported unit case volume or recognized concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand in periods prior to the beginning of the term of a license agreement. Therefore, in the year that a license agreement is entered into, the unit case volume and concentrate sales volume related to a licensed brand are incremental to prior year volume. We generally do not consider the licensing of a brand to be a structural change.\n\nIn 2021, the Company acquired the remaining ownership interest in BA Sports Nutrition, LLC ('BodyArmor'). The impact of this acquisition has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment.\n\nIn 2020, the Company discontinued our Odwalla juice business. The impact of discontinuing our Odwalla juice business has been included in acquisitions and divestitures in our analysis of net operating revenues on a consolidated basis as well as for the North America operating segment.\n\n## Beverage Volume\n\nWe measure the volume of Company beverage products sold in two ways: (1) unit cases of finished products and (2) concentrate sales. As used in this report, 'unit case' means a unit of measurement equal to 192 U.S. fluid ounces of finished beverage (24 eightounce servings), with the exception of unit case equivalents for Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, which are primarily measured in number of transactions; and 'unit case volume' means the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers. Unit case volume consists primarily of beverage products bearing Company trademarks. Also included in unit case volume are certain brands licensed to, or distributed by, our Company, and brands owned by Coca-Cola system bottlers for which our Company provides marketing support and from the sale of which we derive an economic benefit. In addition, unit case volume includes sales by certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest. We believe unit case volume is one of the measures of the underlying strength of the Coca-Cola system because it measures trends at the consumer level. The unit case volume numbers used in this report are derived based on estimates received by the Company from its bottling partners and distributors. Concentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished beverages sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa nonready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates are not necessarily equal during any given period. Factors such as seasonality, bottlers' inventory practices, supply point changes, timing of price increases, new product introductions and changes in product mix can create differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates. In addition to these items, the impact of unit case volume from certain joint ventures in which the Company has an ownership interest, but to which the Company does not sell concentrates, syrups, source waters or powders/minerals, may give rise to differences between unit case volume and concentrate sales volume growth rates.",

The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 6 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and package mix, and lower other operating charges, partially offset by higher annual incentive expense and increased marketing spending.\n\nOperating income for North America for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $3,331 million and $2,471 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 7 percent, favorable pricing initiatives, favorable channel and category mix, effective cost management and lower other operating charges, partially offset by higher annual incentive expense and increased marketing spending.\n\nAsia Pacific's operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,325 million and $2,133 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by concentrate sales volume growth of 11 percent, a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 4 percent and lower other operating charges, partially offset by higher annual incentive expense and increased marketing spending.\n\nGlobal Ventures' operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $293 million, while the operating segment's operating loss for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $123 million. The change in operating income was primarily driven by revenue growth as a result of the reopening of Costa retail stores in the United Kingdom and a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 6 percent.\n\nBottling Investments' operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $473 million and $308 million, respectively. The increase in operating income was primarily driven by volume growth of 11 percent, lower other operating charges and favorable price, category and package mix, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate impact of 1 percent.\n\nCorporate's operating loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $2,383 million and $1,221 million, respectively. Operating loss in 2021 increased primarily as a result of higher annual incentive and stock-based compensation expense, increased marketing spending, increased charitable donations and higher other operating charges.\n\n## Interest Income\n\nInterest income was $276 million in 2021, compared to $370 million in 2020, a decrease of $94 million, or 25 percent. This decrease was primarily driven by lower interest rates in certain of our international locations as well as lower investment balances.\n\n## Interest Expense\n\nInterest expense was $1,597 million in 2021, compared to $1,437 million in 2020, an increase of $160 million, or 11 percent. This increase was primarily due to charges of $650 million in 2021 versus charges of $484 million in 2020 associated with the extinguishment of long-term debt. Refer to Note 10 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Equity Income (Loss) - Net\n\nEquity income (loss) - net represents our Company's proportionate share of net income or loss from each of our equity method investees. In 2021, equity income was $1,438 million, compared to equity income of $978 million in 2020, an increase of $460 million, or 47 percent. This increase reflects, among other items, the impact of more favorable operating results reported by most of our equity method investees in 2021, as results in 2020 were more negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, along with a favorable foreign currency exchange rate impact. In addition, the Company recorded net charges of $13 million and $216 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which represent the Company's proportionate share of significant operating and nonoperating items recorded by certain of our equity method investees.",

The tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year and for the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of all available information, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not.\n\nWe evaluate our ability to realize the tax benefits associated with deferred tax assets by analyzing our forecasted taxable income using both historical and projected future operating results; the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences; taxable income in prior carryback years (if permitted); and the availability of tax planning strategies. A valuation allowance is required to be established unless management determines that it is more likely than not that the Company will ultimately realize the tax benefit associated with a deferred tax asset.\n\nThe Company does not record a U.S. deferred tax liability for the excess of the book basis over the tax basis of its investments in foreign subsidiaries to the extent that the basis difference meets the indefinite reversal criteria. These criteria are met if the foreign subsidiary has invested, or will invest, the undistributed earnings indefinitely. The decision as to the amount of undistributed earnings that the Company intends to maintain in non-U.S. subsidiaries takes into account items including, but not limited to, forecasts and budgets of financial needs of cash for working capital, liquidity plans, capital improvement programs, merger and acquisition plans, and planned loans to other non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company also evaluates its expected cash requirements in the United States. Other factors that can influence that determination are local restrictions on remittances (for example, in some countries a central bank application and approval are required in order for the Company's local country subsidiary to pay a dividend), economic stability and asset risk. Refer to Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Operations Review\n\nOur organizational structure consists of the following operating segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa; Latin America; North America; Asia Pacific; Global Ventures; and Bottling Investments. Our operating structure also includes Corporate, which consists of a center and a platform services organization. For additional information regarding our operating segments and Corporate, refer to Note 19 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Structural Changes, Acquired Brands and Newly Licensed Brands\n\nIn order to continually improve upon the Company's operating performance, from time to time, we engage in buying and selling ownership interests in bottling partners and other manufacturing operations. In addition, we also acquire brands and their related operations or enter into license agreements for certain brands to supplement our beverage offerings. These items impact our operating results and certain key metrics used by management in assessing the Company's performance.\n\nUnit case volume growth is a metric used by management to evaluate the Company's performance because it measures demand for our products at the consumer level. The Company's unit case volume represents the number of unit cases (or unit case equivalents) of Company beverage products directly or indirectly sold by the Company and its bottling partners to customers or consumers and, therefore, reflects unit case volume for both consolidated and unconsolidated bottlers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nConcentrate sales volume represents the amount of concentrates, syrups, source waters and powders/minerals (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents) sold by, or used in finished products sold by, the Company to its bottling partners or other customers. For Costa non-ready-to-drink beverage products, concentrate sales volume represents the amount of beverages, primarily measured in number of transactions (in all instances expressed in unit case equivalents), sold by the Company to customers or consumers. Refer to the heading 'Beverage Volume' below.\n\nWhen we analyze our net operating revenues, we generally consider the following factors: (1) volume growth (concentrate sales volume or unit case volume, as applicable); (2) changes in price, product and geographic mix; (3) foreign currency fluctuations; and (4) acquisitions and divestitures (including structural changes defined below), as applicable. Refer to the heading 'Net Operating Revenues' below. The Company sells concentrates and syrups to both consolidated and unconsolidated bottling partners. The ownership structure of our bottling partners impacts the timing of recognizing concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our consolidated bottling partners, we do not recognize the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume until the bottling partner has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party. When we sell concentrates or syrups to our unconsolidated bottling partners, we recognize the concentrate revenue and concentrate sales volume when the concentrates or syrups are sold to the bottling partner. The subsequent sale of the finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to a third party does not impact the timing of recognizing the concentrate revenue or concentrate sales volume. When we account for an unconsolidated bottling partner as an equity method investment, we eliminate the intercompany profit related to these transactions to the extent of our ownership interest until the equity method investee has sold finished products manufactured from the concentrates or syrups to",

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's expected future funding for Other Retiree Benefits shows a gradual increase in payments over the next five years, from $177 million in 2023 to $198 million in 2027, with an additional $1,076 million expected from 2028 to 2032. This trajectory aligns with the recent net periodic benefit credits, which were negative costs of $474 million in 2022, indicating a surplus or favorable actuarial gains in the plan. However, the long-term liabilities recognized on the balance sheet as of June 30, 2022, show a net noncurrent liability of $672 million for Other Retiree Benefits, suggesting that despite short-term credits, the company still carries a significant long-term obligation.

      "answer": "Procter & Gamble's adjusted free cash flow productivity in 2022 was 93%, which remains above its long-term target of 90%, but represents a decline from the prior year's 107%. This decrease was primarily driven by lower operating cash flows, influenced by factors such as increased inventory levels ($1.2 billion usage of cash) due to business growth and higher commodity costs, as well as transitional tax payments and pension contributions. Despite these challenges, the company maintained strong cash generation capabilities, with adjusted free cash flow totaling $13.8 billion in 2022, reflecting its ability to manage working capital through extended payment terms with suppliers and strategic capital allocation.",

          "chunk_text": "sales  outstanding  increased  approximately  1  day  versus prior year.\n\n- Higher inventory used $1.2 billion of cash, due to business  growth  and  increased  safety  stock  levels  to strengthen supply chain sufficiency amidst business growth and commodity cost increases. Inventory days on hand increased approximately 1 day primarily due to these same factors.\n- Accounts payable, accrued and other liabilities generated $1.4  billion  of  cash. Accounts  payable  increased  in  line with the increase in inventory and, to a lesser extent, the impact  of  extended  payment  terms  with  suppliers  (see Extended  Payment  Terms  and  Supply  Chain  Financing below);  partially  offset  by  lower  marketing  spending. Days payable outstanding increased approximately 1 day versus prior year due to these same factors.\n- Other net operating assets and liabilities  used  $406 million of cash primarily driven by the current portion of transitional tax payments due related to the U.S. Tax Act and pension related contributions, partially offset by other impacts.\n\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow. We view adjusted free cash flow as an important non-GAAP  measure  because  it  is  a  factor impacting  the  amount  of  cash  available  for  dividends,  share repurchases, acquisitions and other discretionary investments. It  is  defined  as  operating  cash  flow  less  capital  expenditures and excluding payments for the transitional tax resulting from the  U.S.  Tax  Act.  Adjusted  free  cash  flow  is  one  of  the measures used to evaluate senior management and determine their at-risk compensation.\n\nAdjusted free cash flow was $13.8 billion in 2022, a decrease of  13%  versus  the  prior  year.  The  decrease  was  primarily driven  by  the  decrease  in  operating  cash  flows  as  discussed above.  Adjusted  free  cash  flow  productivity,  defined  as  the ratio  of  adjusted  free  cash  flow  to  net  earnings  was  93%  in 2022.\n\nExtended  Payment  Terms  and  Supply  Chain  Financing. Beginning  in  fiscal  2014,  in  response  to  evolving  market practices, the Company began a program to negotiate extended payment  terms  with  its  suppliers.  At  the  same  time,  the Company  initiated  a  Supply  Chain  Finance  program  (the \"SCF\")  with  a  number  of  global  financial  institutions  (the \"SCF Banks\"). Under the SCF, qualifying suppliers may elect to  sell  their  receivables  from  the  Company  to  a  SCF  Bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements  directly  with  the  respective  SCF  Bank.  While the Company is not party to those agreements, the SCF Banks allow  the  participating  suppliers  to  utilize  the  Company's creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. This generally provides the suppliers with more favorable  terms  than  they  would  be  able  to  secure  on  their own. The Company has no economic interest in a supplier's decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to  participate  in  the  SCF  and  reaches  an  agreement  with  an SCF Bank, they elect which individual Company invoices they sell to the SCF bank. However, all the Company's payments to participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The SCF Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold to the SCF Bank under the SCF.\n\nThe  terms  of  the  Company's  payment  obligation  are  not impacted by a supplier's participation in the  SCF.  Our payment  terms  with  our  suppliers  for  similar  services  and materials  within  individual  markets  are  consistent  between suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those that do not participate. Accordingly, our average days outstanding are not  significantly  impacted  by  the  portion  of  suppliers  or related input costs that are included in the SCF. In addition, the SCF  is available to both material suppliers, where the underlying  costs  are  largely  included  in  Cost  of  goods  sold, and to service suppliers, where the underlying costs are largely included in SG&amp;A. As of June 30, 2022, approximately 3% of our  global  suppliers  have  elected  to  participate  in  the  SCF. Payments  to  those  suppliers  during  fiscal  year  2022  total approximately  $15  billion,  which  equals  approximately  25% of  our  total  Cost  of  goods  sold  and  SG&amp;A  for  the  year.  For participating  suppliers,  we  believe  substantially  all  of  their receivables  with  the  Company  are  sold  to  the  SCF  Banks. Accordingly, we would expect that at each balance sheet date, a  similar  proportion  of  amounts  originally  due  to  suppliers would  instead  be  payable  to  SCF  Banks.  All  outstanding amounts  related  to  suppliers  participating  in  the  SCF  are recorded within Accounts payable in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. As  of  June  30,  2022  and  2021,  the  amount  due  to  suppliers participating  in  the  SCF  and  included  in  Accounts  payable were approximately $6 billion and $5 billion, respectively.\n\nAlthough difficult to project due to market and other dynamics, we anticipate incremental cash flow benefits from the extended payment terms with suppliers could increase at a slower  rate  in  fiscal  2023.  Future  changes  in  our  suppliers' financing policies or economic developments, such as changes in  interest  rates,  general  market  liquidity  or  the  Company's credit-worthiness relative to participating suppliers,  could impact suppliers' participation in the SCF and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to predict.\n\n## Investing Cash Flow\n\nNet  investing  activities  used  $4.4  billion  of  cash  in  2022, primarily due to capital spending and acquisitions.  Net investing  activities  used  $2.8  billion  in  cash  in  2021,  mainly due to capital spending.\n\nCapital  Spending. Capital  expenditures,  primarily  to  support capacity expansion, innovation and cost efficiencies, were $3.2 billion in 2022 and $2.8 billion in 2021. Capital spending as a percentage  of  net  sales  increased  20  basis  points  to  3.9%  in 2022.",

      "question": "How do the Beauty segment's recent acquisitions (Farmacy Beauty, Ouai, and TULA) align with its financial contribution to P&G, and what risks might these acquisitions face given P&G's historical goodwill impairment patterns in other segments?",
      "answer": "The Beauty segment contributed 18% of P&G\u2019s net sales and 22% of net earnings in fiscal 2022, indicating a significant financial role within the company. This segment saw an increase in goodwill due to the acquisitions of Farmacy Beauty, Ouai, and TULA, which were specifically called out in the impairment testing section. However, the Grooming segment\u2019s history of $7.9 billion in accumulated goodwill impairment losses highlights the risk that newly acquired brands\u2014despite their current strategic appeal\u2014could face similar impairment pressures in the future if macroeconomic conditions, competitive dynamics, or internal performance metrics deteriorate. This context suggests that while the Beauty segment\u2019s acquisitions may currently be viewed as value-accretive, they remain subject to the same market and management risks that have historically affected other segments.",

          "chunk_text": "\nGrooming goodwill balance is net of $7.9 billion accumulated impairment losses. (1)\n\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing the estimated fair values of our reporting  units  and  underlying  indefinite-lived  intangible  assets  to  their  respective  carrying  values. We  typically  use  an  income method to estimate the fair value of these assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective  assets.  Significant  estimates  and  assumptions  inherent  in  the  valuations  reflect  a  consideration  of  other  marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability). Significant judgement by management is required to estimate the impact of macroeconomic and other factors on future cash flows, including those  related  to  the  COVID-19  pandemic  and  the  Russia-Ukraine  War.  Estimates  utilized  in  the  projected  cash  flows  include consideration  of  macroeconomic  conditions,  overall  category  growth  rates,  competitive  activities,  cost  containment  and  margin expansion, Company business plans, the underlying product or technology life cycles, economic barriers to entry, a brand's relative market position and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\n\nWe believe the estimates and assumptions utilized in our impairment testing are reasonable and are comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants. However, actual events and results could differ substantially from those used in our valuations. To the extent such factors result in a failure to achieve the level of projected cash flows initially used to estimate fair value for purposes of establishing or subsequently impairing the carrying amount of goodwill and related intangible assets, we may need to record additional non-cash impairment charges in the future.\n\nGoodwill  decreased  during  fiscal  2022  due  to  currency  translation  across  all  reportable  segments,  partially  offset  by  three acquisitions (Farmacy Beauty, Ouai and TULA) in the Beauty reportable segment.\n\nHowever, for information purposes, the following table summarizes the total restructuring costs related to our reportable segments:\n\n",

The fair values of long-term debt and financial instruments are disclosed in Note 9.\n\n## New Accounting Pronouncements and Policies\n\nIn  March  2020,  the  Financial  Accounting  Standards  Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2020-04, \"Reference  Rate  Reform  (Topic  848):  Facilitation  of  the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\" In January  2021,  the  FASB  issued  ASU  2021-01,  \"Reference Rate  Reform  (Topic  848):  Scope.\"  The  amendments  were effective  upon  issuance  and  provide  optional  expedients  and exceptions for applying generally accepted accounting principles  (GAAP)  to  contracts,  hedging  relationships  and other transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met.  We  have completed our evaluation of significant  contracts.  Most  contracts  reviewed  will  mature prior to the termination of LIBOR or will be modified to apply a new reference rate, primarily the Secured Overnight Financing  Rate  (SOFR)  where  applicable.  As  a  result,  the guidance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, \"Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance\". This guidance requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are  accounted  for  by  applying  a  grant  or contribution model. These amendments  are effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption  permitted.  We  plan  to  adopt  the  standard  for  the fiscal  year  ending  June  30,  2023. We  are  currently  assessing the  impact  of  this  guidance  and  do  not  expect  a  material impact at this time.\n\nNo other new accounting pronouncements issued or effective during the fiscal year or in future years had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## NOTE 2\n\n## SEGMENT INFORMATION\n\nUnder U.S. GAAP, our operating segments are aggregated into five  reportable  segments:  1)  Beauty,  2)  Grooming,  3)  Health Care,  4)  Fabric  &amp;  Home  Care  and  5)  Baby,  Feminine  &amp; Family Care. Our five reportable segments are comprised of:\n\n- Beauty :  Hair  Care  (Conditioner,  Shampoo,  Styling Aids, Treatments); Skin and Personal Care (Antiperspirant and Deodorant, Personal Cleansing, Skin Care);\n\nAmounts in millions of dollars except per share amounts or as otherwise specified.\n\n- Grooming :  Shave  Care  (Female  Blades  &amp;  Razors,  Male Blades  &amp;  Razors,  Pre-  and  Post-Shave  Products,  Other Shave Care); Appliances\n- Health Care : Oral Care (Toothbrushes, Toothpaste, Other Oral Care); Personal Health Care (Gastrointestinal, Rapid Diagnostics, Respiratory, Vitamins/Minerals/Supplements, Pain Relief, Other Personal Health Care);\n- Fabric  &amp;  Home  Care :  Fabric  Care  (Fabric  Enhancers, Laundry Additives, Laundry Detergents); Home Care (Air Care, Dish Care, P&amp;G Professional, Surface Care); and\n- Baby, Feminine &amp; Family Care : Baby Care (Baby Wipes, Taped Diapers and Pants); Feminine Care (Adult Incontinence, Feminine Care); Family Care (Paper Towels, Tissues, Toilet Paper).\n\nWhile  none  of  our  reportable  segments  are  highly  seasonal, components within certain reportable segments, such as Appliances  (Grooming)  and  Personal  Health  Care  (Health), are seasonal.\n\nThe  accounting  policies  of  the  segments  are  generally  the same as those described in Note 1. Differences between these policies and U.S. GAAP primarily reflect income taxes, which are reflected in the segments using applicable blended statutory rates. Adjustments to arrive at our effective tax rate are included in Corporate. In addition, capital expenditures in the  segments  are  on  an  accrual  basis  consistent  with  the balance  sheet. Adjustments  to  move  from  an  accrual  to  cash basis, for purposes of the cash flow statement, are reflected in Corporate.\n\nCorporate includes certain operating and non-operating activities  that  are  not  reflected  in  the  operating  results  used internally  to  measure  and  evaluate  the  businesses,  as  well  as items to adjust  management  reporting  principles  to  U.S. GAAP. Operating activities in Corporate include the results of incidental businesses managed at the corporate level. Operating  elements  also  include  certain  employee  benefit costs, the costs of certain restructuring-type activities to maintain a competitive cost structure, including manufacturing and  workforce  optimization,  asset  impairment  charges  and other general Corporate items. The non-operating elements in Corporate  primarily  include  interest  expense,  certain  pension and other postretirement benefit costs, certain acquisition and divestiture  gains,  interest  and  investing  income  and  other financing costs.\n\nTotal  assets  for  the  reportable  segments  include  those  assets managed by the reportable segment, primarily inventory, fixed assets  and  intangible  assets.  Other  assets,  primarily  cash, accounts  receivable,  investment  securities  and  goodwill,  are included in Corporate.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Colgate increased advertising investment by $73 million company-wide, reaching $2,021 million, though it slightly declined as a percentage of net sales from 11.9% to 11.6%. However, the impact of this investment varied significantly across business units: in Hill's Pet Nutrition, advertising investment increased by 110 basis points as a percentage of net sales, contributing to a 30 basis point rise in Selling, general and administrative expenses, which pressured operating profit margins despite strong organic sales growth. Conversely, in Africa/Eurasia, advertising investment decreased by 140 basis points, contributing to a 60 basis point drop in SG&A expenses and supporting operating profit margin improvement, even though organic sales growth was more modest.

Organic sales in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 13.5% in 2021. Organic sales growth was led by the United States and Europe.\n\nThe increase in organic sales in 2021 versus 2020 was due to organic sales growth in the Science Diet and Prescription Diet categories.\n\nOperating profit in Hill's Pet Nutrition increased 14% in 2021 to $901, while as a percentage of Net sales it decreased 30 bps to 27.2%. This decrease in Operating profit as a percentage of Net sales was due to a decrease in Gross profit (40 bps) and an increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses (30 bps), partially offset by a decrease in Other (income) expense, net (40 bps), all as a percentage of Net sales. This decrease in Gross profit was primarily due to higher raw and packaging material costs (300 bps), partially offset by higher pricing and cost savings from the Company's funding-the-growth initiatives (100 bps). This increase in Selling, general and administrative expenses was due to increased advertising investment (110 bps), partially offset by lower overhead expenses (80 bps). This decrease in Other (income) expense, net was primarily due to the portion of costs incurred in 2020 in connection with the voluntary recall of selected canned dog food products due to potentially elevated levels of Vitamin D resulting from a supplier error for which Hill's was not indemnified.",

Segment Information\n\nThe Company operates in two product segments: Oral, Personal and Home Care; and Pet Nutrition.\n\nThe operations of the Oral, Personal and Home Care product segment are managed geographically in five reportable operating segments: North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific and Africa/Eurasia.\n\nThe Company evaluates segment performance based on several factors, including Operating profit. The Company uses Operating profit as a measure of operating segment performance because it excludes the impact of Corporate-driven decisions related to interest expense and income taxes.\n\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are generally the same as those described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Intercompany sales have been eliminated. Corporate operations include costs related to stock options and restricted stock units, research and development costs, Corporate overhead costs, restructuring and related implementation charges and gains and losses on sales of non-core product lines and assets. The Company reports these items within Corporate operations as they relate to Corporate-based responsibilities and decisions and are not included in the internal measures of segment operating performance used by the Company to measure the underlying performance of the operating segments.\n\nApproximately 70% of the Company's Net sales are generated from markets outside the U.S., with approximately 45% of the Company's Net sales coming from emerging markets (which consist of Latin America, Asia (excluding Japan), Africa/Eurasia and Central Europe). Oral, Personal and Home Care sales to Walmart, Inc. and its affiliates represent approximately 12%, 12% and 11% of the Company's Net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No other customer represented more than 10% of Net sales in any period presented.\n\nIn 2021, Corporate Operating profit included goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairment charges of $571, and a benefit of $26 related to a value-added tax matter in Brazil. In 2020, Corporate Operating profit included benefits of $16 resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program and a charge of $6 for acquisition-related costs. In 2019, Corporate Operating profit included charges of $125 resulting from the Global Growth and Efficiency Program, a charge of $24 for acquisition-related costs and a benefit of $30 from a value-added tax matter in Brazil.\n\n98\n\n",

(2)\n\nFor further discussion, see Note 6 and Note 7. Financial Instruments to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8.\n\n- Loss on Early Extinguishment of Debt: During 2021, Altria recorded pre-tax losses of $649 million as a result of the completed debt tender offers and redemption of certain long-term senior unsecured notes. For further discussion, see Note 9. LongTerm Debt to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 ('Note 9').\n- COVID-19 Special Items: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Altria recorded net pre-tax charges totaling $50 million directly related to disruptions caused by or efforts to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. For further discussion and a breakdown of these costs by segment, see Note 15.\n- Tax Items: For the year ended December 31, 2020, Altria recorded net tax expense of $50 million, due primarily to net tax expense of $27 million for adjustments resulting from amended returns and audit adjustments related to prior years, and tax expense of $23 million for a tax basis adjustment to Altria's investment in ABI.\n\n## 2021 Compared with 2020\n\nNet revenues, which include excise taxes billed to customers, decreased $140 million (0.5%), due primarily to lower net revenues in the smokeable products and wine segments (resulting from the sale of the wine business in October 2021), partially offset by higher net revenues in the financial services business (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual values of certain assets at PMCC in 2020) and the oral tobacco products segment.\n\nCost of sales decreased $699 million (8.9%), due primarily to changes in the wine segment, which included the inventory-related charges in 2020 (as discussed in Note 15) and the sale of the wine business in October 2021, lower shipment volume in the smokeable products segment, NPM Adjustment Items in 2021 and COVID-19 special items in 2020, partially offset by higher per unit settlement charges, higher manufacturing costs and volume and mix in the oral tobacco products segment.\n\nExcise taxes on products decreased $410 million (7.7%), due primarily to lower shipment volume in the smokeable products segment.\n\nMarketing, administration and research costs increased $278 million (12.9%), due primarily to higher general corporate expenses (including an agreement to resolve a shareholder class action lawsuit in 2021 as discussed in Note 18), higher spending in the oral tobacco products (including higher acquisition-related costs as discussed in Note 15) and smokeable products segments and higher spending associated with the retail expansion of IQOS and Marlboro HeatSticks.\n\nOperating income increased $687 million (6.3%), due primarily to higher operating results in the smokeable products and wine segments and the all other category (primarily driven by reductions in the estimated residual value of certain assets at PMCC in 2020), partially offset by higher general corporate expenses and lower operating results in the oral tobacco products segment.",

For a breakdown of asset impairment, exit and implementation costs by segment, see Note 5. Asset Impairment, Exit and Implementation Costs.\n\nIn addition, in 2021 the comparability of OCI was further impacted by the following disposition and acquisition-related costs:\n\nSte. Michelle Transaction: For the year ended December 31, 2021, net pre-tax disposition-related costs of $51 million were recorded in the wine segment, which consisted of a net pre-tax charge of $41 million to record the assets and liabilities associated with the Ste. Michelle Transaction at their fair value less costs to sell and $10 million of other disposition-related costs. The total net pre-tax charges of $51 million were recorded in marketing, administration and research costs in Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\nAcquisition-Related Costs : For the year ended December 31, 2021, Altria recorded pre-tax acquisition-related costs of $37 million in the oral tobacco products segment primarily for the settlement of an arbitration related to the 2019 on! transaction. These costs were included in marketing, administration and research costs in Altria's consolidated statements of earnings (losses).\n\n- PMCC Residual Value Adjustments: For the year ended December 31, 2020, PMCC recorded pre-tax charges of $125 million (as a reduction to net revenues in the all other category) related to the decrease in unguaranteed residual values of certain leased assets. There were no such adjustments in 2021 or 2019.\n\n## Note 16. Benefit Plans\n\nSubsidiaries of Altria sponsor noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain employees of Altria and its subsidiaries. Employees hired on or after a date specific to their employee group, except for certain employees of UST's subsidiaries and Middleton, are not eligible to participate in these noncontributory defined benefit pension plans but are instead eligible to participate in a defined contribution plan with enhanced benefits. Altria and its subsidiaries also provide postretirement health care and other benefits to certain retired employees.\n\nThe plan assets and benefit obligations of Altria's pension plans and postretirement plans are measured at December 31 of each year.\n\nThe discount rates for Altria's plans were based on a yield curve developed from a model portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds with durations that match the expected future cash flows of the pension and postretirement benefit obligations.",

      "answer": "In 2021, Cronos-related special items had a significant negative impact on Altria's equity investment performance and contributed to earnings volatility, with a total expense of $466 million, compared to a much smaller $51 million in 2020. Specifically, the 2021 impact was driven by a $148 million loss on Cronos-related financial instruments and $318 million in losses from equity investments, as disclosed in the detailed Cronos-specific breakdown. This contrasted sharply with 2020, where the Cronos-related impact was minimal. Additionally, in the consolidated earnings table, Cronos-related special items contributed directly to a $470 million net earnings (losses) attributable to Altria in 2021, further highlighting its role in the year-over-year earnings decline and volatility.",

For further discussion, see Note 16.\n\n(Income) losses from equity investments, which decreased $5,868 million (100.0%+), were negatively impacted by higher losses from Altria's equity investment in ABI (primarily due to the non-cash impairment of Altria's equity investment in ABI in 2021 discussed above), unfavorable Cronos special items (as discussed above) and a non-cash, unrealized gain resulting from an increase in the estimated fair value of Altria's investment in JUUL in 2020.\n\nReported net earnings (losses) attributable to Altria of $2,475 million decreased $1,992 million (44.6%), due primarily to higher net losses from Altria's equity investments and the loss on early extinguishment of debt, partially offset by the 2020 impairment of JUUL equity securities, higher operating income and favorable net periodic benefit income, excluding service cost.

These challenges, some of which are discussed in more detail in Note 18, Item 1A and Item 3, include:\n\n- pending and threatened litigation and bonding requirements;\n- restrictions and requirements imposed by the FSPTCA, and restrictions and requirements (and related enforcement actions) that have been, and in the future will be, imposed by the FDA;\n- actual and proposed excise tax increases, as well as changes in tax structures and tax stamping requirements;\n- bans and restrictions on tobacco use imposed by governmental entities and private establishments and employers;\n- other federal, state and local government actions, including:\n- restrictions on the sale of certain tobacco products, the sale of tobacco products by certain retail establishments, the sale of tobacco products with characterizing flavors and the sale of tobacco products in certain package sizes;\n- additional restrictions on the advertising and promotion of tobacco products;\n- other actual and proposed tobacco-related legislation and regulation; and\n- governmental investigations;\n- reductions in cigarette and MST consumption levels due to growth of innovative tobacco products;\n- increased efforts by tobacco control advocates and other private sector entities (including retail establishments) to further restrict the availability and use of tobacco products;\n- changes in adult tobacco consumer purchase behavior, which is influenced by various factors such as economic conditions (including inflation), excise taxes and price gap relationships, may result in adult tobacco consumers switching to discount products or other lower-priced tobacco products;\n- the highly competitive nature of all tobacco categories, including competitive disadvantages related to cigarette price increases attributable to the settlement of certain litigation and the proliferation of innovative tobacco products, such as e-vapor and oral nicotine pouch products;\n- illicit trade in tobacco products;\n- potential adverse changes in prices, availability and quality of tobacco, other raw materials and component parts; and\n- the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nIn addition to and in connection with the foregoing, evolving adult tobacco consumer preferences are continuing to impact the tobacco industry.

      "answer": "Altria's investment in Cronos is treated differently across its financial statements, tax disclosures, and investment accounting policies. In the financial statements (page 68), the carrying value of the Cronos investment was $335 million in 2023, down from $375 million in 2022, indicating a decline in value. In the investment accounting section (page 69), Altria disclosed that the fair value of its Cronos investment was $8 million below carrying value at the end of 2023, and no impairment was recorded as the decline was deemed temporary. However, in 2022 and 2021, Altria recorded non-cash impairment charges of $107 million and $205 million, respectively, due to other-than-temporary declines. In the tax disclosures (page 80), Altria reported a $128 million net tax expense related to its Cronos investment in 2021, including a valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset. This reflects the tax impact of the investment's volatility and impairment charges, showing how the investment affects Altria's financials both directly and through tax adjustments.",

      "question": "How does Altria's accounting treatment of its investment in ABI across impairment charges, fair value reporting, and tax disclosures reflect its financial strategy and risk exposure?",
      "answer": "Altria's financial treatment of its investment in ABI reveals a complex strategy with significant risk exposure. In 2022, Altria recorded a $2.5 billion non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge due to a decline in the fair value of its ABI investment, indicating a recognition of deteriorating market conditions or underperformance relative to expectations. Despite this, the fair value of Altria's investment in ABI at the end of 2023 was $12.7 billion, exceeding its carrying value of $9.7 billion by 32%, suggesting a rebound in ABI's market valuation and potential upside in Altria's long-term strategy. However, Altria's tax disclosures show a $306 million tax expense in 2022 related to decreases in the estimated fair value of the ABI investment, highlighting the volatility in tax provisions tied to ABI's performance. This combination of impairment losses, fluctuating fair value, and tax implications reflects a high-risk exposure to ABI's market position, while the equity method accounting and lagged reporting underscore the strategic but indirect control Altria maintains over this significant investment.",

      "question": "Given Altria's ongoing tobacco litigation liabilities and settlement obligations, how have NPM Adjustments under the Master Settlement Agreement specifically impacted their 2023 operating performance and remaining litigation exposure?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NPM Adjustments under the Master Settlement Agreement reduced Altria's Operating Companies Income (OCI) by $29 million, as shown in the operating results. These adjustments arise from resolutions of disputes with states and territories related to the NPM adjustment provision, which were recorded as reductions to cost of sales and impacted OCI in the smokeable products segment. Over the years 2021 to 2023, Altria paid approximately $3.7 billion annually toward the State Settlement Agreements, which included provisions for NPM Adjustments. This indicates that while the direct financial impact of NPM Adjustments in 2023 was relatively modest at $29 million, they remain a component of Altria\u2019s broader litigation-related financial obligations and influence the company's operating performance.",

      "question": "How does Target's treatment of Vendor Income Receivable in financial reporting align with the audit scrutiny it undergoes and the sensitivity of its cost of sales to inventory and shrink adjustments?",
      "answer": "Target records Vendor Income Receivable as a reduction of Cost of Sales, forecasting collections and estimating amounts earned, with a balance of $543 million as of February 1, 2025. This receivable is a material component of cost of sales and is based on historical trends and forecasts. The audit process, conducted by Ernst & Young LLP, focuses heavily on the accuracy and completeness of the inputs used in estimating the receivable, including sensitivity analyses and recalculations of earned income. Given that a 10% change in the inventory shrink reserve could impact cost of sales by $150 million, and vendor income itself reduces cost of sales, the integrity of the Vendor Income Receivable estimate is critical to the accuracy of reported margins. Thus, the audit scrutiny ensures that the assumptions used in the Vendor Income Receivable align with the financial reporting and mitigate risks to cost of sales volatility.",

As discussed in N ote 4 of the consolidated financial statem ents, the Corporation receives consideration for a variety of vendor-sponsored program s, which are prim arily recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when earned. The Corporation records a receivable for am ounts earned but not yet received.\n\nAuditing the C orporation's calculation of vendor incom e receivable was especially challenging due to the inputs required in the vendor receivable m odel, which include, am ong others, forecasted vendor incom e collections and the tim e period over which the collections have been earned. As a result of the high volum e of transactions processed by the C orporation and used in estim ating these inputs, auditing the vendor incom e receivable requires extensive audit effort to address the com pleteness and accuracy of the inform ation used in the receivable m odel.\n\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the C orporation's vendor incom e receivable process, including controls over the inputs described above.\n\nT o test the estim ated vendor incom e receivable, we perform ed audit procedures that included, am ong others, testing the com pleteness and accuracy of inputs used in the receivable m odel by verifying for a sam ple of the vendor-sponsored program s, the nature and source of the inputs used and the term s of the contractual agreem ents. W e recalculated the am ount of the vendor incom e earned based on the inputs and the term s of the contractual agreem ents. I n addition, we recalculated the tim e period over which the vendor incom e collections had been earned to assess the accuracy of m anagem ent's inputs used in the m odel. We also perform ed sensitivity analyses of inputs to evaluate the significance of changes in the receivable that would result from  changes to the inputs. F inally, we perform ed audit procedures over the vendor incom e collections subsequent to the balance sheet date to support the vendor incom e receivable at year end.\n\n## /s/ E rnst &amp; Young LLP\n\nWe have served as the C orporation's auditor since 1931.\n\nMinneapolis, M innesota March 12, 2025\n\nTA RGET CORPORA TION\n\n2024 Form 10-K",

Our inv entory is v alued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. We reduce inv entory for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. Our shrink estimate is based on historical losses and is adjusted to reflect results of actual physical inv entory counts. We generally perform counts at each location annually, with counts taking place throughout the year. A 10 percent increase or decrease in our 2024 year-end inv entory shrink reserv e would impact our cost of sales by approximately $150 million. Historically, our actual physical inv entory count results hav e shown our estimates to be reasonably accurate. Market adjustments for markdowns are recorded when the salability of the merchandise has diminished. Salability can be impacted by consumer preferences and seasonality, among other factors. We believ e the risk of inv entory obsolescence is largely mitigated because our inv entory typically turns in less than three months. Inv entory was $12.7 billion and $1 1.9 billion as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely, and is further described in Note 8 to the Financial Statements.\n\nVendor income: We receiv e v arious forms of consideration from our v endors (v endor income), principally earned as a result of v olume rebates, promotions, advertising allowances, and markdown allowances. Vendor income is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales except in arrangements where the payment is a reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs and recorded as an offset to those costs.  Vendor income earned can v ary based on a number of factors, including purchase v olumes, sales v olumes, and our pricing and promotion strategies.\n\nWe establish a receiv able for v endor income that is earned but not yet receiv ed. Based on historical trending and data, this receiv able is computed by forecasting v endor income collections and estimating the amount earned. The majority of the year-end v endor income receiv ables are collected within the following  fiscal  quarter ,  and  we  do  not  believ e  there  is  a  reasonable  likelihood  that  the  assumptions  used  in  our  estimate  will  change  significantly. Historically,  adjustments  to  our  v endor  income  receiv able  hav e  not  been  material.  Vendor  income  receiv able  was  $543  million  and  $513  million  as  of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely. Vendor income is described further in Note 4 to the Financial Statements.\n\nLong-lived assets: Long-liv ed assets are rev iewed for impairment whenev er ev ents or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recov erable. T he ev aluation is performed primarily at the store lev el. An impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows from the operation and/or ev entual disposition of the asset or asset group are less than its carrying amount, and is measured as the excess of its carrying amount ov er fair v alue. We estimate fair v alue by obtaining market appraisals, obtaining v aluations from third-party brokers, or using other v aluation techniques. We recorded impairments of $68 million, $102 million, and $66 million in 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectiv ely, which are described further in Note 10 to the Financial Statements.\n\nInsurance/self-insurance: We retain a substantial portion of the risk related to certain general liability, workers' compensation, property loss, and team member medical and dental claims. However, we maintain stop-loss cov erage to limit the exposure related to certain risks. Liabilities associated with these losses include estimates of both claims filed and losses incurred but not yet reported. We use actuarial methods which consider a number of factors to estimate our ultimate cost of losses. General liability and workers' compensation liabilities are recorded based on our estimate of their net present v alue; other  liabilities  referred  to  abov e  are  not  discounted.  Our  workers'  compensation  and  general  liability  accrual  was  $772  million  and  $650  million  as  of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely. We believ e that the amounts accrued are appropriate; howev er, our liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences or loss dev elopments differ from our assumptions. For example, a 10 percent increase or decrease in av erage claim costs would have impacted our self-insurance expense by $77 million in 2024. Historically, adjustments to our estimates hav e not been material. Refer to Part II, Item  7A,  Quantitativ e  and  Qualitativ e  Disclosures About  Market  Risk,  for  further  disclosure  of  the  market  risks  associated  with  these  exposures.

Inv entory is stated at the lower of LIFO cost or market. Inv entory cost includes the amount we pay to our suppliers to acquire inv entory, freight costs incurred to deliv er product to our distribution centers and stores, and import costs, reduced by v endor income and cash discounts. Supply chain operating costs, including compensation and benefits, are expensed in the period incurred. Inv entory is also reduced for estimated losses related to shrink and markdowns. The LIFO prov ision is calculated based on inv entory lev els, markup rates, and internally measured retail price indices, and was $183 million and $153 million as of February 1, 2025, and February 3, 2024, respectiv ely.\n\nUnder RIM, inv entory cost and the resulting gross margins are calculated by applying a cost-to-retail ratio to the inv entory retail v alue. RIM is an av eraging method that has been widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality. T he use of RIM will result in inv entory being v alued at the lower of cost or market because permanent markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail v alue of inv entory.",

T he principal forwardlooking statements in this report include statements regarding: our future financial and operational performance, our strategy for growth, the adequacy of and costs associated with our sources of liquidity, the funding of debt maturities, the execution of our share repurchase program, our expected capital expenditures and new lease commitments, the expected compliance with debt cov enants, the expected impact of new accounting pronouncements, our intentions  regarding  future  div idends,  the  expected  contributions  and  payments  related  to  our  pension  plan,  the  expected  return  on  plan  assets,  the expected timing and recognition of compensation expenses, the adequacy of our reserv es for general liability, workers' compensation, and property loss, the expected outcome of, and adequacy of our reserv es for, claims, litigation, and the resolution of tax matters, our expectations regarding our contractual obligations,  liabilities,  and  v endor  income,  the  expected  ability  to  recognize  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  and  the  timing  of  such  recognition,  our expectations regarding arrangements with our partners, and changes in our assumptions and expectations.\n\nAll such forward-looking statements are intended to enjoy the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Priv ate Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, as amended. Although we believ e there is a reasonable basis for the forward-looking statements, our actual results could be materially  different.  T he  most  important  factors  which  could  cause  our  actual  results  to  differ  from  our  forward-looking  statements  are  set  forth  in  our description  of  risk  factors  included  in Part  I,  Item  1A,  Risk  Factors  to  this  Form  10-K,  which  should  be  read  in  conjunction  with  the  forward-looking statements in this report. Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we do not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statement.\n\n## Item 7A.    Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nAs of  February 1, 2025, our exposure to market risk was primarily from interest rate changes on our debt obligations and short-term inv estments.  Our interest rate exposure is primarily due to differences between our floating rate debt obligations, including fixed rate debt hedged using floating rate interest rate swaps, compared to our floating rate short-term inv estments. As of February 1, 2025, our floating rate short-term inv estments exceeded our floating rate debt obligations by approximately $1.7 billion. Based on our financial position as of February 1, 2025, the annualized effect of a 1 percentage point increase in  floating  interest  rates  on  our  floating  rate  short-term inv estments, net of our floating rate debt obligations, would increase our earnings before income taxes by $17 million. In general, we expect our floating rate debt obligations to be in line with our floating rate short-term inv estments ov er time, but that may vary in different interest rate and economic env ironments.  See further description of our debt and deriv ativ e instruments in  Notes 15  and 16  to  the Financial Statements.\n\nWe record our general liability and workers' compensation liabilities at net present v alue; therefore, these liabilities fluctuate with changes in interest rates. Based on our balance sheet position as of  February 1, 2025, the annualized effect of a 1 percentage point increase/(decrease) in interest rates would increase/(decrease) earnings before income taxes by $17 million.\n\nIn addition, we are exposed to market return fluctuations on our qualified defined benefit pension plan. T he v alue of our pension liabilities is inv ersely related to changes in interest rates. A 1 percentage point decrease in the weighted av erage discount rate would increase annual expense by $33 million. T o protect against declines in interest rates, we hold high-quality, long-duration bonds and deriv ativ e instruments in our pension plan trust. As of February 1, 2025, we had hedged 70 percent of the interest rate exposure of our plan liabilities.\n\nAs  more  fully  described  in Note  22  to  the  Financial  Statements,  we  are  exposed  to  market  returns  on  accumulated  team  member  balances  in  our nonqualified, unfunded deferred compensation plans. We control the risk of offering the nonqualified plans by making inv estments in life insurance contracts and prepaid forward contracts on our own common stock that substantially offset our economic exposure to the returns on these plans.\n\nThere hav e been no other material changes in our primary risk exposures or management of market risks since the prior year.\n\n2024 Form 10-K",

Note 2 to the Financial Statements prov ides more information.\n\nMerchandise Sales are net of expected returns, and our estimate of gift card breakage. Note 2 to the Financial Statements defines gift card \"breakage.\" We use comparable sales to ev aluate the performance of our stores and digital channels by measuring the change in sales for a period ov er the comparable, prior-year period of equiv alent length. Comparable sales include all Merchandise Sales, except sales from stores open less than 13 months or that hav e been closed. Comparable sales measures vary across the retail industry. As a result, our comparable sales calculation is not necessarily comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Digitally originated sales include all Merchandise Sales initiated through mobile applications and our websites. Our stores fulfill the majority of digitally originated sales, including shipment from stores to guests, store Order Pickup or Driv e Up, and Same Day Deliv ery. Digitally originated sales may also be fulfilled through our distribution centers, our v endors, or other third parties.\n\nMerchandise Sales growth - from both comparable sales and new stores - represents an important driv er of our long-term profitability.

The following risks, some of which hav e occurred and any of which may occur in the future, could materially and adversely  affect  our  business  and  financial  performance.  T hese  are  not  the  only  risks  we  face  and  there  may  be  other  risks  that  could  materially  and adversely affect our business and financial performance. Although the risks are organized by headings, and each risk is discussed separately, many are interrelated.\n\n## Competitive and Reputational Risks\n\nIf  we  are  unable  to  positively  differentiate  ours elves   from  our  competitors ,  our  res ults   of  operations   and  financial  condition  could  be adversely affected.\n\nWe attempt to differentiate our guest experience through a careful combination of price, merchandise assortment, store env ironment, conv enience, guest serv ice,  loyalty  programs,  adv ertising,  and  marketing.  Our  ability  to  successfully  differentiate  ourselv es  depends  on  many  competitiv e  factors,  including guest  perceptions  regarding  our  shopping  experience,  the  safety  and  cleanliness  of  our  stores,  our  ability  to  offer  products  at  affordable  prices,  the desirability  and  exclusiv ity  of  our  offerings,  our  in-stock  lev els,  the  effectiv eness  of  our  digital  channels  and  fulfillment  options,  our  ability  to  responsibly source merchandise, and our ability to create a personalized guest experience. If we fail to differentiate our guest experience from our competitors, our results of operations and financial condition could be adv ersely affected.\n\nConsumers  continue  to  migrate  to  digital  channels  and  seek  out  multiple  fulfillment  options,  which  has  affected  the  ways  we  attempt  to  differentiate ourselv es. Since consumers can quickly comparison shop using digital tools, they may make decisions based solely on price or conv enience, which could limit our ability to differentiate from our competitors. In addition, prov iding multiple fulfillment options, expanding our digital channels, and implementing new technology is complex, costly, and may not meet our guests' expectations. If we are unable to offset our inv estments in these or other initiativ es with improved  performance  or  efficiencies,  our  results  of  operations  could  be  adv ersely  affected.  In  addition,  if  we  do  not  anticipate  and  adapt  to  consumer behavior or dev elopments and offerings by our competitors, we may not be able to compete effectiv ely. For example, we may be unable to match or surpass the adv ances in technologies and capabilities (including artificial intelligence) that our competitors implement for consumer-facing platforms or for internal operations, which could adv ersely affect our competitiv e position. Furthermore, generativ e artificial intelligence presents emerging ethical issues and could negativ ely  impact  our  guests  and  team members.  If our use of generativ e artificial intelligence becomes controv ersial or is inaccurate or ineffectiv e, our reputation  and  competitiv e  position  could  be  adv ersely  affected.  Consumers  may  also  use  third-party  channels,  dev ices,  technologies,  and  capabilities (including artificial intelligence) to initiate shopping searches and place orders, which could make us dependent on the capabilities and search algorithms of those third parties to reach those consumers. Any failures or difficulties in executing our differentiation efforts or adapting to offerings by our competitors could adv ersely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\n\nIf  we do not anticipate consumer demand and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\n\nA large part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend-right decisions in a broad range of merchandise categories and offer those products at affordable prices. If we do not accurately predict consumer demand and quickly respond to changing consumer preferences and spending patterns, we may experience  lower  sales,  spoilage,  and  increased  inv entory  markdowns,  which  could  adv ersely  affect  our  results  of  operations.  Our  ability  to  accurately predict consumer demand and adapt to changing consumer preferences depends on many factors, including obtaining accurate and relev ant data on guest preferences, successfully implementing new technologies and capabilities (including artificial intelligence), emphasizing relev ant merchandise categories, effectiv ely managing our inv entory lev els, and implementing competitiv e and effectiv e pricing and promotion strategies. We hav e not always been able to accurately predict consumer demand or rapid changes in consumer preferences and spending patterns, which has prev iously resulted in insufficient or excess inventory, increased inv entory markdowns, higher costs (including for storage, transportation, labor, and other expenses), and adv erse impacts on our results of operations. If we are unable to accurately predict consumer demand and effectiv ely adapt to future changes in consumer preferences and spending patterns, our results of operations and financial condition could be adv ersely affected.\n\n2024 Form 10-K",
