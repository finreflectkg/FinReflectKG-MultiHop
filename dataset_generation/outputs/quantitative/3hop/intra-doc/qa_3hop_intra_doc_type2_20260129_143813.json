      "question": "How do NextEra Energy's income statement, cash flow statement, and segment reporting collectively reflect the impact of gains on disposal of businesses/assets in 2021, particularly in terms of net income, operating cash flow, and segment-level contributions?",
      "answer": "In 2021, NextEra Energy reported net gains on disposal of businesses/assets at $77 million in its consolidated segment reporting (page 112), which contributed to a $3,206 million net income (page 65). However, in the cash flow statement (page 67), the company adjusted net income downward by $1 million for gains on disposal, indicating that while the gains positively impacted net income, they were non-operating in nature and excluded from operating cash flow. This reflects a nuanced treatment where disposal gains boosted reported earnings but were neutralized in cash flow from operations, highlighting the distinction between earnings quality and cash generation.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [NEE](page_112) \u2192 [Disposal Gains]: In 2021, NEE reported $77 million in net gains on disposal of businesses/assets at the consolidated level, with $1 million from FPL and $78 million from NEER.",
        "Hop 2: [NEE](page_67) \u2192 [Disposal Gains]: The 2021 cash flow statement shows a $1 million adjustment to net income for gains on disposal, indicating the exclusion of these gains from operating cash flows.",
        "Hop 3: [NEE](page_65) \u2192 [Disposal Gains]: The 2021 income statement shows $1 million in gains on disposal, aligning with the segment-level contribution from FPL and directly contributing to the $3,206 million net income."

      "answer": "NEE's current other assets include $567 million in investments accounted for under the equity method and loans not measured at fair value (Level 2 and Level 3 assets), $34 million in restricted cash equivalents, and $73 million in margin cash collateral paid to counterparties that is not offset against derivative assets or liabilities. These assets are treated differently depending on their classification: fair value investments in nuclear decommissioning funds flow through income or OCI based on regulatory status, while margin collateral impacts balance sheet presentation under master netting arrangements. This mix reflects both operational liquidity needs and regulatory accounting treatments.",

      "question": "How does the pattern of long-term debt retirements in 2023 compare across different financial reporting segments, and what does this reveal about NEE\u2019s capital structure management and financing priorities?",
      "answer": "In 2023, NEE's consolidated cash flow statement (page 42) shows total long-term debt retirements of $7,978 million. This aligns with the financing activities section (page 63), which also reports $7,978 million in retirements, confirming consistency in the reported figure. However, the Florida Power & Light Company (FPL) segment (page 67) only accounts for $1,548 million in long-term debt retirements, suggesting that the majority of the retirements occurred outside of the FPL segment, likely within the NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) segment or corporate-level financing activities. This disparity indicates that capital structure management and debt reduction efforts were more pronounced at the corporate or non-regulated segments, pointing to a strategic focus on optimizing financing at the broader NEE level rather than within the regulated utility segment (FPL).",

      "question": "How does NextEra Energy Resources' asset divestiture activity in 2021, as reflected in NEE's consolidated financial statements, align with the capital structure assumptions and interest expense allocations applied to the same entity in NEE's segment reporting?",
      "answer": "NextEra Energy Resources (NEER) divested multiple wind and solar facilities in 2021, generating $1.7 billion and $563 million in separate transactions, which resulted in a $53 million loss and a $94 million gain, respectively. These transactions are detailed in NEE's consolidated financial statements. In the segment reporting, NEER's subsidiaries are shown to have interest expense allocated based on a deemed capital structure of 70% debt, which also applies to the differential membership interests sold during these asset disposals. This suggests that the capital structure assumptions used in segment reporting directly influence the financial impact of NEER's divestiture strategy, tying operational decisions to broader corporate financing frameworks.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy's rate increase applications across multiple jurisdictions and years show varying outcomes in ROE, capital structure, and coal ash cost recovery. In the 2017 North Carolina rate case, Duke Energy Carolinas secured an ROE of 9.9% with a 52% equity/48% debt capital structure, while the 2019 case resulted in a slightly lower ROE of 9.6% with the same capital structure. In contrast, Duke Energy Progress' 2018 South Carolina case allowed for an ROE of 9.5% with a 53% equity/47% debt structure. Regarding coal ash costs, Duke Energy Carolinas was allowed to recover $125 million in South Carolina and received favorable rulings in North Carolina, including a return on unamortized balances. However, Duke Energy Progress was denied recovery of $65 million in coal ash costs in South Carolina. In the 2021 North Carolina rate case for Piedmont, the ROE was set at 9.6% with a capital structure of 51.6% equity and 48.4% debt, and infrastructure investments not covered under the IMR mechanism were included in rate base, showing a continued emphasis on capital investment recovery.",

          "chunk_text": "## 2017 North Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn August 25, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $647 million. On February 28, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement resolving certain portions of the proceeding. Terms of the settlement included an ROE of 9.9% and a capital structure of 52% equity and 48% debt. On June 22, 2018, the NCUC issued an order approving the Stipulation of Partial Settlement and requiring a revenue reduction.\n\nThe North Carolina Attorney General and other parties separately filed Notices of Appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court. The North Carolina Supreme Court consolidated the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress appeals. On December 11, 2020, the North Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion, which affirmed, in part, and reversed and remanded, in part, the NCUC's decisions. In the Opinion, the court upheld the NCUC's decision to include coal ash costs in the cost of service, as well as the NCUC's discretion to allow a return on the unamortized balance of coal ash costs. The court also remanded to the NCUC a single issue to consider the assessment of support for the Public Staff's equitable sharing argument. On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021, and approved by the NCUC on March 31, 2021. The NCUC issued an Order on Remand Accepting CCR Settlement and Affirming Previous Orders Setting Rates and Imposing Penalties on June 25, 2021.\n\n## 2019 North Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn September 30, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for a net rate increase for retail customers of approximately $291 million, which represented an approximate 6% increase in annual base revenues. The gross rate case revenue increase request was $445 million, which was offset by an EDIT rider of $154 million to return to customers North Carolina and federal EDIT resulting from recent reductions in corporate tax rates. The request for a rate increase was driven by major capital investments subsequent to the previous base rate case, coal ash pond closure costs, accelerated coal plant depreciation and deferred 2018 storm costs. Duke Energy Carolinas requested rates be effective no later than August 1, 2020.\n\nOn March 25, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain issues in the base rate proceeding. On July 24, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its request for approval of its notice to customers required to implement temporary rates. On July 27, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a joint motion with Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff notifying the commission that the parties reached a joint partial settlement with the Public Staff. Also, on July 27, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a letter stating that it intended to update its temporary rates calculation to reflect the terms of the partial settlement. On July 31, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed a Second Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Second Partial Settlement), subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain remaining issues in the base rate proceeding. The remaining items litigated at hearing included recovery of deferred coal ash compliance costs that are subject to asset retirement obligation accounting, implementation of new depreciation rates and the amortization period of the loss on the hydro station sale.\n\nOn August 4, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an amended motion for approval of its amended notice to customers, seeking to exercise its statutory right to implement temporary rates subject to refund on or after August 24, 2020. The revenue requirement to be recovered, subject to refund, through the temporary rates was based on and consistent with the base rate component of the Second Partial Settlement and excluded the items to be litigated noted above. The NCUC approved the August 4, 2020 amended temporary rates motion on August 6, 2020, and temporary rates went into effect on August 24, 2020.\n\nThe Duke Energy Carolinas evidentiary hearing concluded on September 18, 2020, and post-hearing filings were made with the NCUC from all parties by November 4, 2020. On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021.\n\nOn March 31, 2021, the NCUC issued an order approving the March 25, 2020, and July 31, 2020, partial settlements. The order includes approval of 1) an ROE of 9.6% based upon a capital structure of 52% equity and 48% debt; 2) deferral treatment of approximately $800 million of grid improvement projects with a return; 3) a flow back period of five years for unprotected federal EDIT; and 4) the reasonableness and prudence of $213 million of deferred storm costs, which were removed from the rate case and for which Duke Energy Carolinas filed a petition seeking securitization in October 2020. Additionally, the order approved without modification the CCR Settlement Agreement.\n\nThe order denied Duke Energy Carolinas' proposal to shorten the remaining depreciable lives of certain Duke Energy Carolinas coal-fired generating units, indicating the NCUC has not had the chance to fully examine the issue within the context of an integrated resource planning (IRP) proceeding, and upon retirement the remaining net book value of these units should be placed in a regulatory asset account to be amortized over an appropriate period to be determined in a future rate case.\n\nOn May 21, 2021, the NCUC issued an Order Approving Rate Schedules, which resulted in a net increase of approximately $33 million. Revised customer rates became effective on June 1, 2021.\n\n## 2018 South Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn November 8, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the PSCSC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $168 million.\n\nAfter hearings in March 2019, the PSCSC issued an order on May 21, 2019, which included an ROE of 9.5% and a capital structure of 53% equity and 47% debt. The order also included the following material components:\n\n- Approval of cancellation of the Lee Nuclear Project, with Duke Energy Carolinas maintaining the combined operating license;\n- Approval of recovery of $125 million (South Carolina retail portion) of Lee Nuclear Project development costs (including AFUDC through December 2017) over a 12-year period, but denial of a return on the deferred balance of costs;\n- Approval of recovery of $96 million of coal ash costs over a five-year period with a return at Duke Energy Carolinas' WACC;",

The gross rate case revenue increase request was $586 million, which was offset by riders of $122 million, primarily an EDIT rider of $120 million to return to customers North Carolina and federal EDIT resulting from recent reductions in corporate tax rates. The request for a rate increase was driven by major capital investments subsequent to the previous base rate case, coal ash pond closure costs, accelerated coal plant depreciation and deferred 2018 storm costs. Duke Energy Progress sought to defer and recover incremental Hurricane Dorian storm costs in this proceeding and requested rates be effective no later than September 1, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 24, 2020, the NCUC suspended the procedural schedule and postponed the previously scheduled evidentiary hearing on this matter indefinitely.\n\nOn June 2, 2020, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain issues in the base rate proceeding.

In addition, Duke Energy Progress also sought authorization to place a temporary decrement EDIT Rider into effect, concurrent with the temporary base rate change. The NCUC approved the August 7, 2020 temporary rates motion on August 11, 2020, and temporary rates went into effect on September 1, 2020.\n\nOn January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021.\n\nOn April 16, 2021, the NCUC issued an order approving the June 2, 2020, and July 31, 2020, partial settlements.

The rate increase is driven by significant infrastructure upgrade investments since Piedmont's previous rate case. Approximately half of the plant additions being added to rate base are categories of capital investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was approved in 2013. Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $26 million in December 2020. As authorized under Tennessee law, Piedmont implemented interim rates on January 2, 2021, at the level requested in its adjusted request. A settlement reached with the Tennessee Consumer Advocate in mid-January was approved by the TPUC on February 16, 2021. The settlement results in an increase of revenues of approximately $16 million and an ROE of 9.8%. Revised customer rates became effective on January 2, 2021. Piedmont refunded customers the difference between bills previously rendered under interim rates and such bills if rendered under approved rates, plus interest in April 2021.\n\n## 2021 North Carolina Rate Case\n\nOn March 22, 2021, Piedmont filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $109 million, which represents an approximate 10% increase in retail revenues. The rate increase is driven by customer growth and significant infrastructure upgrade investments (plant additions) since the last general rate case. Approximately 70% of the plant additions being rolled into rate base are categories of plant investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was originally approved as part of the 2013 North Carolina Rate Case. On July 28, 2021, Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $97 million.\n\nOn September 7, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff, the Carolina Utility Customers Association, Inc. and the Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates IV filed a Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Stipulation), which is subject to review and approval by the NCUC, resolving most issues between these parties. Major components of the Stipulation include:\n\n- A return on equity of 9.6% and a capital structure of 51.6% equity and 48.4% debt;\n- Continuation of the IMR mechanism and margin decoupling; and\n- A base rate increase of approximately $67 million, subject to completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project.\n\nAn evidentiary hearing to review the Stipulation and other issues concluded on September 9, 2021. On October 12, 2021, Piedmont notified the NCUC of its intent to implement the stipulated rates effective November 1, 2021, on a temporary basis and subject to refund. On October 18, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff filed supplemental testimony attesting to the completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project and to the propriety of including the capital investment for these two projects in this proceeding. On January 6, 2022, the NCUC issued an order approving the Stipulation. No refunds need to be rendered to customers arising from Piedmont's implementation of interim rates.\n\n## OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS\n\n## Atlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC\n\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP pipeline) was planned to be an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia to North Carolina. Duke Energy indirectly owns a 47% interest, which is accounted for as an equity method investment through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\n\nAs a result of the uncertainty created by various legal rulings, the potential impact on the cost and schedule for the project, the ongoing legal challenges and the risk of additional legal challenges and delays through the construction period and Dominion's decision to sell substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, Duke Energy's Board of Directors and management decided that it was not prudent to continue to invest in the project. On July 5, 2020, Duke Energy and Dominion announced the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project.\n\nAs part of the pretax charges to earnings of approximately $2.1 billion recorded in June 2020, within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates on the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, Duke Energy established liabilities related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately $855 million to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. At December 31, 2021, there is $47 million and $53 million within Other Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively, in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment. The liabilities represent Duke Energy's obligation of approximately $100 million to satisfy remaining ARO requirements to restore construction sites.\n\nSee Notes 7 and 12 for additional information regarding this transaction.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy's audit approach for the $949 million coal ash asset retirement obligation at Duke Energy Indiana involved significantly more specialized procedures and external expert involvement due to the high degree of estimation uncertainty. Unlike the standard evaluation of regulatory asset balances\u2014where auditors primarily perform inquiries, trend analyses, and comparisons to independently developed expectations\u2014the coal ash liability required additional scrutiny around probability weightings assigned to potential closure methods. This included testing controls over these estimates, consulting with legal counsel regarding pending challenges, and involving environmental specialists to assess closure method assumptions. These enhanced procedures reflect the increased complexity and judgment inherent in valuing uncertain future obligations without fully approved plans, compared to more routine regulatory asset assessments.",

These legal obligations are the result of Indiana state and federal regulations. There is significant judgment in determining the methods to close each site since Duke Energy Indiana does not have approved closure plans for certain sites. Management has applied probability weightings for the cash flows for certain sites based the likelihood of implementing potential closure methods. Probability weightings for the cash flows associated with the different potential closure methods ('probability weightings') creates estimation uncertainty. The liability for coal ash asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Indiana was $949 million at December 31, 2021.\n\nWe identified the asset retirement obligations associated with coal ash impoundments at Duke Energy Indiana as a critical audit matter because of the significant management estimates and assumptions, including the different potential closure methods and the probability weightings as a result of pending legal challenges. The audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management's estimates and assumptions related to the probability weightings for the cash flows associated with the different potential closure methods required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our environmental specialists.\n\n## How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\n\nOur audit procedures related to the probability weightings for the cash flows associated with the different potential closure methods for coal ash asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Indiana included the following, among others:\n\n- We tested the effectiveness of controls over management's coal ash asset retirement obligation estimate, including those over management's determination of the probability weightings.\n- We tested the mathematical accuracy of management's coal ash asset retirement obligation calculations, including the application of probability weightings.\n- We made inquiries of internal and external legal counsel regarding the status of the legal matters associated with the probability weightings.\n- We inspected the opinions from internal and external legal counsel supporting the probability weightings.\n- With the assistance of professionals in our firm with the appropriate expertise, we inspected the Company's filings with and orders from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, for evidence that might contradict management's assertions regarding the probability weightings.\n\n## /s/ Deloitte &amp; Touche LLP\n\nCharlotte, North Carolina February 24, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.",

      "question": "How has the Customer Connect Project evolved across different regulatory asset disclosures in Duke Energy's 2022 10-K, and what does this progression indicate about the company's investment strategy and regulatory treatment of this initiative?",
      "answer": "The Customer Connect Project shows increasing investment over time, with $25 million in 2020 growing to $57 million by 2021 in the primary regulatory asset table (page_149), reflecting a 128% increase. This follows a similar upward trend in another regulatory asset schedule showing the project rising from $50 million to $66 million between 2020 and 2021 (page_146). The project also appears significantly larger at $242 million in the consolidated regulatory asset table that includes both Duke Energy and Progress Energy historical data (page_142), suggesting it encompasses multiple business units and has been a multi-year initiative. The consistent 'Yes' designation for earning a return across these sections indicates favorable regulatory treatment despite the growing balance.",

      "question": "What explains the significant differences in the reported balances of Duke Energy's 'Deferred fuel and purchased power' regulatory asset between the 2020 and 2021 periods across different sections of the 10-K, where one section shows $158 million and $303 million, another shows $42 million and $339 million, and a third shows $213 million and $1,253 million?",
      "answer": "The differences in the 'Deferred fuel and purchased power' balances stem from varying levels of aggregation and reporting scope across the sections. On page 149, the $158 million (2020) and $303 million (2021) figures reflect a more consolidated but limited regulatory asset view focused on specific Duke Energy entities. On page 146, the $42 million (2020) and $339 million (2021) values appear to isolate a narrower segment or subsidiary, showing significant year-over-year volatility. On page 142, the $213 million (2020) and $1,253 million (2021) amounts suggest a broader consolidated presentation that includes both Duke Energy and Progress Energy, revealing a much larger total exposure. These variations indicate differing regulatory treatments, segment reporting scopes, and potential adjustments for rate recovery mechanisms across the company's filings.",

        "Hop 2: [DUK](page_146) \u2192 Deferred fuel and purchased power: Shows a much lower $42 million (2020) and $339 million (2021), suggesting a narrower segment or regulatory jurisdiction with distinct asset recognition.",

      "question": "How does the evolution of Member's Equity from 2018 to 2021, as shown in the standalone equity changes, reconcile with the broader equity composition including Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and the balance sheet presentation at year-end?",
      "answer": "From the standalone Member's Equity changes, the balance grew from $4,339 million in 2018 to $5,015 million in 2021, driven by net income of $436 million, $408 million, and $481 million over the three years, partially offset by distributions to the parent totaling $200 million, $200 million, and $250 million, respectively. In the broader equity section, Member's Equity increased from $6,097 million in 2018 to $8,298 million in 2021, with Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income remaining relatively small (ranging from a $2 million loss to a $1 million gain), indicating that net income was the primary driver of equity growth. On the balance sheet, Member's Equity is shown at $8,298 million in 2021, aligning with the broader equity composition table and confirming the cumulative effect of annual earnings and distributions. This consistent growth across all three perspectives reflects a stable capital structure with minimal volatility from comprehensive income adjustments.",

      "answer": "Duke Energy's total payments for the redemption of long-term debt across all reported financial segments in 2023 amounted to $398 million ($45 million in one segment, $500 million in another, and $303 million in the third). During the same period, the company received $1,617 million from the issuance of long-term debt (comprising $348 million, $774 million, and $495 million across the respective segments). This indicates that Duke Energy was a net issuer of long-term debt in 2023, with new issuances significantly exceeding redemptions.",

      "question": "How does the pattern of proceeds from sales and maturities of debt and equity securities across Duke Energy's consolidated cash flow statement, Duke Energy Carolinas' cash flow statement, and Duke Energy Progress' cash flow statement reflect differences in investment strategy and liquidity management across the three entities in 2023?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy reported $2,025 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of debt and equity securities in its consolidated cash flow statement, while Duke Energy Carolinas reported $55 million and Duke Energy Progress reported $1,663 million. These differences suggest that Duke Energy Progress was more actively managing its portfolio of debt and equity securities compared to Duke Energy Carolinas, which had minimal proceeds. The consolidated figure indicates that the overall liquidity strategy of Duke Energy is largely influenced by Duke Energy Progress, while Duke Energy Carolinas appears to maintain a more stable or smaller portfolio of such investments.",

      "answer": "The $193 million CEP deferral is listed in the regulatory assets table on page 139, showing it increased from $190 million in 2022 to $193 million in 2023. On page 149, the CEP deferral is explicitly noted as an asset that 'earns a return,' indicating its active role in Duke Energy's cost recovery mechanisms. Page 140 clarifies that the CEP deferral represents deferred depreciation, post-in-service carrying costs (PISCC), and deferred property tax for Duke Energy Ohio Gas capital assets under the Capital Efficiency Plan (CEP). Together, these perspectives show that the CEP deferral is a structured regulatory mechanism that accumulates specific deferred costs and is expected to generate returns through rate recovery, aligning financial treatment with operational and tax deferrals.",

      "question": "How does NEE's exposure to retrospective assessments under the Price-Anderson Act, including specific limits and payment structures, align with the potential financial risks outlined in the nuclear generation risk factors and the broader operational and reputational risks facing the company?",
      "answer": "NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to $1,161 million ($664 million for FPL) per incident under the Price-Anderson Act, payable at a rate not exceeding $173 million ($99 million for FPL) per incident per year, as detailed in the insurance disclosures. These assessments are triggered for incidents at any U.S. nuclear reactor, regardless of fault or proximity. This financial exposure is reinforced in the nuclear generation risk factors, which note that such assessments could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business and financial condition. Additionally, the broader risk section highlights that NEE and FPL face reputational and operational risks from nuclear incidents, which could lead to regulatory scrutiny, legal proceedings, and loss of revenue. Thus, the retrospective assessments not only represent a direct financial liability but also tie into systemic risks related to public perception, regulatory action, and operational continuity.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nLiability  for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-A nderson A ct, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this A ct, NEE maintains the maximum amount of private liability  insurance obtainable, and participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides liability insurance coverage for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums, plus any applicable taxes, for an incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in Europe, regardless of fault or proximity to the incident. Such assessments, if levied, could materially adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNRC orders or new regulations related to increased security measures and any future safety requirements promulgated by the NRC could require NEE  and FPL to incur substantial operating and capital expenditures at their nuclear generation facilities and/or result in reduced revenues.\n\nThe NRC has broad authority to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation and maintenance of nuclear generation facilities, the addition of capacity at existing nuclear generation facilities and the construction of new nuclear generation facilities, and these requirements are subject to change. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC has the authority to impose fines and/or shut down a nuclear generation facility , depending upon the NRC's assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. A ny of the foregoing events could require NEE and FPL to incur increased costs and capital expenditures, and could reduce revenues.\n\nAny serious nuclear incident occurring at a NEE or FPL plant could result in substantial remediation costs and other expenses. A  major incident at a nuclear facility  any where in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear generation facility . A n incident at a nuclear facility  any where in the world also could cause the NRC to impose additional conditions or other requirements on the industry , or on certain types of nuclear generation units, which could increase costs, reduce revenues and result in additional capital expenditures for NEE and FPL.\n\nThe inability to operate any of NE E 's or F PL's nuclear generation units through the end of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nIf any of NEE's or FPL's nuclear generation facilities are not operated for any reason through the life of their respective operating licenses or planned license extensions, NEE or FPL may be required to increase depreciation rates, incur impairment charges and accelerate future decommissioning expenditures, any of which could materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, and for other purposes. If planned outages last longer than anticipated or if there are unplanned outages, NEE 's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear units are periodically removed from service to accommodate planned refueling and maintenance outages, including, but not limited to, inspections, repairs and certain other modifications as well as to replace equipment. In the event that a scheduled outage lasts longer than anticipated or in the event of an unplanned outage due to, for example, equipment failure, such outages could materially adversely affect NEE's or FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\n## Liquidity, Capital Requirements and Common Stock Risks\n\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit and capital markets, among other factors, may negatively affect NE E 's and F PL's ability to fund their liquidity and capital needs and to meet their growth objectives, and could also materially adversely affect their business, financial condition, liquidity , results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE and FPL rely on access to capital and credit markets as significant sources of liquidity for capital requirements, refinancing activities to support existing debt maturities and other requirements that are not satisfied by operating cash flows. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in those capital and credit markets related to, among others, inflation, rising or sustained higher interest rates and political, regulatory and geopolitical events, could increase NEE's and FPL's cost of capital and affect their ability  to fund their liquidity  and capital needs, to refinance ex isting indebtedness and to meet their growth objectives. If NEE or FPL is unable to access regularly the capital and credit markets on terms that are reasonable, it may have to delay raising capital, issue shorter-term securities and incur an unfavorable cost of capital, which, in turn, could adversely affect its ability to maintain and grow its business, could contribute to lower earnings and reduced financial flex ibility , and could hav e a material adv erse effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity , results of operations and prospects.\n\nAlthough certain NEE subsidiaries have used non-recourse or limited-recourse, project-specific or other financing in the past, market conditions, changes to regulatory capital requirements and other factors could adversely affect the future availability  of such financing.

T he charges associated w ith these agreements are recoverable through the fuel clause and totaled approximately $409 million, $417 million and $418 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively, of w hich $73 million, $99 million and $102 million, respectively, w ere eliminated in consolidation at NEE.\n\n(c) Includes approximately $870 million and $40 million for 2025 and 2026, respectively, of joint obligations of NEECH and NEER.\n\n(b) Includes approximately $175 million of commitments to invest in technology and other investments through 2031. See Note 9 - Other.\n\nInsurance - Liability  for accidents at nuclear power plants is governed by the Price-A nderson A ct, which limits the liability of nuclear reactor owners to the amount of insurance available from both private sources and an industry retrospective payment plan. In accordance with this A ct, NEE maintains $500 million of private liability  insurance per site, which is the maximum obtainable, except at Duane A rnold which obtained an exemption from the NRC and maintains a $100 million private liability  insurance limit. Each site, ex cept Duane A rnold, participates in a secondary financial protection system, which provides up to $15.8 billion of liability insurance coverage per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S. Under the secondary financial protection system, NEE is subject to retrospective assessments of up to $1,161 million ($664 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, per incident at any nuclear reactor in the U.S., payable at a rate not to exceed $173 million ($99 million for FPL) per incident per year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $20 million and $25 million, plus any applicable taxes, per incident, respectively.\n\nNEE  participates  in  a  nuclear  insurance  mutual  company ,  Nuclear  Electric  Insurance  Limited  (NEIL),  which  provides  property  damage,  nuclear  accident decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each plant for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear facilities, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. A dditionally , NEIL prov ides accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage at an insured nuclear plant. Pursuant to regulations of the NRC, each company's property damage insurance policies provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied first to place the plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident, and second, to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning, plant repair or restoration.\n\nNEE and FPL nuclear facilities each have accident property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning liability insurance from NEIL with limits of $1.5 billion, except for Duane A rnold which has a limit of $50 million due to being in a deferred decommissioning. A ll the nuclear facilities, except for Duane A rnold, also share an additional $1.25 billion nuclear accident insurance limit above their dedicated underlying limit. This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. A ll coverages are subject to sublimits and deductibles.\n\nNEE also participates in an insurance program that provides limited coverage for replacement power costs if a nuclear plant is out of service for an extended period of time because of an accident. In the event of an accident at one of NEE's or another participating insured's nuclear plants, NEE could be assessed up to $167 million ($104 million for FPL), plus any applicable taxes, in retrospective premiums in a policy year. NextEra Energy Resources and FPL are contractually entitled to recover a proportionate share of such assessments from the owners of minority interests in Seabrook, Duane A rnold and St. Lucie Unit No. 2, which approximates $3 million, $2 million and $4 million, plus any applicable taxes, respectively.\n\nDue to the high cost and limited coverage available from third-party insurers, NEE does not have property insurance coverage for a substantial portion of either its transmission and distribution property or natural gas pipeline assets. If FPL's storm restoration costs exceed the storm reserve, such storm restoration costs may be recovered, subject to prudence review by the FPSC, through surcharges approved by the FPSC or through securitization provisions pursuant to Florida law. See Note 1 - Storm Funds, Storm Reserves and Storm Cost Recovery.\n\nIn the event of a loss, the amount of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered from customers in the case of FPL, would be borne by NEE and FPL and could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.",

A dverse press coverage and other adverse statements, whether or not driven by political or public sentiment, may also result in investigations by regulators, legislators and law enforcement officials, internal investigations or in legal claims. Responding to the negative publicity and any resulting investigations and lawsuits, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the proceeding, can divert the time and effort of senior management from NEE's and FPL's business.\n\nAddressing any adverse publicity , governmental scrutiny or enforcement or other legal proceedings is time consuming and expensive and, regardless of the factual basis for the assertions being made, can have a negative impact on the reputation of NEE and FPL, on the morale and performance of their employees and  on  their  relationships  with  regulators.  It  may   also  hav e  a  negativ e  impact  on  their  ability   to  take  timely   adv antage  of  v arious  business  and  market opportunities. The direct and indirect effects of negative publicity , and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected if F PL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate franchise agreements on acceptable terms with municipalities and counties in F lorida.\n\nFPL may negotiate franchise agreements with municipalities and counties in Florida to provide electric services within such municipalities and counties, and electricity   sales generated pursuant to these agreements represent a very substantial portion of FPL's revenues. If FPL is unable to maintain, negotiate or renegotiate such franchise agreements on acceptable terms, it could contribute to lower earnings and FPL may not fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures, which could adversely affect NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's and F PL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected by work strikes or stoppages and increasing personnel costs.\n\nEmployee strikes or work stoppages could disrupt operations and lead to a loss of revenue and customers.  Personnel costs may also increase due to inflationary  or  competitiv e  pressures  on  payroll  and  benefits  costs  and  revised  terms  of  collectiv e  bargaining  agreements  with  union  employees.  These consequences could have a material adverse effect on NEE's and FPL's business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n\nNEE's ability to successfully identify , complete and integrate acquisitions is subject to significant risks, including, but not limited to, the effect of increased competition for acquisitions resulting from the consolidation of the energy industry.\n\nNEE is likely to encounter significant competition for acquisition opportunities that may become available as a result of the consolidation of the energy industry . In addition, NEE may be unable to identify attractive acquisition opportunities at favorable prices and to complete and integrate them successfully and in a timely manner.\n\n## Nuclear Generation Risks\n\nThe operation and maintenance of NEE 's and F PL's nuclear generation facilities involve environmental, health and financial risks that could result in fines or the closure of the facilities and in increased costs and capital expenditures.\n\nNEE's and FPL's nuclear generation facilities are subject to environmental, health and financial risks, including, but not limited to, those relating to site storage of spent nuclear fuel, the disposition of spent nuclear fuel, leakage and emissions of tritium and other radioactive elements in the event of a nuclear accident or otherwise, the threat of a terrorist attack or cyber incident and other potential liabilities arising out of the ownership or operation of the facilities. NEE and FPL maintain decommissioning funds and external insurance coverage which are intended to reduce the financial exposure to some of these risks; however, the cost of decommissioning nuclear generation facilities could exceed the amount available in NEE's and FPL's decommissioning funds, and the exposure to liability and property damages could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. If NEE or FPL is unable to recover the additional costs incurred through insurance or, in the case of FPL, through regulatory mechanisms, their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially adversely affected.\n\nIn the event of an incident at any nuclear generation facility in the U .S. or at certain nuclear generation facilities in E urope, NE E  and F PL could be assessed significant  retrospective  assessments and/or retrospective insurance premiums as a result of their participation in a secondary financial protection system and nuclear insurance mutual companies.",

      "question": "How does the significant decline in NextEra Energy Resources' equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees from $649 million in 2023 to $267 million in 2024 reconcile with the volatility in operating revenues tied to non-qualifying commodity hedges and the accounting treatment of derivatives in equity method investees?",
      "answer": "The decline in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees from $649 million in losses in 2023 to $267 million in 2024 aligns with the $0.8 billion pre-tax impairment charge recognized in 2024, which was partially offset by new investments contributing $494 million in revenues. This volatility is further contextualized by the impact of non-qualifying commodity hedges, which caused a swing from $2,529 million in gains in 2023 to $66 million in losses in 2024, contributing to earnings instability. Additionally, the accounting treatment of derivatives in equity method investees\u2014where changes in fair value are recognized in equity in earnings\u2014explains some of the year-over-year variability, particularly as non-qualifying hedges introduce mark-to-market volatility that is not economically offset in GAAP reporting.",

The assumptions in these models are critical since any changes therein could have a significant impact on the fair value of the derivative.\n\nAt FPL, substantially all changes in the fair value of energy derivative transactions are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the fuel clause. See Note 3.\n\nIn NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NextEra Energy Resources, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. NEE estimates the fair v alue of these deriv ativ es using an income approach based on a discounted cash flows valuation technique utilizing observable inputs.\n\nCertain derivative transactions at NEER are entered into as economic hedges but the transactions do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting, hedge accounting treatment is not elected or hedge accounting has been discontinued. Changes in the fair value of those transactions are marked to market and reported in the consolidated statements of income, resulting in earnings volatility. These changes in fair value are reflected in the non-qualifying hedge category in computing  adjusted  earnings  and  could  be  significant  to  NEER's  results  because  the  economic  offset  to  the  positions  are  not  marked  to  market. A s  a consequence, NEE's net income reflects only the movement in one part of economically-linked transactions. For example, a gain (loss) in the non-qualifying hedge category for certain energy derivatives is offset by decreases (increases) in the fair value of related physical asset positions in the portfolio or contracts, which are not marked to market under GAAP . For this reason, NEE's management views results expressed excluding the unrealized mark-to-market impact of the non-qualifying hedges as a meaningful measure of current period performance. For additional information regarding derivative instruments, see Note 3, Overview and Energy M arketing and Trading and M arket Risk Sensitivity.\n\n## Accounting for Pension Benefits\n\nNEE sponsors a qualified noncontributory defined benefit pension plan for substantially all employees of NEE and its subsidiaries. M anagement believes that, based on actuarial assumptions and the well-funded status of the pension plan, NEE will not be required to make any cash contributions to the qualified pension plan in the near future. The qualified pension plan has a fully funded trust dedicated to providing benefits under the plan. NEE allocates net periodic income associated with the pension plan to its subsidiaries annually using specific criteria.\n\n## Nature of Accounting Estimates\n\nFor the pension plan, the benefit obligation is the actuarial present value, as of the December 31 measurement date, of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered to that date. The amount of benefit to be paid depends on a number of future events incorporated into the pension benefit formula, including an estimate of the average remaining life of employees/survivors as well as the average years of service rendered. The projected benefit obligation is measured based on assumptions concerning future interest rates and future employee compensation levels. NEE derives pension income from actuarial calculations based on the plan's provisions and various management assumptions including discount rate, rate of increase in compensation levels and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets.\n\n## Assumptions and Accounting Approach\n\nAccounting guidance requires recognition of the funded status of the pension plan in the balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recognized in other comprehensive income within shareholders' equity in the year in which the changes occur. Since NEE is the plan sponsor, and its subsidiaries do not have separate rights to the plan assets or direct obligations to their employees, this accounting guidance is reflected at NEE and not allocated to the subsidiaries. The portion of previously unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and prior service costs or credits that are estimated to be allocable to FPL as net periodic (income) cost in future periods and that otherwise would be recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income are classified as regulatory assets and liabilities at NEE in accordance with regulatory treatment.",

      "question": "How does NEE's treatment of current other assets in terms of fair value categorization and restricted cash equivalents reconcile with the reported amounts in the nuclear decommissioning funds and derivative assets on the balance sheet?",
      "answer": "NEE's current other assets include $396 million at December 31, 2024, primarily categorized as Level 3 in fair value, while restricted cash equivalents amount to $109 million. These assets partially overlap with the nuclear decommissioning funds, which total $9,799 million as of December 31, 2024, and include equity and debt securities primarily at fair value. Additionally, the fair value disclosures show that FPL's current other assets include $13 million in derivative assets, indicating that current other assets are a mixed category encompassing both restricted funds and derivative instruments, with varying levels of fair value inputs and liquidity profiles.",

      "question": "How do the variations in weather-adjusted KWH sales trends across Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi Power reflect differences in customer usage and growth, and what does this suggest about regional demand dynamics in SO's service territories?",
      "answer": "In Alabama, weather-adjusted residential KWH sales decreased by 0.9%, primarily due to reduced customer usage, while commercial sales increased by 0.4%, driven by customer usage and growth. In Georgia, residential sales fell by 0.4%, mainly due to lower customer usage, but commercial sales rose by 1.2%, largely from customer growth. In Mississippi, residential sales increased by 0.7%, attributed to higher customer usage, and commercial sales surged by 7.1%, primarily due to customer growth. These variations suggest that Mississippi experienced the strongest customer-driven demand growth, especially in the commercial sector, while Alabama and Georgia saw more muted or negative trends in residential usage. This regional divergence indicates differing economic or demographic dynamics across SO's service areas.",

      "question": "How does the variation in net cash provided from financing activities across Southern Company's subsidiaries in 2023 reflect differences in capital structure management, debt issuance, and dividend policies when comparing reported cash flow figures with the qualitative discussion of financing activities?",
      "answer": "The net cash provided from financing activities in 2023 shows contrasting patterns across Southern Company's subsidiaries. Southern Power reported a net cash outflow for financing activities primarily due to senior note repayments and common stock dividend payments, while Southern Company (parent) reported a significant inflow of $1,922 million driven by net senior note issuances and capital contributions from the parent company. Georgia Power's financing activities were largely offsetting, with senior note issuances partially offset by dividend payments. This divergence reflects different capital structure strategies\u2014Southern Power focused on debt reduction and distributions, while the parent company increased leverage to fund investments. The qualitative discussion in the MD&A further supports this, noting that parent-level financing was driven by reofferings of revenue bonds and net senior note issuances, contrasting with Southern Power\u2019s emphasis on debt repayments and capital distributions to noncontrolling interests.",

        "Hop 3: [MD&A](page_110) \u2192 [Net Cash Provided from Financing Activities]: The MD&A explains that parent-level financing was driven by reofferings of pollution control revenue bonds and net senior note issuances, while Southern Power repaid senior notes and made net distributions to noncontrolling interests."

      "answer": "NextEra Energy reported $77 million in net gains on disposal of businesses/assets in 2021 on the consolidated income statement (page 112), which aligns with the larger $146 million figure reported in the cash flows from operating activities (page 64), indicating that the company realized gains from asset disposals during the year. Additionally, the reclassification of $23 million from accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) to gains on disposal of businesses/assets - net (page 82) shows that a portion of these gains were previously recorded in other comprehensive income and were now recognized in net income, contributing to the overall disposal gains recognized in operating cash flows.",

AND FLORIDA POWER &amp; LIGHT COMPANY NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n\ncontracts  as  the  capacity  is  provided.  These  contracts  also  contain  a  variable  price  component  for  energy  usage  which  FPL  recognizes  as revenue as the energy is delivered based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts.\n\nNEER - NEER's revenue from contracts with customers is derived primarily from the sale of energy commodities, electric capacity and electric transmission. For these types of sales, NEER recognizes revenue as energy commodities are delivered and as electric capacity and electric transmission are made available, consistent with the amounts billed to customers based on rates stipulated in the respective contracts as well as an accrual for amounts earned but not yet billed. The amounts billed and accrued represent the value of energy or transmission delivered and/or the capacity of energy or transmission available to the customer. Revenues yet to be earned under these contracts, which have maturity dates ranging  from  2022  to  2053,  will  vary  based  on  the  volume  of  energy  or  transmission  delivered  and/or  available.  NEER's  customers  typically receive bills monthly with payment due within 30 days. Certain contracts with customers contain a fixed price which primarily relate to electric capacity sales associated with independent system operator annual auctions through 2025 and certain power purchase agreements with maturity dates  through 2034. As  of  December  31,  2021,  NEER  expects  to  record  approximately  $735  million  of  revenues  related  to  the  fixed  price components of such contracts over the remaining terms of the related contracts as the capacity is provided.\n\n## 3. Derivative Instruments\n\nNEE and FPL use derivative instruments (primarily swaps, options, futures and forwards) to manage the physical and financial risks inherent in the purchase and sale of fuel and electricity, as well as interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated primarily with outstanding and expected future debt issuances and borrowings, and to optimize the value of NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets. NEE and FPL do not utilize hedge accounting for their cash flow and fair value hedges.\n\nWith respect to commodities related to NEE's competitive energy business, NEER employs risk management procedures to conduct its activities related to optimizing the value of its power generation and gas infrastructure assets, providing full energy and capacity requirements services primarily to distribution utilities, and engaging in power and fuel marketing and trading activities to take advantage of expected future favorable price movements and changes in the expected volatility of prices in the energy markets. These risk management activities involve the use of derivative  instruments  executed  within  prescribed  limits  to  manage  the  risk  associated  with  fluctuating  commodity  prices.  Transactions  in derivative instruments are executed on recognized exchanges or via the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, depending on the most favorable credit terms and market execution factors. For NEER's power generation and gas infrastructure assets, derivative instruments are used to hedge all or a portion of the expected output of these assets. These hedges are designed to reduce the effect of adverse changes in the wholesale forward commodity  markets  associated  with  NEER's  power  generation  and  gas  infrastructure  assets.  With  regard  to  full  energy  and  capacity requirements services, NEER is required to vary the quantity of energy and related services based on the load demands of the customers served. For this type of transaction, derivative instruments are used to hedge the anticipated electricity quantities required to serve these customers and reduce  the  effect  of  unfavorable  changes  in  the  forward  energy  markets.  Additionally,  NEER  takes  positions  in  energy  markets  based  on differences  between  actual  forward  market  levels  and  management's  view  of  fundamental  market  conditions,  including  supply/demand imbalances, changes in traditional flows of energy, changes in short- and long-term weather patterns and anticipated regulatory and legislative outcomes. NEER uses derivative instruments to realize value from these market dislocations, subject to strict risk management limits around market, operational and credit exposure.\n\nDerivative instruments, when required to be marked to market, are recorded on NEE's and FPL's consolidated balance sheets as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. At FPL, substantially all changes in the derivatives' fair value are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability until the contracts are settled, and, upon settlement, any gains or losses are passed through the applicable fuel and purchased power cost recovery clause (fuel clause). For NEE's non-rate regulated operations, predominantly NEER, essentially all changes in the derivatives' fair value for power purchases and sales, fuel sales and trading activities are recognized on a net basis in operating revenues and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. Settlement gains and losses are included within the line items in the consolidated statements of income to which they relate. Transactions for which physical delivery is deemed not to have occurred are presented on a net basis in the consolidated statements of income. For commodity derivatives, NEE believes that, where offsetting positions exist at the same location for the same time, the transactions are considered to have been netted and therefore physical  delivery  has  been  deemed  not  to  have  occurred  for  financial  reporting  purposes.  Settlements  related  to  derivative  instruments  are primarily recognized in net cash provided by operating activities in NEE's and FPL's consolidated statements of cash flows.\n\nFor interest rate and foreign currency derivative instruments, all changes in the derivatives' fair value, as well as the transaction gain or loss on foreign denominated debt, are recognized in interest expense and the equity method investees' related activity is recognized in equity in earnings (losses) of equity method investees in NEE's consolidated statements of income. In addition, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, NEE  reclassified  from  AOCI  approximately  $26  million  ($6  million  after  tax),  of  which  $23  million  was  reclassified  to  gains  on  disposal  of businesses/assets  -  net  (see  Note  1  -  Disposal  of  Businesses/Assets  and  Sale  of  Noncontrolling  Ownership  Interests)  with  the  balance  to interest expense, and $11 million ($8 million after tax) to",

      "question": "How does NEER's capital expenditure profile, as reflected in historical investments and future commitments, align with its tax and financing arrangements, particularly in light of its treatment under NEE's capital allocation and tax-sharing agreements?",
      "answer": "NEER's capital expenditures from 2019\u20132021 totaled $6,505 million in 2019, $6,893 million in 2020, and $8,363 million in 2021, showing a growing investment trend, particularly in renewables like wind and solar. Looking forward, NEER has committed $4,400 million in 2022 and declining amounts thereafter through 2026, indicating a tapering of near-term capital outlays. This capital structure appears supported by tax-related benefits, such as the Production Tax Credits (PTCs) NEER receives under its tax-sharing agreement with NEE. Additionally, NEER's financing is partially underpinned by a deemed capital structure allocating 70% debt financing from NEECH, which influences its interest expense and overall cost of capital. This interplay between capital deployment, tax benefits, and financing structure suggests a coordinated approach to funding NEER\u2019s growth while leveraging tax incentives and controlled debt exposure.",

      "question": "How did changes in net unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency translation affect NextEra Energy's comprehensive income and income statement over three years, and how is this reflected in both AOCI balances and derivative disclosures?",
      "answer": "Over the three-year period, NextEra Energy's net unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency translation had a fluctuating impact on both comprehensive income and the income statement. From the consolidated statements of comprehensive income (page 62), we see that foreign currency translation contributed a loss of $1 million in 2021, a gain of $13 million in 2020, and a gain of $22 million in 2019. These amounts flowed into accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) balances (page 109), where the ending balances for foreign currency translation were $(49) million in 2021, $(42) million in 2020, and $(63) million in 2019, showing a cumulative negative trend despite positive swings in individual years.\n\nAdditionally, these foreign currency translation impacts were connected to derivative disclosures (page 87), where unrealized gains (losses) on foreign currency translation were included in the consolidated statements of income in operating revenues and interest expense, with amounts of $(1,488) million in 2021, $569 million in 2020, and $956 million in 2019. This reveals a broader financial exposure tied to foreign currency movements, particularly in 2021, where the company experienced significant unrealized losses that impacted both the income statement and AOCI.

      "question": "How does the variation in 'Property and other taxes' across Duke Energy's different operating segments reflect on the company's overall tax burden and what might explain the differences in tax expenses between the Regulated Carolinas, Midwest, and Florida segments in 2024?",
      "answer": "In 2024, Duke Energy's 'Property and other taxes' expense varies significantly across its segments: $440 million in the Regulated Carolinas (page 100), $177 million in the Midwest (page 94), and $346 million in Florida (page 82). This variation reflects differing tax policies, regulatory environments, and asset bases across regions. The higher tax burden in Florida and the Carolinas compared to the Midwest suggests either a higher assessed value of property or different local tax rates. These differences directly impact the overall tax burden of the company and may influence capital allocation and rate-setting strategies in each region.",

        "Hop 3: [DUK](page_82) \u2192 Property and other taxes: $346 million in Florida segment highlights a moderate tax expense, higher than Midwest but lower than Carolinas."

      "question": "How did Duke Energy's impairment charges evolve across its Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, and Other segments in 2023 and 2024, and what does this trend suggest about the company's asset performance and strategic focus?",
      "answer": "In 2023, Duke Energy recorded $75 million in impairment charges for the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment, -$4 million for the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, and $14 million for the Other segment, totaling $85 million. In 2024, these charges dropped significantly to $37 million for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, $0 million for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, and $1 million for the Other segment, totaling $38 million. This represents a substantial year-over-year decline, particularly in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment. The -$4 million impairment in 2023 for the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment suggests a reversal or gain from prior impairments, indicating potential asset revaluation or divestiture activity. The reduction in impairments across all segments in 2024 implies improved asset management, fewer write-downs, and possibly a more disciplined capital allocation strategy, aligning with a stronger overall financial positioning.",

        "Hop 1: DUK (page_133) \u2192 Impairment and Charges: In 2023, the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment had $75 million in impairments, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure had -$4 million, and Other had $14 million.",

        "Hop 3: DUK (page_141) \u2192 Impairment and Charges: The Other segment showed a net impairment of $0 million in 2023 (with a -$1 million impairment offset by $1 million in eliminations/other adjustments), reinforcing the nuanced treatment of impairments across segments."

      "question": "How does Duke Energy's approach to auditing regulatory asset recoverability combine verification of deferred fuel and storm costs, coal ash liabilities, and management representations to support confidence in regulatory asset balances?",
      "answer": "Duke Energy's audit approach integrates multiple verification methods across different regulatory asset categories to ensure the overall confidence in recorded regulatory asset balances. From page 99, the company performs substantive analytical procedures on the recoverability of deferred fuel costs and test of details procedures on deferred storm costs, with additional support from internal legal counsel letters asserting the probability of cost recovery. On page 81, the audit includes specific procedures assessing the ongoing regulatory recoverability of asset retirement obligations related to coal ash, which introduces an environmental and long-term liability dimension. Finally, page 117 confirms that management provides formal representations asserting that all regulatory assets recorded in the financial statements are probable of recovery, which serves as a governance-level validation of the entire framework. Together, these steps form a comprehensive audit strategy that cross-checks asset recoverability from operational (fuel/storm), environmental (coal ash), and governance (representations) perspectives.",

The increase was primarily due to an increase in the average cost of natural gas.\n\nFuel and purchased power energy transactions do not have a significant impact on earnings since energy expenses are generally offset by energy revenues through Mississippi Power's fuel cost recovery clauses. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Mississippi Power - Fuel Cost Recovery\" and Note 1 to the financial statements under \"Fuel Costs\" for additional information.\n\nFuel expense increased $120 million, or 34.3%, in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to a 44.7% increase in the average cost of natural gas per KWH generated, partially offset by a 4.8% decrease in the volume of KWHs generated by natural gas.\n\nEnergy purchases will vary depending on the market prices of wholesale energy as compared to the cost of the Southern Company system's generation, demand for energy within the Southern Company system's service territory, and the availability of the Southern Company system's generation. These purchases are made in accordance with the IIC or other contractual agreements, as approved by the FERC.\n\n## Other Operations and Maintenance Expenses\n\nOther operations and maintenance expenses increased $29 million, or 10.2%, in 2021 compared to 2020. A portion of the increase in 2021 compared to 2020 reflects cost containment activities implemented to help offset the effects of the recessionary economy resulting from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. The increase was primarily due to increases of $7 million associated with the Kemper County energy facility (primarily related to increases in dismantlement activities and less salvage proceeds in 2021), $7 million in generation expenses associated with outage and non-outage maintenance, $6 million in distribution operations and maintenance, and $6 million in compensation and benefit expenses.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net increased $18 million, or 105.9%, in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to a $9 million decrease in charitable donations and increases of $6 million in non-service cost-related retirement benefits income and $3 million in interest associated with a sales-type lease. See Notes 9 and 11 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes increased $7 million, or 50.0%, in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher pre-tax earnings and an increase associated with lower flowback of excess deferred income taxes associated with new PEP rates that became effective for the first billing cycle of April 2021.

The increase was partially offset by a $36 million decrease in bad debt expense and a net decrease of $35 million to the NDR accrual in 2021 when compared to 2020. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Alabama Power - Rate NDR\" and \" - Rate CNP Compliance\" for additional information.\n\n## Depreciation and Amortization\n\nDepreciation and amortization increased $47 million, or 5.8%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to additional plant in service, including the purchase of the Central Alabama Generating Station in August 2020. See Notes 5 and 15 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Interest Expense, Net of Amounts Capitalized\n\nInterest expense, net of amounts capitalized increased $2 million, or 0.6%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase of approximately $17 million associated with higher average outstanding borrowings, largely offset by a decrease of approximately $16 million related to lower interest rates. See Note 8 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Other Income (Expense), Net\n\nOther income (expense), net increased $7 million, or 7.0%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in nonservice cost-related retirement benefits income. See Note 11 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome taxes increased $35 million, or 10.4%, in 2021 as compared to 2020 primarily due to higher pre-tax earnings. See Note 10 to the financial statements for additional information.\n\n## Georgia Power\n\nGeorgia Power's 2021 net income was $584 million, representing a $991 million, or 62.9%, decrease from the previous year. The decrease was primarily due to a $1.0 billion increase in after-tax charges related to the construction of Plant V ogtle Units 3 and 4. Also contributing to the decrease were higher non-fuel operations and maintenance costs, partially offset by higher retail revenues associated with sales growth. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information on the construction of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4.",

      "question": "How does Southern Company balance the long-term financial obligations tied to decommissioning Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2 with the potential cost overruns and regulatory uncertainties in building Units 3 and 4?",
      "answer": "Southern Company faces dual financial exposures at Plant Vogtle: long-term decommissioning obligations for Units 1 and 2 and significant construction cost risks for Units 3 and 4. According to page_249, the total site study decommissioning cost for Units 1 and 2 is estimated at $883 million, with decommissioning scheduled to begin in 2047 and conclude in 2079. These costs are accounted for under asset retirement obligations (AROs) as described on page_246, where liabilities are calculated using present value techniques and are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over its useful life. Meanwhile, page_101 reveals that Georgia Power is facing potential additional base capital costs of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per month for Unit 4, with uncertainty around whether these costs will be recoverable through regulated rates. This creates a financial tension: the company must manage a legacy asset with a long decommissioning horizon while also absorbing potentially material construction overruns on the new units, with no guarantee of cost recovery. The accounting treatment on page_246 allows for ongoing regulatory asset/liability adjustments, but the strategic challenge lies in justifying continued investment in nuclear given these layered risks.",

          "chunk_text": "## COMBINED MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (continued)\n\nSouthern Company and Subsidiary Companies 2021 Annual Report\n\n2, is estimated to result in additional base capital costs for Georgia Power of up to $60 million per month for Unit 3 and $40 million per month for Unit 4, as well as the related AFUDC and any additional related construction, support resources, or testing costs. While Georgia Power is not precluded from seeking retail recovery of any future capital cost forecast increase other than the amounts related to the cost-sharing and tender provisions of the joint ownership agreements described above, management will ultimately determine whether or not to seek recovery. Any further changes to the capital cost forecast that are not expected to be recoverable through regulated rates will be required to be charged to income and such charges could be material.\n\nGiven the significant complexity involved in estimating the future costs to complete construction and start-up of Plant Vogtle Units 3 and 4 and the significant management judgment necessary to assess the related uncertainties surrounding future rate recovery of any projected cost increases, as well as the potential impact on results of operations and cash flows, Southern Company and Georgia Power consider these items to be critical accounting estimates. See Note 2 to the financial statements under \"Georgia Power - Nuclear Construction\" for additional information.\n\n## Accounting for Income Taxes (Southern Company, Mississippi Power, Southern Power, and Southern Company Gas)\n\nThe consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require significant judgment and estimates. These estimates are supported by historical tax return data, reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions. The effective tax rate reflects the statutory tax rates and calculated apportionments for the various states in which the Southern Company system operates.\n\nSouthern Company files a consolidated federal income tax return and the Registrants file various state income tax returns, some of which are combined or unitary. Under a joint consolidated income tax allocation agreement, each Southern Company subsidiary's current and deferred tax expense is computed on a stand-alone basis and each subsidiary is allocated an amount of tax similar to that which would be paid if it filed a separate income tax return. In accordance with IRS regulations, each company is jointly and severally liable for the federal tax liability. Certain deductions and credits can be limited or utilized at the consolidated or combined level resulting in tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards that would not otherwise result on a stand-alone basis. Utilization of these carryforwards and the assessment of valuation allowances are based on significant judgment and extensive analysis of Southern Company's and its subsidiaries' current financial position and results of operations, including currently available information about future years, to estimate when future taxable income will be realized.\n\nCurrent and deferred state income tax liabilities and assets are estimated based on laws of multiple states that determine the income to be apportioned to their jurisdictions. States have various filing methodologies and utilize specific formulas to calculate the apportionment of taxable income. The calculation of deferred state taxes considers apportionment factors and filing methodologies that are expected to apply in future years. The apportionments and methodologies which are ultimately finalized in a manner inconsistent with expectations could have a material effect on the financial statements of the applicable Registrants.\n\nGiven the significant judgment involved in estimating tax credit and/or state NOL carryforwards and multi-state apportionments for all subsidiaries, the applicable Registrants consider deferred income tax liabilities and assets to be critical accounting estimates.\n\n## Asset Retirement Obligations (Southern Company, Alabama Power, Georgia Power, Mississippi Power, and Southern Company Gas)\n\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities.\n\nThe ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property",

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\n\nAROs are computed as the present value of the estimated costs for an asset's future retirement and are recorded in the period in which the liability is incurred. The estimated costs are capitalized as part of the related long-lived asset and depreciated over the asset's useful life. In the absence of quoted market prices, AROs are estimated using present value techniques in which estimates of future cash outlays associated with the asset retirements are discounted using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Estimates of the timing and amounts of future cash outlays are based on projections of when and how the assets will be retired and the cost of future removal activities. Each traditional electric operating company and natural gas distribution utility has received accounting guidance from its state PSC or applicable state regulatory agency allowing the continued accrual or recovery of other retirement costs for long-lived assets that it does not have a legal obligation to retire. Accordingly, the accumulated removal costs for these obligations are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory liabilities and amounts to be recovered are reflected in the balance sheets as regulatory assets.\n\nThe ARO liabilities for the traditional electric operating companies primarily relate to facilities that are subject to the CCR Rule and the related state rules, principally ash ponds. In addition, Alabama Power and Georgia Power have retirement obligations related to the decommissioning of nuclear facilities (Alabama Power's Plant Farley and Georgia Power's ownership interests in Plant Hatch and Plant Vogtle Units 1 and 2). See \"Nuclear Decommissioning\" herein for additional information. Other significant AROs include various landfill sites and asbestos removal for Alabama Power, Georgia Power, and Mississippi Power and gypsum cells and mine reclamation for Mississippi Power. The ARO liability for Southern Power primarily relates to its solar and wind facilities, which are located on long-term land leases requiring the restoration of land at the end of the lease.\n\nThe traditional electric operating companies and Southern Company Gas also have identified other retirement obligations, such as obligations related to certain electric transmission and distribution facilities, certain asbestos-containing material within long-term assets not subject to ongoing repair and maintenance activities, certain wireless communication towers, the disposal of polychlorinated biphenyls in certain transformers, leasehold improvements, equipment on customer property, and property associated with the Southern Company system's rail lines and natural gas pipelines. However, liabilities for the removal of these assets have not been recorded because the settlement timing for certain retirement obligations related to these assets is indeterminable and, therefore, the fair value of the retirement obligations cannot be reasonably estimated. A liability for these retirement obligations will be recognized when sufficient information becomes available to support a reasonable estimation of the ARO.\n\nSouthern Company and the traditional electric operating companies will continue to recognize in their respective statements of income allowed removal costs in accordance with regulatory treatment. Any differences between costs recognized in accordance with accounting standards related to asset retirement and environmental obligations and those reflected in rates are recognized as either a regulatory asset or liability in the balance sheets as ordered by the various state PSCs.\n\nDetails of the AROs included in the balance sheets are as follows:\n\n",
