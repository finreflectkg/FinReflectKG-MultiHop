      "question": "How does Apple's exposure to foreign exchange rate risk, as demonstrated by its value-at-risk estimates and historical margin impacts, reconcile with its hedging strategies and investment in derivative instruments to protect gross margins?",
      "answer": "Apple's gross margins are significantly exposed to foreign exchange rate risk, as highlighted by the $538 million and $669 million estimated one-day losses in fair value of foreign currency derivatives as of September 28, 2024, and September 30, 2023, respectively. This risk is further emphasized by the historical impact of exchange rate fluctuations on gross margins, particularly when the U.S. dollar strengthens, reducing the dollar value of foreign-currency-denominated sales. To mitigate this, Apple actively uses derivative instruments such as forwards and options to hedge up to 12 months of forecasted foreign currency exposure related to revenue and inventory purchases. Despite these hedging efforts, the company acknowledges that such strategies may not fully offset the financial impact of adverse exchange rate movements, especially given its selective hedging approach influenced by economic and accounting considerations.",

Furthermore, the segment faced a notable customer concentration risk in fiscal 2020, with one customer contributing 11% of total company revenue, highlighting potential vulnerabilities.

Our contribution  expense  for  fiscal  years  2022,  2021,  and  2020  was  $168  million,  $120  million,  and  $76  million, respectively.\n\n## Note 17 - Segment Information\n\nOur Chief Executive Officer, who is considered to be our chief operating decision maker, or CODM, reviews financial information  presented  on  an  operating  segment  basis  for  purposes  of  making  decisions  and  assessing  financial performance.\n\nOur Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related  infrastructure,  and  solutions  for  gaming  platforms;  Quadro/NVIDIA  RTX  GPUs  for  enterprise  workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse software for building 3D designs and virtual worlds.\n\nOur  Compute  &amp;  Networking  segment  includes  Data  Center  platforms  and  systems  for  AI,  HPC,  and  accelerated computing; Mellanox networking and interconnect solutions; automotive AI Cockpit, autonomous driving development agreements, and autonomous vehicle solutions; CMP; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and NVIDIA AI Enterprise and other software.\n\nOperating results by segment include costs or expenses that are directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments.\n\nThe  'All  Other'  category  includes  the  expenses  that  our  CODM  does  not  assign  to  either  Graphics  or  Compute  &amp; Networking  for  purposes  of  making  operating  decisions  or  assessing  financial  performance.  The  expenses  include stock-based  compensation  expense,  corporate  infrastructure  and  support  costs,  acquisition-related  costs,  IP-related costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM deems to be enterprise in nature.\n\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis. Depreciation and amortization expense directly attributable to each reportable segment is included in operating results for each segment. However, the CODM does not evaluate depreciation and amortization expense by operating segment and, therefore, it is not separately presented. There is no intersegment revenue. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for our consolidated financial statements. The table below presents details of our reportable segments and the 'All Other' category.\n\n",

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's historical trend in sales return allowances from fiscal years 2020 to 2022 align with its revenue recognition policy that relies on historical return rates, and what does this suggest about the consistency of its allowance estimation methodology?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA's sales return allowance fluctuated from $9 million in fiscal year 2020 to $17 million in 2021, and then to $13 million in 2022, indicating variability in return exposure. According to the revenue recognition policy, the company estimates sales return allowances based primarily on historical return rates. However, the significant year-over-year changes in the allowance\u2014such as a $8 million increase from 2020 to 2021 and a $4 million decrease from 2021 to 2022\u2014suggest that actual return patterns may have deviated from historical trends, prompting adjustments. This implies that while the company's policy emphasizes historical data, actual performance may require dynamic revisions to the allowance, impacting revenue accuracy and financial forecasting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [NVDA](page_102) \u2192 [Sales Return Allowance]: Provides historical data showing the allowance fluctuated from $9M (FY20) to $17M (FY21) to $13M (FY22), indicating variability in return exposure.",
        "Hop 2: [NVDA](page_49) \u2192 [Sales Return Allowance]: Explains that sales return allowances are estimated based on historical return rates, with adjustments made if returns are expected to exceed those rates.",
        "Hop 3: [NVDA](page_69) \u2192 [Sales Return Allowance]: Reinforces the revenue recognition policy that includes estimating returns at the time of revenue recognition, using historical data as the primary input."

Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated  product  returns  at  the  time  revenue  is  recognized,  based  primarily  on  historical  return  rates.  However,  if product returns for a fiscal period are anticipated to exceed historical return rates, we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns.\n\nOur customer programs involve rebates, which are designed to serve as sales incentives to resellers of our products in various target markets, and marketing development funds, or MDFs, which represent monies paid to our partners that are  earmarked  for  market  segment  development  and  are  designed  to  support  our  partners'  activities  while  also promoting NVIDIA products. We account for customer programs as a reduction to revenue and accrue for potential rebates and MDFs based on the amount we expect to be claimed by customers.\n\n## License and Development Arrangements\n\nOur  license  and  development  arrangements  with  customers  typically  require  significant  customization  of  our  IP components. As a result, we recognize the revenue from the license and the revenue from the development services as a  single  performance  obligation  over  the  period  in  which  the  development  services  are  performed.  We  measure progress to completion based on actual cost incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total cost required to complete each project. If a loss on an arrangement becomes probable during a period, we record a provision for such loss in that period.\n\nRefer to Note 1 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nWe recognize  federal,  state  and  foreign  current  tax  liabilities  or  assets  based  on  our  estimate  of  taxes  payable  or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction. We recognize federal, state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities, as appropriate, for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards; and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that, based on available evidence and judgment, are not expected to be realized.\n\nOur calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with  uncertainties  in  the  application  of  complex  tax  laws.  Our  estimates  of  deferred  tax  assets  and  liabilities  may change based, in part, on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome, changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the United States, or foreign jurisdictions where we operate, or changes in other facts or circumstances. In addition, we recognize liabilities for potential United States and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes may be due. If we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment, we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements accordingly.\n\nAs of January 30, 2022, we had a valuation allowance of $907 million related to state and certain other deferred tax assets  that  management  determined  are  not  likely  to  be  realized  due  to  jurisdictional  projections  of  future  taxable income,  tax  attributes  usage  limitation  by  certain  jurisdictions,  and  potential  utilization  limitations  of  tax  attributes acquired as a result of stock ownership changes. To the extent realization of the deferred tax assets becomes morelikely-than-not, we would recognize such deferred tax assets as an income tax benefit during the period.\n\nWe recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position. Our policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense.",

All share, equity award, and per share amounts and related shareholders' equity balances presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the Stock Split.\n\n## Fiscal Year\n\nWe operate on a 52- or 53-week year, ending on the last Sunday in January. Fiscal years 2022 and 2020 were both 52week years. Fiscal year 2021 was a 53-week year.\n\n## Reclassifications\n\nCertain prior fiscal year balances have been reclassified to conform to the current fiscal year presentation.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nOur consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVIDIA Corporation and our wholly-owned subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those  related  to  revenue  recognition,  cash  equivalents  and  marketable  securities,  accounts  receivable,  inventories, income  taxes,  goodwill,  stock-based  compensation,  litigation,  investigation  and  settlement  costs,  restructuring  and other  charges,  and  other  contingencies.  The  inputs  into  our  judgments  and  estimates  consider  the  economic implications of COVID-19. These estimates are based on historical facts and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nWe derive our revenue from product sales, including hardware and systems, license and development arrangements, software licensing, and cloud services. We determine revenue recognition through the following steps: (1) identification of the contract with a customer; (2) identification of the performance obligations in the contract; (3) determination of the transaction price; (4) allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract (where revenue is allocated  on  a  relative  standalone  selling  price  basis  by  maximizing  the  use  of  observable  inputs  to  determine  the standalone selling  price  for  each  performance  obligation);  and  (5)  recognition  of  revenue  when,  or  as,  we  satisfy  a performance obligation.\n\n## Product Sales Revenue\n\nRevenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of products to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products. Certain products are sold with support or an extended warranty for the incorporated system, hardware, and/or software. Support and extended warranty revenue are recognized ratably over the service period, or as services are performed. Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns, customer programs and any taxes collected from customers.\n\nFor products sold with a right of return, we record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated  product  returns  at  the  time  revenue  is  recognized,  based  primarily  on  historical  return  rates.

      "answer": "The $1.36 billion charge from the failed Arm acquisition appears in three different contexts across the 10-K: in the risk factors section (page 28), it is cited as a direct financial consequence of regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction; in the government regulations section (page 15), the termination is framed as a regulatory compliance cost that materially impacts the business; and in the MD&A section (page 44), the charge is explicitly recorded as an operating expense in Q1 FY2023, reflecting the write-off of the initial prepayment made in September 2020.

Stakeholder groups may find us insufficiently responsive to the implications of climate change, and therefore we may face legal action or reputational harm. We may not achieve our stated goal to source 100% of our global electricity use from renewable energy by the end of fiscal year 2025, which could harm our reputation, or we may incur additional, unexpected costs to achieve such a goal. We may also experience contractual disputes due to supply chain delays arising from climate change-related disruptions, which could result in increased litigation and costs.\n\nWe  also  face  risks  related  to  business  trends  that  may  be  influenced  by  climate  change  concerns.  We  may  face decreased demand for computationally powerful but energy intensive products, such as our GPUs, despite their energy efficient  design and operation, and/or increased consumer or customer expectations around the energy efficiency of our products, could negatively impact our business.\n\nWe may not be able to realize the potential benefits of business investments or acquisitions, and we may not be  able  to  successfully  integrate  acquisition  targets,  which  could  hurt  our  ability  to  grow  our  business, develop new products or sell our products.\n\nWe have and may continue to acquire and invest in businesses that offer products, services and technologies that we believe will help expand or enhance our existing strategic objectives.\n\nAcquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. Given that  our  resources  are  limited,  if  we  pursue  a  particular  transaction,  we  may  limit  our  ability  to  enter  into  other transactions  that  could  help  us  achieve  our  strategic  objectives.  If  we  are  unable  to  timely  complete  acquisitions, including  due  to  delays  and  challenges  in  obtaining  regulatory  approvals,  we  may  be  unable  to  pursue  other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company, technology may evolve and make the acquisition  less  attractive,  and  other  changes  can  take  place  which  could  reduce  the  anticipated  benefits  of  the transaction and negatively impact our business. For example, on February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement  whereby  NVIDIA  would  have  acquired Arm  from  SoftBank.  The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction. We intend to record in operating expenses a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions has been harmed, future acquisitions may be more difficult, complex or expensive. Further, if we hold investments in publicly traded companies, they could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment.\n\nRisks related to acquisitions or strategic investments include, but are not limited to:\n\n- difficulty in integrating the technology, products, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees of the acquired business;\n- diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention;\n- assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n- integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n- coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n- difficulty in realizing a satisfactory return and uncertainties to realize the benefits of an acquisition or strategic investment, if at all;\n- difficulty  or  inability  in  obtaining  governmental,  regulatory  approval  or  restrictions  or  other  consents  and approvals or financing;\n- Stock  price  impact,  fines,  fees  or  reputation  harm  if  we  are  unable  to  obtain  regulatory  approval  for  an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\n- legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment;\n- potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;",

We expect an increasingly competitive environment in the future.\n\nOur current competitors include:\n\n- suppliers  and  licensors  designing  discrete  and  integrated  GPUs,  custom  chips  and  other  accelerated computing solutions, such as Advanced Micro Devices, or AMD, and Intel Corporation, or Intel;\n- large internet services companies with internal teams designing chips that incorporate accelerated computing functionality as part of their internal solutions or platforms, such as Alibaba Group, Alphabet, and Amazon;\n- suppliers of SoC products that are embedded into automobiles, autonomous machines, and gaming devices, such as Ambarella, Inc.,  AMD,  Broadcom  Inc., Intel, Qualcomm  Incorporated, Renesas  Electronics Corporation, and Samsung, or companies with internal teams designing SoC products for internal use, such as Tesla Motors; and\n- suppliers  of  interconnect,  switch  and  cable  solutions  such  as  AMD,  Applied  Optoelectronics,  Inc.,  Arista Networks, Broadcom, Cisco, HP, Intel, Juniper Networks, Inc., Lumentum Holdings, and Marvell Technology Group, as well as internal teams of system vendors and large internet services companies such as Alphabet and Amazon.\n\n## Patents and Proprietary Rights\n\nWe  rely  primarily  on  a  combination  of  patents,  trademarks,  trade  secrets,  employee  and  third-party  nondisclosure agreements, and licensing arrangements to protect our IP in the United States and internationally. Our currently issued patents  have  expiration  dates  from  February  2022  to  June  2045.  We  have  numerous  patents  issued,  allowed,  and pending in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. Our patents and pending patent applications primarily relate to our  products  and  the  technology  used  in  connection  with  our  products.  We  also  rely  on  international  treaties, organizations, and foreign laws to protect our IP. The laws of certain foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold, including various countries in Asia, may not protect our products or IP rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. This decreased protection makes the possibility of piracy of our technology and products more likely. We continuously assess whether and where to seek formal protection for particular innovations and technologies based on such factors as:\n\n- the location in which our products are manufactured;\n- our strategic technology or product directions in different countries;\n- the degree to which IP laws exist and are meaningfully enforced in different jurisdictions; and\n- the  commercial  significance  of  our  operations  and  our  competitors'  operations  in  particular  countries  and regions.\n\nWe have licensed technology from third parties and expect to continue to enter into such license agreements.\n\n## Government Regulations\n\nOur worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Our acquisitions may be subject to government regulatory reviews, and the cost to comply with such regulations or costs incurred where regulatory challenges prevent the completion of an acquisition could have a material  impact  on  our  business.  On  February  8,  2022,  we  announced  the  termination  of  the  Share  Purchase Agreement by which we would have acquired Arm due to significant regulatory challenges preventing the completion of the transaction and expect to incur a $1.36 billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023. Compliance with laws, rules, and regulations has not otherwise had a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position and we do not currently anticipate material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities. Compliance  with  existing  or  future  governmental  regulations,  including,  but  not  limited  to,  those  pertaining  to  IP ownership and infringement, taxes, import and export requirements and tariffs, anti-corruption, business acquisitions, foreign  exchange  controls  and  cash  repatriation  restrictions,  data  privacy  requirements,  competition  and  antitrust, advertising,  employment,  product  regulations,  cybersecurity,  environmental,  health  and  safety  requirements,  the responsible  use  of  AI,  climate  change,  cryptocurrency,  and  consumer  laws,  could  increase  our  costs,  impact  our competitive  position,  and  otherwise  may  have  a  material  adverse  impact  on  our  business,  financial  condition  and results of operations in subsequent periods.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors',  our  Consolidated  Financial  Statements  and  related  Notes  thereto,  as  well  as  other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock.\n\n## Overview\n\n## Our Company and Our Businesses\n\nNVIDIA  pioneered  accelerated  computing  to  help  solve  the  most  challenging  computational  problems.  Since  our original focus on PC graphics, we have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled  by  the  sustained  demand  for  exceptional  3D  graphics  and  the  scale  of  the  gaming  market,  NVIDIA  has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, AI, data science, AV, robotics, AR and VR.\n\nOur  two  operating  segments  are  \"Graphics\"  and  \"Compute  &amp;  Networking.\"  Refer  to  Note  17  of  the  Notes  to  the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA was incorporated in California in April 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in April 1998.\n\n## Recent Developments, Future Objectives and Challenges\n\n## Termination of the Arm Share Purchase Agreement\n\nOn February 8, 2022, NVIDIA and SoftBank announced the termination of the Share Purchase Agreement whereby NVIDIA would have acquired Arm from SoftBank. The parties agreed to terminate because of significant regulatory challenges  preventing  the  completion  of  the  transaction.  We  intend  to  record  in  operating  expenses  a  $1.36  billion charge in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023 reflecting the write-off of the prepayment provided at signing in September 2020.\n\n## Demand\n\nDemand for our products is based on many factors, including our product introductions, time to market, transitions, competitor product releases and announcements, and competing technologies, all of which can impact the timing and volume of our revenue. GPUs have use cases in addition to their designed and marketed use case, such as for digital currency  mining,  including  blockchain-based  platforms  such  as  Ethereum.  It  is  difficult  for  us  to  estimate  with  any reasonable degree of precision the past or current impact of cryptocurrency mining, or forecast the future impact of cryptocurrency  mining,  on  demand  for  our  products.  Volatility  in  the  cryptocurrency  market,  including  new  compute technologies,  price  changes  in  cryptocurrencies,  government  cryptocurrency  policies  and  regulations,  and  new cryptocurrency  standards  can  impact  and  have  impacted  in  the  past  cryptocurrency  demand,  and  further  impact demand for our products and our ability to estimate demand for our products. Changes to cryptocurrency standards and processes including, but not limited to, the pending Ethereum 2.0 standard may decrease the usage of GPUs for Ethereum mining and may also create increased aftermarket resale of our GPUs, impact retail prices for our GPUs, increase  returns  of  our  products  in  the  distribution  channel,  and  may  reduce  demand  for  our  new  GPUs.  We  have introduced LHR GeForce GPUs with limited Ethereum mining capability and increased the supply of CMP in an effort to address demand from gamers and direct miners to CMP. Beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year 2022, nearly all our desktop NVIDIA Ampere architecture GeForce GPU shipments were LHR in our effort to direct GeForce to gamers. If attempts in the aftermarket to improve the hash rate capabilities of our LHR cards are successful, our gaming cards may become more attractive to miners, and therefore limit our ability to supply our cards to non-mining customers. We cannot  predict  whether  our  strategy  of  using  LHR  cards  and  CMP  will  achieve  our  desired  outcome.  Additionally, consumer and enterprise behavior during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it more difficult for us to estimate future demand and may have changed pre-pandemic behaviors, and these challenges may be more pronounced or volatile in the  future  on  both  a  global  and  regional  basis.  In  estimating  demand  and  evaluating  trends,  we  make  multiple assumptions, any of which may prove to be incorrect.\n\n## Supply\n\nOur manufacturing lead times are very long and in some cases, extend to be twelve months or longer, which requires us to make estimates of customers' future demand. These conditions could lead to a significant mismatch between supply  and  demand,  giving  rise  to  product  shortages  or  excess  inventory,  and  make  our  demand  forecast  more uncertain.

      "answer": "Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment demonstrates strong growth and strategic importance, evidenced by its revenue increasing to $105.362 billion in fiscal year 2024 from $87.907 billion in 2023 and $74.965 billion in 2022. This aligns with its operating income rising to $49.584 billion in 2024 from $37.884 billion in 2023 and $33.203 billion in 2022, reflecting the segment's profitability. Internally, Microsoft categorizes Intelligent Cloud to include both server products and cloud services (like Azure, SQL Server, and Windows Server) as well as enterprise and partner services, indicating its strategic focus on providing comprehensive cloud and enterprise solutions. This strategic framing is consistent with its financial performance, showing it as a key driver of Microsoft\u2019s overall growth and profitability.",

      "answer": "Cisco reported a $145 million impairment charge related to purchased intangible assets in fiscal 2024, driven by reduced expected future cash flows from certain IPR&D assets. This impairment is part of the broader amortization of purchased intangible assets, which spiked from $931 million in fiscal 2023 to $1,653 million in fiscal 2024, indicating a significant increase in acquisition-related amortization burden. This jump aligns with the pro forma adjustments related to the Splunk acquisition and other fiscal 2024 acquisitions totaling $1.4 billion, which included amortization of purchased intangible assets as a key financial impact. Together, these figures suggest that recent acquisitions have substantially increased Cisco's amortization expense, with the impairment charge reflecting potential underperformance of certain acquired intangible assets.",

      "answer": "Cisco's Observability revenue grew from $581 million in fiscal 2022 to $661 million in fiscal 2023, and then to $837 million in fiscal 2024. This represents an absolute dollar increase of $80 million (14%) from 2022 to 2023 and $176 million (27%) from 2023 to 2024. In percentage terms, Observability outperformed most other product segments in 2024, showing stronger growth than Security (32% growth but from a smaller base) and significantly outpacing Networking (-15% decline) and Collaboration (+2%). In contrast, Networking remained the largest segment in absolute dollar terms but declined year-over-year, highlighting Observability as a key growth driver in Cisco\u2019s product portfolio.",

On page_84, the segment\u2019s operating margin was highlighted at 23%, down from 26% the previous year, signaling margin pressure amid declining sales.

      "answer": "Texas Instruments has a projected U.S. Defined Benefit payout of $80 million in 2025, declining to $54 million by 2029, with $193 million expected from 2030 to 2034. However, the plan was underfunded by $83 million at the end of 2024, indicating a significant liability relative to its funded status. This underfunding contrasts with the historical net periodic benefit cost, which was $13 million in 2024, showing that ongoing costs are smaller than the unfunded liability, suggesting long-term financial pressure.",

Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate v alue.\n\n## Product information\n\nSemiconductors are electronic components that serv e as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as 'chips,' combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We hav e a div erse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as conv erting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other dev ices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improv ing signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes more than 80,000 products that are integral to almost ev ery type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $12.16 billion of rev enue in 2024. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to prov ide the power to run dev ices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic dev ices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotiv e and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 78% of our rev enue in 2024.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different v oltage lev els, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated DC/DC switching regulators, power switches, linear and low-dropout regulators, v oltage references, multiphase controllers and power stages, and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or conv erted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data conv erters, interface products, motor driv es, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $2.53 billion of rev enue in 2024. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our dev ices v ary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex dev ices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotiv e.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often inv est their own R&amp;D to write software that operates on our products. This inv estment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

No end customer accounted for 10% or more of rev enue in 2023 or 2022.\n\n## 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements hav e been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions hav e been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar and share amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are presented in millions unless otherwise indicated. We hav e reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods' financial statements to conform to the 2024 presentation.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may v ary.\n\n## Significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, and recognize rev enue when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or deliv ery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products.\n\nRevenue from sales of our products that are subject to inv entory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inv entory that we store at designated locations. Deliv ery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inv entory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control ov er the products' disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products.\n\nThe rev enue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns and incentiv es. We recognize shipping fees receiv ed from customers, if any, in rev enue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of rev enue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.\n\n## Advertising costs\n\nWe expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $30 million, $28 million and $27 million in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectiv ely.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to ev ents that hav e been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a v aluation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\n## Other assessed taxes\n\nSome transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, v alue-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from rev enue) basis.",

We will inv est to strengthen our competitiv e adv antages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate v alue.\n\n## Product information\n\nSemiconductors are electronic components that serv e as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as 'chips,' combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We hav e a div erse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as conv erting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other dev ices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improv ing signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes more than 80,000 products that are integral to almost ev ery type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $12.16 billion of rev enue in 2024. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to prov ide the power to run dev ices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic dev ices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotiv e and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 78% of our rev enue in 2024.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different v oltage lev els, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated DC/DC switching regulators, power switches, linear and low-dropout regulators, v oltage references, multiphase controllers and power stages, and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or conv erted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data conv erters, interface products, motor driv es, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $2.53 billion of rev enue in 2024. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our dev ices v ary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex dev ices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotiv e.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often inv est their own R&amp;D to write software that operates on our products. This inv estment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

      "question": "Given the strategic emphasis on embedded processing as part of TI's long-term growth model and its 19% revenue contribution in 2023, how does the company's segment definition and resource allocation framework support or constrain the growth potential of this segment relative to the Analog segment?",
      "answer": "TI's Embedded Processing segment, contributing 19% of 2023 revenue, is strategically positioned as a key growth lever alongside Analog. The business model emphasizes embedded processing as one of two core segments, benefiting from shared manufacturing infrastructure and centralized support functions like procurement and logistics (page_30). However, unlike the Analog segment which has two major product lines (Power and Signal Chain), Embedded Processing is defined more narrowly around microcontrollers, DSPs, and applications processors (page_4). The company allocates resources based on operating segment metrics, with depreciation and shared costs charged to segments on a per-unit basis\u2014this could influence investment capacity for embedded processing relative to Analog. While the strategic focus on embedded processing aligns with long-term growth ambitions, its narrower product scope and shared cost structure may constrain its ability to scale independently compared to the more diversified Analog segment.",

      "answer": "TI's Analog Segment is strategically positioned as a core driver of revenue, generating $13.04 billion in 2023, or 74% of total revenue, particularly in industrial, automotive, and personal electronics markets. This aligns with the company's business model that emphasizes analog and embedded processing as key competitive advantages. Operationally, the Analog Segment is organized into two major product lines\u2014Power and Signal Chain\u2014and is integrated into TI's centralized manufacturing and support functions, such as procurement and logistics, with costs charged to segments on a per-unit basis. This cost structure, which includes depreciation expenses indirectly through unit-based allocations, supports the segment's scalability and efficiency, reinforcing TI's strategy of disciplined capital allocation and long-term free cash flow growth.",

      "answer": "The net actuarial loss for defined benefit plans decreased from $249 million in 2022 to $207 million in 2023, as shown on page 54. This $42 million reduction aligns with the total change to AOCI in 2023, which includes a $28 million decrease from adjustments and a $20 million decrease recognized in net income (as detailed on page 55). On page 47, the AOCI balance related to net actuarial loss for defined benefit plans reflects this change, showing a $28 million decrease from adjustments and a $13 million decrease recognized in net income (offset partially by $8 million in tax effect).

      "answer": "Texas Instruments reports stock compensation as a non-cash adjustment to net income in operating cash flows at $362 million in 2023, indicating its material role in employee incentives. This compensation also reduces the effective tax rate by 1.0% in 2023, showing its tax-effected impact on profitability. Additionally, stock compensation contributes $163 million to deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2023, reflecting its long-term financial implications in the company\u2019s tax planning and balance sheet positioning. Together, these perspectives highlight stock compensation as both an operational expense and a strategic lever affecting cash flow, tax efficiency, and asset structure.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's overall margin percentage performance in fiscal 2024 reflect the contrasting trends in its services, cloud/license, and hardware business segments, particularly in terms of revenue and expense dynamics?",
      "answer": "Oracle's total margin percentage remained flat at 64% in fiscal 2024 compared to fiscal 2023 in the cloud and license segment, despite a 9% increase in total revenues, driven by a 25% growth in cloud services revenue. However, in the services business, the margin percentage decreased due to a drop in total revenues, even though expenses remained flat in constant currency. Meanwhile, the hardware segment saw a slight improvement in total margin percentage from 59% to 62%, despite a 6% decline in total revenues, as expenses decreased by 14%. This shows that while the cloud and license business supported margin stability, the services segment pressured margins, offset by modest gains in hardware efficiency.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's treatment of Acquisition Related and Other Expenses in fiscal 2024 reflect in its operating expense categorization, segment reporting methodology, and year-over-year financial trends?",
      "answer": "Oracle's Acquisition Related and Other Expenses in fiscal 2024 totaled $314 million, a significant increase from $190 million in fiscal 2023, indicating a rise in acquisition-related activity. However, these expenses are not attributed to any of Oracle's three operating segments (cloud and license, hardware, and services) in the segment reporting, suggesting they are treated as corporate-level costs.

      "answer": "Oracle's cloud services and license support expenses increased from $7,763 million in fiscal 2023 to $9,427 million in fiscal 2024 (page 68), driven by investments in data center capacity and new geographic locations to meet customer demand. This aligns with the growth in cloud services and license support revenues, which rose from $35,307 million in fiscal 2023 to $39,383 million in fiscal 2024 (page 68), indicating a direct correlation between rising investment and revenue generation. The company's strategic focus on cloud-based deployment models is reinforced by its emphasis on Oracle Cloud Services offerings, which are delivered via subscription-based cloud models and recognized ratably over contract terms (page 49). The growth in cloud expenses reflects Oracle's forward-looking strategy to scale infrastructure in line with customer adoption of cloud technologies (page 50).",

      "question": "How does Oracle's growth in cloud and license business revenues across fiscal 2024, as reported in both constant currency and regional contribution terms, align with its strategic emphasis on infrastructure technologies like Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and the Autonomous Database, and what does this imply about the sustainability of margin expansion in this segment?",
      "answer": "Oracle's cloud and license business revenues increased in fiscal 2024 in constant currency, driven by growth in cloud services and license support revenues, particularly in the Americas (71%), EMEA (18%), and Asia Pacific (11%). This aligns with Oracle's strategic focus on infrastructure technologies such as Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) and the Autonomous Database, which are marketed as scalable, secure, and differentiated offerings that support both cloud and on-premise deployments. Despite rising infrastructure costs to support cloud growth, the cloud and license business margin increased in fiscal 2024 due to higher revenues, with margin as a percentage of revenue remaining flat. This suggests that while Oracle is successfully driving revenue growth through its infrastructure cloud offerings, the margin expansion is currently tied to top-line growth rather than cost efficiencies, raising questions about the long-term sustainability of margin improvement without corresponding cost containment or pricing power.",

        "Hop 3: [ORCL](page_47) \u2192 [Cloud and License Business Revenues]: Confirms the overall revenue increase in fiscal 2024 was primarily due to the cloud and license business, with growth in cloud services and support contracts offsetting declines in cloud and on-premise license revenues."

      "question": "Given Oracle's strategic emphasis on customer flexibility in deploying applications, how does the decline in cloud license and on-premise license revenues in fiscal 2024 reconcile with the expectation that continued demand for these offerings would support overall cloud and license revenue growth, and how does the revenue recognition framework for these licenses influence this dynamic?",
      "answer": "Oracle's strategic emphasis on customer flexibility in deploying applications through cloud license and on-premise license models is intended to drive continued demand for these offerings, which, alongside growth in cloud services, is expected to support overall revenue growth in the cloud and license business. However, in fiscal 2024, despite this strategic positioning, cloud license and on-premise license revenues actually declined, offsetting some of the growth seen in cloud services and license support revenues. This decline suggests that while Oracle's strategy supports broader adoption of cloud services, the upfront revenue recognition nature of cloud and on-premise licenses\u2014recognized at the point in time when software is made available\u2014can lead to volatility in reported revenues. This contrasts with the more predictable, ratably recognized revenue streams from cloud services and license support, which grew during the same period. Thus, while Oracle's strategy and revenue recognition framework support long-term growth, short-term fluctuations in license transactions can still impact overall revenue trends.",

        "Hop 1: ORCL(page_42) \u2192 Cloud License and On-Premise License Revenues: Oracle emphasizes customer flexibility in deployment models and expects continued demand for cloud license and on-premise license offerings to support revenue growth, noting that license revenues are recognized upfront at the point of delivery.",

        "Hop 3: ORCL(page_73) \u2192 Cloud License and On-Premise License Revenues: Cloud license and on-premise license revenues are primarily derived from perpetual licenses, with the majority including optional license support contracts, and are recognized at the point of delivery, contributing to revenue volatility."

      "answer": "CRM's subscription and support revenues, which accounted for 94% of total revenues in fiscal 2025, grew primarily due to volume increases from new business, including new customers, upgrades, and additional subscriptions. This aligns with the growth in remaining performance obligation, which reached $63.4 billion, reflecting the compounding effect of annual billing patterns, especially in the fourth quarter. The seasonal nature of billings\u2014where the fourth quarter is the strongest for new business and renewals\u2014explains the disproportionate weighting of annual billings during this period, which in turn drives higher operating cash flow in the following first quarter. Despite this seasonality, attrition rates remained consistent at around 8%, supporting sustained revenue growth in subscription and support.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nintegrated into our customer success organization. As of January 31, 2025, our attrition rate, ex cluding Slack self-service, was approx imately eight percent.\n\nWe continue to maintain a variety of customer programs and initiatives, which, along with increasing enterprise adoption, have helped keep our attrition rate consistent as compared to the prior year. Consistent attrition rates play a role in our ability to maintain growth in our subscription and support revenues.\n\n## Seasonal Nature of Unearned Revenue, Accounts Receivable and Operating Cash Flow\n\nUnearned revenue primarily consists of billings to customers for our subscription service. Over 90 percent of the value of our billings to customers is for our subscription and support service. We generally invoice our customers in advance, in annual installments, and typical payment terms provide that our customers pay us within 30 days of invoice. Amounts that have been invoiced are recorded in accounts receivable and in unearned revenue or in revenue depending on whether transfer of control to customers has occurred. In general, we collect our billings in advance of the subscription service period. We typically issue renewal invoices in advance of the renewal service period, and depending on timing, the initial invoice for the subscription and services contract and the subsequent renewal invoice may occur in different quarters. There is a disproportionate weighting toward annual billings in the fourth quarter, primarily as a result of large enterprise account buying patterns. Our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals. The year-on-year compounding effect of this seasonality in both billing patterns and overall new and renewal business causes the value of invoices that we generate in the fourth quarter for both new business and renewals to increase as a proportion of our total annual billings. Accordingly, because of this billing activity, our first quarter is typically our largest collections and operating cash flow quarter. G enerally, our third quarter has historically been our smallest operating cash flow quarter. Unearned revenues, accounts receivable and operating cash flow may also be impacted by acquisitions. For example, operating cash flows may be adversely impacted by acquisitions due to transaction costs, financing costs such as interest expense and lower operating cash flows from the acquired entity.\n\n## Remaining Performance Obligation\n\nOur remaining performance obligation represents all future revenue under contract that has not yet been recognized as revenue and includes unearned revenue and unbilled amounts. Our current remaining performance obligation represents future revenue under contract that is expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.\n\nRemaining performance obligation is not necessarily indicative of future revenue growth and is influenced by several factors, including seasonality, the timing of renewals, average contract terms, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in new business growth. Remaining performance obligation is also impacted by acquisitions. Unbilled portions of the remaining performance obligation denominated in foreign currencies are revalued each period based on the period end exchange rates. For multi-year subscription agreements billed annually, the associated unbilled balance and corresponding remaining performance obligation are typically high at the beginning of the contract period, zero just prior to renewal, and increase if the agreement is renewed. Low remaining performance obligation attributable to a particular subscription agreement is often associated with an impending renewal but may not be an indicator of the likelihood of renewal or future revenue from such customer. Changes in contract duration or the timing of delivery of professional services can impact remaining performance obligation as well as the allocation between current and non-current remaining performance obligation.\n\n## Cost of Revenues and Operating E xpenses\n\n## Cost of Revenues\n\nCost of subscription and support revenues primarily consists of expenses related to our employee-related costs, which includes salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation expense, delivering our service and providing support, including the costs of data center capacity, certain fees paid to various third parties for the use of their technology, services and data, and allocated overhead. Our cost of subscription and support revenues also includes amortization of certain acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company's research and development efforts. Also included in the cost of subscription and support revenues are expenses incurred supporting the free user base of Slack, including third-party hosting costs and employee-related costs specific to customer experience and technical operations.\n\nCost of professional services and other revenues consists primarily of employee-related costs associated with these services, the cost of subcontractors, certain third-party fees and allocated overhead. We believe that our professional services organization facilitates the adoption of our service offerings, helps us to secure larger subscription revenue contracts and supports our customers' success. The cost of professional services may exceed revenues from professional services in future fiscal periods.\n\n## Research and Development\n\nResearch and development expenses consist primarily of employee-related costs for our engineering staff associated with product development, as well as allocated overhead.",

Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2025 was $14.0 billion.\n- Remaining Performance Obligation: Total remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract yet to be recognized, as of January 31, 2025 was approximately $63.4 billion, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2025 was approximately $30.2 billion, an increase of nine percent year-overyear.\n- Share Repurchase Program: During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of our common stock for approximately $7.8 billion.\n- Dividend Program : During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends.\n\nIn the second half of fiscal 2025, we continued seeing increasing momentum for Agentforce and other AI service offerings. Outside of the demand for AI, the buying environment trends seen over the past two fiscal years have stabilized. A reemergence of slower growth in new and renewal business could impact our remaining performance obligation, revenues and our ability to meet financial guidance and long-term targets.\n\nIn addition, the ex panding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Total revenues in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 were minimally impacted by foreign currency fluctuations compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Our current remaining performance obligation growth as of January 31, 2025 compared to January 31, 2024 was negatively impacted by two percent compared to what would have been reported using constant currency rates. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations could impact our near-term results and ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. The impact of these fluctuations can also be compounded by the seasonality of our business in which our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals.\n\n## Fiscal Year\n\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for ex ample, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 'Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies' to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\n## Sources of Revenues\n\nWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2025.\n\nSubscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, 'Cloud Services'), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses, and support revenues from the sale of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees or related to the sales of software licenses. Our Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from support and updates is recognized as such support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year term software licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from term software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2025.\n\nThe revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in 'Results of Operations,' fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be ex pected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offerings to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer's actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer's current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer's business requirements and usage.\n\nOur growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. In general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully",

      "answer": "The Subscription and Support Revenue grew by 10% year-over-year, increasing from $32,537 million to $35,679 million. However, its gross margin percentage declined from 18% to 16%, reflecting a slight increase in cost of revenues from $6,177 million to $6,198 million. Despite this margin contraction, the segment's strong revenue growth contributed significantly to the overall income from operations, which rose from $5,011 million to $7,205 million year-over-year. This indicates that the scale of revenue growth outweighed margin pressures in driving profitability.",

      "answer": "Salesforce reported a decrease in professional services and other revenues for fiscal 2025, primarily due to reduced demand for large, multi-year transformation engagements (page 47). This decline impacts the growth of remaining performance obligations (RPO), which stood at $63.4 billion as of January 31, 2025 (page 42). Since professional services are recognized as revenue when the services are performed (page 67), the reduced demand for these services directly affects the rate at which new RPO is added. This, in turn, influences future revenue recognition, as RPO represents contracted revenue yet to be recognized. Therefore, the drop in professional services revenue reflects a slower build-up of future revenue commitments, aligning with both the company's revenue recognition policy and the current RPO figures.",

Total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of January 31, 2025 was $14.0 billion.\n- Remaining Performance Obligation: Total remaining performance obligation, which represents all future revenue under contract yet to be recognized, as of January 31, 2025 was approximately $63.4 billion, an increase of 11 percent year-over-year. Current remaining performance obligation as of January 31, 2025 was approximately $30.2 billion, an increase of nine percent year-overyear.\n- Share Repurchase Program: During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we repurchased approximately 30 million shares of our common stock for approximately $7.8 billion.\n- Dividend Program : During the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025, we paid approximately $1.5 billion in dividends.\n\nIn the second half of fiscal 2025, we continued seeing increasing momentum for Agentforce and other AI service offerings. Outside of the demand for AI, the buying environment trends seen over the past two fiscal years have stabilized. A reemergence of slower growth in new and renewal business could impact our remaining performance obligation, revenues and our ability to meet financial guidance and long-term targets.\n\nIn addition, the ex panding global scope of our business and the heightened volatility of global markets expose us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Total revenues in the fiscal year ended January 31, 2025 were minimally impacted by foreign currency fluctuations compared to the fiscal year ended January 31, 2024. Our current remaining performance obligation growth as of January 31, 2025 compared to January 31, 2024 was negatively impacted by two percent compared to what would have been reported using constant currency rates. The impact of foreign currency fluctuations could impact our near-term results and ability to accurately predict our future results and earnings. The impact of these fluctuations can also be compounded by the seasonality of our business in which our fourth quarter has historically been our strongest quarter for new business and renewals.\n\n## Fiscal Year\n\nOur fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for ex ample, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\n\n## Operating Segments\n\nWe operate as one segment. See Note 1 'Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies' to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n\n## Sources of Revenues\n\nWe derive our revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues accounted for approximately 94 percent of our total revenues for fiscal 2025.\n\nSubscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing our enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, 'Cloud Services'), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses, and support revenues from the sale of support and updates beyond the basic subscription fees or related to the sales of software licenses. Our Cloud Services allow customers to use our multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Subscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer. Revenue from support and updates is recognized as such support and updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the contract term. Changes in contract duration for multi-year term software licenses can impact the amount of revenues recognized upfront. Revenues from term software licenses represent less than ten percent of total subscription and support revenue for fiscal 2025.\n\nThe revenue growth rates of each of our service offerings, as described below in 'Results of Operations,' fluctuate from quarter to quarter and over time. Additionally, we manage the total balanced product portfolio to deliver solutions to our customers and, as a result, the revenue result for each offering is not necessarily indicative of the results to be ex pected for any subsequent quarter. In addition, some of our Cloud Service offerings have similar features and functions. For example, customers may use our Sales, Service or Platform service offerings to record account and contact information, which are similar features across these service offerings. Depending on a customer's actual and projected business requirements, more than one service offering may satisfy the customer's current and future needs. We record revenue based on the individual products ordered by a customer, not according to the customer's business requirements and usage.\n\nOur growth in revenues is also impacted by attrition. Attrition represents the reduction or loss of the annualized value of our contracts with customers. We calculate our attrition rate at a point in time on a trailing twelve-month basis as of the end of each month. In general, we exclude service offerings from acquisitions from our attrition calculation until they are fully",

The Company monitors and manages the overall exposure of its cash balances to individual financial institutions on an ongoing basis. The Company's marketable securities portfolio consists primarily of investmentgrade securities and the Company's policies limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company does not require collateral for accounts receivable. The Company maintains an allowance for its doubtful accounts receivable for estimated credit losses. This allowance is based upon historical loss patterns, the number of days that billings are past due, an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with delinquent accounts and current market conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions to inform adjustments to historical loss patterns. The Company records the allowance against bad debt expense through the consolidated statements of operations, included in general and administrative expense, up to the amount of revenues recognized to date. Any incremental allowance is recorded as an offset to unearned revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Receivables are written off and charged against the recorded allowance when the Company has exhausted collection efforts without success.\n\nNo single customer accounted for ten percent or more of accounts receivable as of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024. No single customer accounted for ten percent or more of total revenue during fiscal 2025, 2024 and 2023. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located outside the Americas were 17 percent and 16 percent of total assets, respectively. As of January 31, 2025 and January 31, 2024, assets located in the United States were 81 percent and 82 percent of total assets, respectively.\n\nThe Company is also exposed to concentrations of risk in its strategic investment portfolio, including within specific industries, as the Company primarily invests in enterprise cloud companies, technology startups and system integrators. As of January 31, 2025, the Company held four investments, all privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its total strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 24 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate. As of January 31, 2024, the Company held two investments, both privately held, with carrying values that were individually greater than five percent of its strategic investments portfolio and represented approximately 16 percent of the portfolio in the aggregate.\n\n## Revenue Recognition\n\nThe Company derives its revenues from two sources: (1) subscription and support revenues and (2) professional services and other revenues. Subscription and support revenues include subscription fees from customers accessing the Company's enterprise cloud computing services (collectively, 'Cloud Services'), software license revenues from the sales of term software licenses and support revenues from the sales of support and updates beyond the basic subscription or software license sales. Professional services and other revenues include professional and advisory services for process mapping, project management and implementation services and training services.\n\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products and services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. If the consideration promised in a contract includes a variable amount, for example, overage fees, contingent fees or service level penalties, the Company includes an estimate of the amount it expects to receive for the total transaction price if it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur.\n\nThe Company determines the amount of revenue to be recognized through the application of the following steps:\n\n- identification of the contract, or contracts, with a customer;\n- identification of the performance obligations in the contract;\n- determination of the transaction price;\n- allocation of the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; and\n- recognition of revenue when or as the Company satisfies the performance obligations.\n\nSubscription and Support Revenues\n\nSubscription and support revenues are comprised of fees that provide customers with access to Cloud Services, software licenses and related support and updates during the term of the arrangement.\n\nCloud Services allow customers to use the Company's multi-tenant software without taking possession of the software. Revenue is generally recognized ratably over the contract term. Substantially all of the Company's subscription service arrangements are noncancellable and do not contain refund-type provisions.\n\nSubscription and support revenues also include revenues associated with term software licenses that provide the customer with a right to use the software as it exists when made available. Revenues from term software licenses are generally recognized",

      "question": "How do Salesforce's reported losses on strategic investments over the last three fiscal years, as shown in the income statement, align with their cash flow activities and accounting policies regarding the valuation of these investments?",
      "answer": "Salesforce reported losses on strategic investments of $121M, $277M, and $239M in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 respectively. These losses are non-cash adjustments in the cash flow statement, where they are added back to net income when calculating net cash provided by operating activities. The accounting policy note indicates that the valuation of these privately-held strategic investments involves significant management estimates, which may impact the reported losses and their alignment with cash flows.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## 1. Summary of Business and Significant Accounting Policies\n\n## Description of Business\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (the 'Company') is a global leader in customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together. With the deeply unified Salesforce Platform, the Company delivers a single source of truth, connecting customer data with integrated artificial intelligence ('AI') across systems, apps and devices to help companies sell, service, market and conduct commerce from anywhere. During the third quarter of fiscal 2025, the Company introduced Agentforce, a new layer of the trusted Salesforce Platform that enables companies to build and deploy AI agents that can respond to inputs, make decisions and take action autonomously across business functions. Agentforce includes a suite of customizable agents for use across sales, service, marketing and commerce. Since its founding in 1999, the Company has pioneered innovations in cloud, mobile, social, analytics and AI, enabling companies of every size and industry to transform their businesses in the digital-first world.\n\n## Fiscal Year\n\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on January 31. References to fiscal 2025, for example, refer to the fiscal year ending January 31, 2025.\n\n## Use of Estimates\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions in the Company's consolidated financial statements and notes thereto.\n\nSignificant estimates and assumptions made by management include the determination of:\n\n- the standalone selling price ('SSP') of performance obligations for revenue contracts with multiple performance obligations;\n- the valuation of privately-held strategic investments;\n- the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for business combinations;\n- the recognition, measurement and valuation of current and deferred income taxes and uncertain tax positions;\n- the useful lives of intangible assets; and\n- the fair value of certain stock awards issued.\n\nActual results could differ materially from these estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable, which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as well as income and expenses to be recognized.\n\n## Principles of Consolidation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n\n## Segments\n\nThe Company operates as one operating segment. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker ('CODM'), who is the Company's Chief Executive Officer, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. Over the past few years, the Company has completed a number of acquisitions which have allowed the Company to expand its offerings, presence and reach in various market segments of the enterprise cloud computing market. While the Company has offerings in multiple enterprise cloud computing market segments, including as a result of the Company's acquisitions, and operates in multiple countries, the Company's business operates in one operating segment because most of the Company's service offerings operate on the Salesforce Platform and are deployed in a nearly identical manner, and the Company's CODM evaluates the Company's financial information and resources, and assesses the performance of these resources, on a consolidated net income basis. Additionally, the measure of segment assets is reported on the balance sheet as total consolidated assets.\n\nThe Company's significant segment expenses, which are the expenses included in operating income as well as losses on strategic investments, and other segment items, which includes other income (expense) and benefit from (provision for) income taxes, are included in the Company's consolidated statement of operations. Additionally, further components of the Company's measure of profit or loss, which is net income, are included throughout the Company's financial statements.\n\n## Salesforce, Inc.\n\n## Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements",

      "question": "How does Cisco's treatment of financed service contracts in its credit risk disclosures align with the growth trends in these contracts and the corresponding credit loss provisions over fiscal year 2022?",
      "answer": "Cisco's financed service contracts grew significantly from $1,480 million in fiscal year 2021 to $2,186 million in 2022, as shown in the detailed credit risk rating table. Despite this growth, the allowance for credit losses on these contracts remained constant at $3 million throughout the year, with no provisions or adjustments recorded. This suggests that while Cisco expanded its exposure to financed service contracts, it did not perceive an increase in credit risk associated with these contracts, which contrasts with the general trend of increasing provisions in other categories like loan receivables.",

        "Hop 1: CSCO(page_10) \u2192 Financed Service Contracts: Identified as a distinct category of financial assets subject to Cisco's credit risk exposure.",

        "Hop 3: CSCO(page_85) \u2192 Financed Service Contracts: Disclosed that the allowance for credit losses on these contracts remained unchanged at $3 million for the entire fiscal year 2022, with no provisions or write-offs."

      "question": "How does Cisco's treatment of firm noncancelable commitments in the context of supply chain risk, inventory management strategy, and financial obligations reflect both the strategic necessity and financial exposure associated with these commitments?",
      "answer": "Cisco's firm noncancelable commitments are presented as a strategic tool to secure supply and pricing for critical components over multi-year periods, particularly in the face of supply chain constraints (page_52). However, these commitments also carry financial risk, as Cisco records liabilities for commitments exceeding demand forecasts, aligning with excess and obsolete inventory valuation practices (page_55). Additionally, these commitments are described as a significant portion of the company\u2019s purchase obligations, highlighting their materiality in managing manufacturing lead times and ensuring adequate component supply (page_93). Together, these perspectives show that while firm noncancelable commitments are essential for supply chain stability, they also expose Cisco to financial obligations that must be carefully balanced against demand forecasting and inventory risk.",

Under these interest rate swaps, we receive fixed-rate interest payments and make interest payments based on LIBOR plus a fixed number of basis points. The effect of such swaps is to convert the fixed interest rates of the senior fixed-rate notes to floating interest rates based on LIBOR. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are included in interest expense and substantially offset changes in the fair value of the hedged portion of the underlying debt that are attributable to the changes in market interest rates.\n\n## (e) Equity Price Risk\n\nWe hold marketable equity securities in our portfolio that are subject to price risk. To diversify our overall portfolio, we also hold equity derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges. The change in the fair value of each of these investment types are included in other income (loss), net.\n\nWe  are also exposed to variability in compensation charges related to certain deferred compensation obligations to employees. Although not designated as accounting hedges, we utilize derivatives such as total return swaps to economically hedge this exposure and offset the related compensation expense.\n\n## 14. Commitments and Contingencies\n\n## (a) Purchase Commitments with Contract Manufacturers and Suppliers\n\nWe purchase components from a variety of suppliers and use several contract manufacturers to provide manufacturing services for our  products.  During  the  normal  course  of  business,  in  order  to  manage  manufacturing  lead  times  and  help  ensure  adequate component supply, we enter into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments  arising  from  these  agreements  consists  of  firm,  noncancelable,  and  unconditional  commitments.  Certain  of  these inventory purchase commitments with contract manufacturers and suppliers relate to arrangements to secure supply and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods.

Our inventory purchase commitments are for short-term product manufacturing requirements as well as for commitments to suppliers to secure manufacturing capacity. Certain of  our  inventory  purchase  commitments  with  contract  manufacturers  and  suppliers  relate  to  arrangements  to  secure  supply  and pricing for certain product components for multi-year periods. A significant portion of our reported purchase commitments arising from these agreements are firm, noncancelable, and unconditional commitments. We record a liability for firm, noncancelable, and unconditional purchase commitments for quantities in excess of our future demand forecasts consistent with the valuation of our excess and obsolete inventory. See further discussion in 'Inventory Supply Chain.'\n\nOther Purchase Obligations Other purchase obligations represent an estimate of all contractual obligations in the ordinary course of  business,  other  than  operating  leases  and  commitments  with  contract  manufacturers  and  suppliers,  for  which  we  have  not received the goods or services. Purchase orders are not included in the preceding table as they typically represent our authorization to purchase rather than binding contractual purchase obligations.\n\nLong-Term  Debt The  amount  of  long-term  debt  in  the  preceding  table  represents  the  principal  amount  of  the  respective  debt instruments. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nTransition Tax Payable Transition tax payable represents future cash tax payments associated with the one-time U.S. transition tax on accumulated earnings for foreign subsidiaries as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ('the Tax Act').\n\nOther Long-Term Liabilities Other long-term liabilities primarily include noncurrent income taxes payable, accrued liabilities for deferred compensation, deferred tax liabilities, and certain other long-term liabilities. Due to the uncertainty in the timing of future payments,  our  noncurrent  income  taxes  payable  of  approximately  $2.3  billion  and  deferred  tax  liabilities  of  $55  million  were presented as one aggregated amount in the total column on a separate line in the preceding table. Noncurrent income taxes payable include uncertain tax positions. See Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Other Commitments\n\nIn connection with our acquisitions, we have agreed to pay certain additional amounts contingent upon the achievement of certain agreed-upon technology, development, product, or other milestones or the continued employment with us of certain employees of the acquired entities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe also have certain funding commitments primarily related to our privately held investments, some of which may be based on the achievement  of  certain  agreed-upon  milestones  or  are  required  to  be  funded  on  demand.  The  funding  commitments  were  $0.4 billion and $0.2 billion as of July 30, 2022 and July 31, 2021, respectively.\n\nIn the ordinary course of business, we have privately held investments and provide financing to certain customers. Certain of these investments are considered to be variable interest entities. We evaluate on an ongoing basis our privately held investments and customer  financings,  and  we  have  determined  that  as  of  July  30,  2022  there  were  no  material  unconsolidated  variable  interest entities.\n\nOn an ongoing basis, we reassess our privately held investments and customer financings to determine if they are variable interest entities and if we would be regarded as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance. As a result of this ongoing assessment, we may be required to make additional disclosures or consolidate these entities. Because we may not control these entities, we may not have the ability to influence these events.\n\nWe  provide  financing  guarantees,  which  are  generally  for  various  third-party  financing  arrangements  extended  to  our  channel partners. We could be called upon to make payments under these guarantees in the event of nonpayment by the channel partners. See the previous discussion of these financing guarantees under 'Financing Receivables and Guarantees.'\n\n## Liquidity and Capital Resource Requirements\n\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia and Ukraine war have not materially impacted our liquidity and capital resources to date, it has led to increased disruption and volatility in capital markets and credit markets. These events and resulting economic uncertainty  could  adversely  affect  our  liquidity  and  capital  resources  in  the  future.  Based  on  past  performance  and  current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, investments, cash generated from operations, and ability to access capital markets and committed credit lines will satisfy, through at least the next 12 months, our liquidity requirements, both in total and domestically,  including  the  following:  working  capital  needs  (including  inventory  and  other  supply  related  payments),  capital expenditures,  investment  requirements,  stock  repurchases,  cash  dividends,  contractual  obligations,  commitments,  principal  and interest payments on debt, pending acquisitions, future customer financings, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations.  We  expect  increased  payments  related  to  inventory  and  other  supply  related  payments  through  at  least  the  next  12 months.

      "question": "Given the volatility in sales to the service provider market mentioned in the risk factors, how does the regional product revenue performance in fiscal 2022, particularly in the Americas and EMEA, reflect the company's strategic positioning within this market, and what implications does this have for Cisco's broader go-to-market approach involving service providers as both customers and channel partners?",
      "answer": "The risk factors on page 22 highlight that sales to the service provider market are volatile, with recent declines in product orders, especially for routers and Secure, Agile Networks and Collaboration products, which could materially affect Cisco's operating results. Despite this, page 43 shows that the Americas segment saw a 5% increase in product revenue driven in part by growth in the service provider market, while EMEA saw an 8% increase, also driven by service provider demand. This suggests that, despite the inherent volatility, Cisco experienced growth in key regions from service provider sales during fiscal 2022. Page 9 further clarifies that service providers are not only end customers but also key channel partners who offer deployment and support services due to the complexity of their networks. This dual role implies that Cisco must balance the unpredictability of service provider purchasing with strategic reliance on them for broader market reach and service delivery, reinforcing the need for a resilient and adaptive go-to-market strategy.",

Service provider product orders decreased during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022 and in certain prior periods, and at various times in the past, including in recent quarters, we have experienced significant weakness in product orders from service providers. Product orders from the service provider market could continue to decline and, as has been the case in the past, such weakness could persist over extended periods of time given fluctuating market conditions. Sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of  expanding  network  infrastructures;  the  availability  of  funding;  and  the  extent  to  which  service  providers  are  affected  by regulatory, economic, and business conditions in the country of operations. Weakness in orders from this industry, including as a result  of  any  slowdown  in  capital  expenditures  by  service  providers  (which  may  be  more  prevalent  during  a  global  economic downturn,  or  periods  of  economic,  political  or  regulatory  uncertainty),  could  have  a  material  adverse  effect  on  our  business, operating results, and financial condition. Such slowdowns may continue or recur in future periods. Orders from this industry could decline for many reasons other than the competitiveness of our products and services within their respective markets. For example, in  the  past,  many  of  our  service  provider  customers  have  been  materially  and  adversely  affected  by  slowdowns  in  the  general economy, by overcapacity, by changes in the service provider market, by regulatory developments, and by constraints on capital availability,  resulting  in  business  failures  and  substantial  reductions  in  spending  and  expansion  plans.  These  conditions  have materially harmed our business and operating results in the past, and could affect our business and operating results in any future period.  Finally,  service  provider  customers  typically  have  longer  implementation  cycles;  require  a  broader  range  of  services, including design services; demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks; often require acceptance provisions, which can lead to a delay in revenue recognition; and expect financing from vendors. All these factors can add further risk to business conducted with service providers.\n\n## Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins.\n\nIf  we  fail  to  manage  distribution  of  our  products  and  services  properly,  or  if  our  distributors'  financial  condition  or  operations weaken, our revenue and gross margins could be adversely affected. A substantial  portion  of  our  products  and  services  is  sold through  our  channel  partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Our  channel  partners  include  systems  integrators, service providers, other resellers, and distributors. Systems integrators and service providers typically sell directly to end users and often provide system installation, technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network",

These  include  the  size  of  the organization,  number  and  types  of  technology  systems,  geographic  location,  and  business  applications  deployed  throughout  the customer's  network.  Our  customer  base  is  not  limited  to  any  specific  industry,  geography,  or  market  segment.  Our  customers primarily operate in the following markets: enterprise, commercial, service provider, and public sector.\n\n## Enterprise\n\nEnterprise businesses are large regional, national, or global organizations with multiple locations or branch offices. Many enterprise businesses have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multivendor environment. We offer service and support packages,  financing,  and  managed  network  services,  primarily  through  our  service  provider  partners.  We  sell  these  products through  a  network  of  third-party  application  and  technology  vendors  and  channel  partners,  as  well  as  selling  directly  to  these customers.\n\n## Commercial\n\nThe  commercial  market  represents  larger,  or  midmarket  and  small  businesses.  We  sell  to  our  midmarket  customers  through  a combination of our direct sales force and channel partners. These customers typically require the latest advanced technologies that our enterprise customers demand, but with less complexity. Small businesses require information technologies and communications products  that  are  easy  to  configure,  install,  and  maintain.  We  sell  to  these  smaller  organizations  within  the  commercial  market primarily through channel partners.\n\n## Service Providers\n\nService  providers  offer  data,  voice,  video,  and  mobile/wireless  services  to  businesses,  governments,  utilities,  and  consumers worldwide. The service provider market includes regional, national, and international wireline carriers, webscale operators as well as  Internet,  cable,  and  wireless  providers.  We  also  include  media,  broadcast,  and  content  providers  within  our  service  provider market,  as  the  lines  in  the  telecommunications  industry  continue  to  blur  between  traditional  network-based,  content-based  and application-based services. Service providers use a variety of our products and services for their own networks. In addition, many service providers use Cisco data center, virtualization, and collaboration technologies to offer managed or Internet-based services to their business customers. Compared with other customers, service providers are more likely to require network design, deployment, and support services because of the greater scale and higher complexity of their networks, whose requirements are addressed, we believe, by our architectural approach.\n\n## Public Sector\n\nThe public sector market includes federal, state and local governments, as well as educational institution customers. Many public sector customers have unique IT, collaboration, and networking needs within a multi-vendor environment. We sell to public sector customers through a network of third-party application and technology vendors, channel partners, as well as through direct sales.\n\n## Sales Overview\n\nAs of the end of fiscal 2022, our worldwide sales and marketing functions consisted of approximately 26,000 employees, including managers, sales representatives, and technical support personnel. We sell our products and services both directly and through a variety of channels with support from our salesforce. A substantial portion of our products and services is sold through channel partners,  and  the  remainder  is  sold  through  direct  sales.  Channel  partners  include  systems  integrators,  service  providers,  other resellers, and distributors.\n\nSystems  integrators  and  service  providers  typically  sell  directly  to  end  users  and  often  provide  system  installation,  technical support, professional services, and other support services in addition to network equipment sales. Systems integrators also typically integrate our products into an overall solution. Some service providers are also systems integrators.\n\nDistributors may hold inventory and sell to systems integrators, service providers, and other resellers. We refer to sales through distributors as our two-tier system of sales to the end customer. Revenue from two-tier distributors is recognized based on a sell-in method. These distributors may be given business terms that allow them to return a limited portion of inventory, receive credits for changes in selling prices, receive certain rebates, and participate in various cooperative marketing programs.\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  related  to  our  sales  channels,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors  entitled 'Disruption of or changes in our distribution model could harm our sales and margins' and 'Inventory management relating to our sales to our two-tier distribution channel is complex, and excess inventory may harm our gross margins.'\n\nFor  information  regarding  risks  relating  to  our  international  operations,  see  'Item  1A.  Risk  Factors,'  including  the  risk  factors entitled 'Our operating results may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions and the uncertain",

      "question": "Given the declining revenue trend in the Collaboration segment from fiscal year 2021 to 2022, how does Cisco's revenue recognition policy for SaaS and perpetual software offerings in this segment align with its overall product revenue performance and strategic positioning?",
      "answer": "Cisco's Collaboration segment revenue declined from $4,727 million in fiscal year 2021 to $4,472 million in fiscal year 2022, a 5% decrease. According to the revenue recognition policy, perpetual software and hardware revenue in the Collaboration segment is recognized upfront, while SaaS arrangements are recognized ratably over time. This recognition method aligns with the broader product revenue performance, where the segment experienced a decline, suggesting that neither upfront nor recurring revenue streams were sufficient to offset the overall drop in revenue. This decline raises questions about the segment's strategic positioning and growth potential, especially when compared to other segments showing growth like Internet for the Future (17%) and End-to-End Security (9%).",

      "question": "How does Oracle's declining hardware profitability, as noted in the risk factors, align with its strategic emphasis on Oracle Engineered Systems within the hardware business and the role of hardware in supporting cloud and on-premise infrastructure deployments?",
      "answer": "Oracle's hardware business faces declining revenues and profitability due to supply chain disruptions, inventory risks, and a strategic shift away from lower-margin commodity products toward more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems, such as the Oracle Exadata Database Machine. This strategic emphasis is evident in the MD&A section, where hardware is described as a core component of both cloud and on-premise infrastructure offerings. Despite these strategic priorities, the business remains vulnerable to external shocks, such as the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on global supply chains, which have caused manufacturing delays and increased inventory risk, further pressuring margins. The integration of hardware with cloud and on-premise infrastructure highlights its foundational role in Oracle\u2019s broader technology stack, even as its financial performance remains challenged.",

Increased  customer  demand  for  these  services,  without  corresponding  revenues,  could increase  costs  and  adversely  affect  our  operating  results.  Any  failure  to  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  or  a  market perception  that  we  do  not  maintain  high-quality  technical  support,  could  adversely  affect  our  reputation,  our  ability  to  sell  and renew our applications and infrastructure offerings to existing and prospective customers, and our business, operating results, and financial position.\n\nOur cloud offerings and hardware offerings are complex, and if we cannot successfully manage this complexity, including the sourcing  of  technologies  and  components,  the  results  of  these  businesses  will  suffer. We  depend  on  suppliers  to  develop, manufacture and deliver on a timely basis the necessary technologies and components for our hardware products that we market and sell to our customers and that we use as a part of our cloud infrastructure to deliver our cloud offerings, and there are some technologies and components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price, quality, technology, availability or other business constraints. Our supply chain operations have been, and likely will continue to be, negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and could also be disrupted by industry consolidation and component constraints or shortages, natural disasters, political unrest,  other  public  health  crises,  changes  to  trade  policies,  port  stoppages  or  other  transportation  disruptions  or  slowdowns,  or other factors affecting the countries or regions where these single source component vendors are located or where the products are being shipped. If one or more of the risks described above occurs, our cloud and license business and hardware business and related operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\n\nWe are susceptible to third-party manufacturing and logistics delays, which could result in the loss of sales and customers. We outsource a majority of our manufacturing, assembly, delivery and technology of, and certain component designs for, our hardware products  to  a  variety  of  companies,  many  of  which  are  located  outside  the  U.S.  From  time  to  time,  these  partners  experience production problems, delays or cannot meet our demand for products. The conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic created, and likely will continue to create, delays in our supply chain. Third-party manufacturing and logistics delays attributable to the effects of COVID-19 caused delays in the manufacturing and fulfilment of certain customer orders during fiscal 2022. Ongoing or future delays in manufacturing could cause the loss of additional sales, delayed revenue recognition or an increase in our hardware products expenses, all of which could adversely affect the margins of our cloud and license business and hardware business. These challenges could arise if we alter our manufacturing strategies, suppliers, or locations.\n\nOur hardware revenues and profitability have declined and could continue to decline. Our hardware business may adversely affect our total revenues and overall profitability and related growth rates. We may not achieve our estimated revenue, profit or other financial projections with respect to our hardware business in a timely manner or at all due to a number of factors, including:\n\n- our focus on certain of our more profitable Oracle Engineered Systems and certain other hardware products we consider strategic and the de-emphasis of certain of our lower profit margin commodity hardware products;\n- changes in strategies and frequency for the development and introduction of new versions or next generations of our hardware products;\n- decreased customer demand for related hardware support as hardware products approach the end of their useful lives; and\n- general supply chain material shortages worldwide, which were further exacerbated globally as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nSupply chain shortages have in some instances resulted in increases to the costs of production of our hardware products that we may not be able to pass on to our customers. In addition, we have in some instances responded to such shortages by committing to higher inventory purchases and balances relative to our historical positions in order to secure manufacturing capacity, which has in some instances increased inventory excess and obsolescence risk and adversely impacted our operating cash flows.\n\nOur periodic workforce restructurings and reorganizations can be disruptive. We are currently restructuring our workforce and in the past we have restructured or made other adjustments to our workforce in response to management changes, product changes, performance issues, changes in strategies, acquisitions and other internal",

This overview is followed by a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe  are  important  to  understanding  the  assumptions  and  judgments  incorporated  in  our  reported  financial  results.  We  then provide a more detailed analysis of our results of operations and financial condition for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. A discussion  regarding  our  financial  condition  and  results  of  operations  for  fiscal  2021  compared  to  fiscal  2020  can  be  found  in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2021, as filed with the SEC on June 21, 2021, which is available free of charge on the SEC's website at www.sec.gov and on our Investor Relations website at www.oracle.com/investor.\n\n## Business Overview\n\nOracle provides products and services that address enterprise information technology (IT) environments. Our products and services include  enterprise  applications  and  infrastructure  offerings  that  are  delivered  worldwide  through  a  variety  of  flexible  and interoperable  IT  deployment  models.  These  models  include  on-premise  deployments,  cloud-based  deployments,  and  hybrid deployments  (an  approach  that  combines  both  on-premise  and  cloud-based  deployments).  Accordingly,  we  offer  choice  and flexibility to our customers and facilitate the product, service and deployment combinations that best suit our customers' needs. Through our worldwide sales force and Oracle Partner Network, we sell to customers all over the world including businesses of many sizes, government agencies, educational institutions and resellers.\n\nWe have three businesses: cloud and license; hardware; and services; each of which comprises a single operating segment. The descriptions set forth below as a part of this Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  and  the  information  contained  within  Item  1  Business  and  Note  14  of  Notes  to  Consolidated  Financial  Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report provide additional information related to our businesses and operating segments and align to how our chief operating decision makers (CODMs), which include our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Technology Officer, view our operating results and allocate resources.\n\n## Cloud and License Business\n\nOur  cloud  and  license  business,  which  represented  85%  and  84%  of  our  total  revenues  in  fiscal  2022  and  2021,  respectively, markets, sells and delivers a broad spectrum of enterprise applications and infrastructure technologies through our cloud and license offerings. Revenue streams included in our cloud and license business are:\n\n- Cloud services and license support revenues, which include:\n- o license  support  revenues,  which  are  earned  by  providing  Oracle  license  support  services  to  customers  that  have elected  to  purchase  support  services  in  connection  with  the  purchase  of  Oracle  applications  and  infrastructure software  licenses  for  use  in  cloud,  on-premise  and  other  IT  environments.  Substantially  all  license  support customers  renew  their  support  contracts  with  us  upon  expiration  in  order  to  continue  to  benefit  from  technical support services and the periodic issuance of unspecified updates and enhancements, which current license support customers are entitled to receive. License support contracts are generally priced as a percentage of the net fees paid by the customer to purchase a cloud license and/or on-premise license; are generally billed in advance of the support services being performed; are generally renewed at the customer's option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual period that the support services are provided, which is generally one year; and\n- o cloud  services  revenues,  which  provide  customers  access  to  Oracle  Cloud  applications  and  infrastructure technologies via cloud-based deployment  models  that Oracle develops, provides unspecified  updates  and enhancements for, deploys, hosts, manages and supports and that",

Oracle Middleware is designed to enable  customers  to  design  and  integrate  Oracle  and  non-Oracle  business  applications,  automate  business  processes,  scale applications  to  meet  customer  demand,  simplify  security  and  compliance,  manage  lifecycles  of  documents  and  get  actionable, targeted  business  intelligence.  Built  with  Oracle's  Java  technology  platform,  Oracle  Middleware  products  are  designed  to  be flexible  across  different  deployment  environments-cloud,  on-premise  or  hybrid-as  a  foundation  for  custom,  packaged  and composite applications, thereby simplifying and reducing time to deployment. Oracle Middleware is designed to protect customers' IT  investments  and  work  with  both  Oracle  and  non-Oracle  database,  middleware  and  applications  software  through  an  open architecture  and  adherence  to  industry  standards.  In  addition,  Oracle  Middleware  supports  multiple  development  languages  and tools, which enables developers to flexibly build once and deploy applications globally across websites, portals and cloud-based applications utilizing a variety of IT environments.\n\nAmong our other middleware license offerings, we license development tools, such as Oracle WebLogic Server for Java application development, and Oracle Identity Manager, which automates user identity provisioning and allows enterprises to manage the endto-end lifecycle of user identities across all enterprise resources. Organizations may elect to purchase license support, as described above, for Oracle Middleware licenses at their option. We also offer certain of our middleware capabilities as a part of our OCI offerings.\n\n## Java Licenses\n\nJava  is  the  world's  most  popular  programming  language  that  is  used  to  deliver  cloud  development  and  deployment  services, microservices,  analytics,  data  management,  blockchain,  security,  and  continuous  integration  tools  for  numerous  platforms  and technologies including websites, enterprise and consumer applications, embedded devices and large-scale systems. Java is designed to enable developers to write software on a single platform and run it on many other different platforms, independent of operating system  and  hardware  architecture.  Java  has  been  adopted  by  both  independent  software  vendors  (ISVs)  that  have  built  their products using Java and by enterprise organizations building custom applications or consuming Java-based ISV products. Oracle is the steward of the Java platform and ecosystem. Customers generally purchase Java offerings through subscriptions that include licenses and support services. Oracle's Java offerings are used by customers to support their Java deployments and to stay current with the latest security updates and other technology innovations.\n\n## Oracle Infrastructure Technologies - Hardware Business Offerings\n\nOracle infrastructure technologies are also marketed, sold and delivered through our hardware business, including a broad selection of hardware products and related hardware support services to power cloud-based and on-premise IT environments.\n\n## Oracle Engineered Systems\n\nOracle  Engineered  Systems  are  core  to  our  cloud-based  and  on-premise  data  center  infrastructure  offerings.  Oracle  Engineered Systems  are  pre-integrated  products,  combining  multiple  unique  Oracle  technology  components,  including  database,  storage, operating system, and management software with server, storage, networking hardware and other technologies. Oracle Engineered Systems are designed to work together to deliver improved performance, scalability, availability, security and operational efficiency relative  to  our  competitors'  products;  to  be  upgraded  effectively  and  efficiently  in  a  non-disruptive  manner;  and  to  simplify maintenance  cycles  and  improve  security  by  providing  a  single  solution  for  patching.  For  example,  Oracle  Exadata  Database Machine is an integrated platform that is optimized for running Oracle Database, achieving higher performance, scalability and availability at a lower cost by combining Oracle Database, storage and operating system software with Oracle server, storage and networking hardware. We offer certain of our Oracle Engineered Systems, including the Oracle Exadata Database Machine, among others, through flexible deployment options, including on-premise, as a cloud offering in OCI, and as a hybrid cloud offering in customer data centers.",

      "question": "How did Oracle's fiscal 2022 operating asset sales, including the $250 million in gains, influence its research and development expenses and overall operating margin, given the litigation-related charges and the reduced emphasis on non-strategic hardware products?",
      "answer": "Oracle's fiscal 2022 operating asset sales generated $250 million in gains, which were allocated across most operating expense lines, including research and development (R&D) expenses. This allocation helped offset the increase in R&D costs, which rose due to higher employee-related expenses and stock-based compensation. Despite these gains, Oracle's total operating margin still declined compared to fiscal 2021, largely due to significant litigation-related charges that outweighed the benefits from the asset sale gains and higher segment margins. Additionally, the reduced emphasis on non-strategic hardware products contributed to a strategic realignment that affected revenue and cost structures, further influencing the operating margin. Thus, while the asset sales provided some financial relief, they were insufficient to fully counterbalance the negative impact of litigation costs and business model adjustments.",

The constant currency increase in our cloud and license business' revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was attributable  to  growth  in  our  cloud  services  and  license  support  revenues  and  cloud  license  and  on-premise  license  revenues  as customers purchased our applications and infrastructure technologies via cloud and license deployment models. Customers also renewed  their  related  cloud  contracts  and  license  support  contracts  to  continue  to  gain  access  to  the  latest  versions  of  our technologies and to receive support services. The constant currency increase in our services business' revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was attributable to an increase in revenues for each of our primary services offerings. The constant currency decrease in our hardware business' revenues during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal 2021 was due to the emphasis we placed on the marketing and sale of our growing cloud-based infrastructure technologies and the de-emphasis of our sales and marketing efforts for certain of our non-strategic hardware products and related support services. In constant currency, the Americas, EMEA and Asia Pacific regions contributed 68%, 22% and 10%, respectively, to our total revenue growth during fiscal 2022.\n\nExcluding the effects of foreign currency rate fluctuations, our total operating expenses increased during fiscal 2022 relative to fiscal  2021  substantially  due  to  certain  litigation  related  charges  recorded  to  acquisition  related  and  other  expenses  as  further described in Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In addition, our total operating  expenses  increased  due  to  higher  cloud  services  and  license  support  expenses,  which  were  primarily  due  to  higher employee related expenses and infrastructure investments that were made to support the increase in our cloud and license business' revenues; higher services expenses, which increased primarily due to higher employee related and external contractor expenses; and higher research and development and general and administrative expenses, both of which increased primarily due to higher employee related expenses.

      "answer": "Oracle's Cloud Services and License Support Expenses rose to $4,915 million in fiscal 2022 (from $4,133 million in fiscal 2021), reflecting a 19% year-over-year increase. This aligns with the growth in cloud and license revenues, which totaled $36,052 million in fiscal 2022, with the Americas contributing 57% of total revenues and showing a 10% growth. The company's strategic focus on direct sales and cloud delivery models, as described in the narrative section on the cloud and license business, supports the need for increased investment in cloud infrastructure and support personnel, which are cited as key cost components in cloud services and license support expenses.

License  support  revenues  are  typically  generated  through  the  sale  of applications and infrastructure license support contracts related to cloud licenses and on-premise licenses; are purchased by our customers at their option; and are generally recognized as revenues ratably over the contractual term, which is generally one year. Our cloud services deliver applications and infrastructure technologies on a subscription basis via cloud-based deployment models that  we  develop, provide unspecified updates and enhancements for, deploy, host, manage and support. Revenues for our cloud services are generally recognized over the contractual term, which is generally one to three years, or in the case of usage model contracts, as the cloud services are consumed. Cloud license and on-premise license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers  licenses,  generally  on  a  perpetual  basis,  to  use  our  database  and  middleware  and  our  applications  software  products within cloud and on-premise IT environments and are generally recognized up front at the point in time when the software is made available to the customer to download and use. We continue to place significant emphasis, both domestically and internationally, on direct  sales  through  our  own  sales  force.  We  also  continue  to  market  certain  of  our  offerings  through  indirect  channels.  Costs associated with our cloud and license business are included in cloud services and license support expenses, and sales and marketing expenses. These costs are largely personnel and infrastructure related including the cost of providing our cloud services and license support offerings, salaries and commissions earned by our sales force for the sale of our cloud and license offerings, and marketing program costs.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's growth in Cloud and License Revenues in fiscal 2022 compare to prior years, and what does the reconciliation of segment revenues to consolidated revenues reveal about the impact of acquisition accounting on reported performance?",
      "answer": "Oracle's Cloud and License Revenues grew from $34,101 million in fiscal 2021 to $36,052 million in fiscal 2022, a 6% increase. This growth was driven by increases across regions, with the Americas growing 10%, while EMEA and Asia Pacific each grew 1%. The growth in fiscal 2022 follows a similar trend from fiscal 2020 to 2021, where revenues increased from $32,523 million to $34,101 million. However, the reconciliation note on page 106 reveals that prior-year segment revenues included obligations from acquired businesses that were not recognized in consolidated revenues due to acquisition accounting rules. This suggests that the reported segment growth may not fully reflect GAAP-consolidated performance, as certain revenues recognized in segment reporting were not recorded in consolidated results prior to fiscal 2022.",

      "answer": "iPad sales declined by 6% in 2024, dropping from $28.3 billion in 2023 to $26.694 billion in 2024. This decline was partially attributed to weaker performance in the Greater China region, where iPad sales contributed to the overall decrease in net sales. Despite this, Apple's total net sales increased by 2% globally, indicating that the iPad's contraction was offset by growth in other product lines and services, particularly in regions like the Americas and Europe.",

      "answer": "As of September 28, 2024, Apple reported $35.228 billion in current marketable securities, compared to $31.590 billion in the prior fiscal year (2023). Of the 2024 total, $13.2 billion was specifically classified as related to restricted escrow funds tied to the European Commission state aid decision. This indicates a significant increase in the value of current marketable securities year-over-year, with a notable portion linked to a specific legal and tax-related contingency.",

The State A id Decision ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be \u20ac13.1 billion, plus interest of \u20ac1.2 billion.\n\nFrom time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish M inister for Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries. A s of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of \u20ac12.7 billion plus interest of \u20ac1.2 billion was held in escrow and restricted from general use. The total balance of the escrow, including net unrealized investment gains, was \u20ac14.2 billion or $15.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, of which $2.6 billion was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $13.2 billion was classified as current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and M arketable Securities section of Note 4, 'Financial Instruments' for more information.",

      "question": "What is the full composition and trend of Apple's 'Other Non-Current Liabilities' in 2024 when considering their lease obligations, general balance sheet presentation, and separate disclosure of income tax liabilities?",
      "answer": "Apple's 'Other Non-Current Liabilities' totaled $45,888 million in 2024 according to the general balance sheet (page_34). This figure includes $36,634 million specifically attributed to income taxes payable (page_42), indicating a significant portion of the liabilities are tax-related. Additionally, within lease obligations, $10,046 million of operating lease liabilities and $752 million of finance lease liabilities are classified under 'Other Non-Current Liabilities' (page_45), summing to $10,798 million. Together, these figures suggest that while income taxes dominate this liability category, lease obligations also contribute meaningfully to the overall balance.",

      "question": "What explains the stability in Professional Services and Other Revenue as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal 2024 despite a decline in absolute dollar contribution compared to fiscal 2023, and how does this trend relate to both the gross profit performance and cost structure changes across the same period?",
      "answer": "Professional Services and Other Revenue remained stable at 7% of total revenues in both fiscal 2023 and 2024 (page_48), despite a $11 million decline in absolute revenue from $2,331 million to $2,320 million in fiscal 2024 (page_49). However, the cost of this revenue also decreased by $175 million from $2,539 million to $2,364 million (page_50), contributing to an improved gross profit margin. This cost reduction aligns with broader efficiency efforts reflected in the total cost of revenues, which only increased by $181 million despite a $3,505 million rise in total revenues. Thus, while the segment's revenue contribution was flat as a percentage, its cost efficiency improved, supporting the overall gross profit increase from 73% to 75% (page_48).",

        "Hop 1: [CRM](page_49) \u2192 [Professional Services and Other Revenue]: Shows a slight decline in absolute revenue from $2,331 million (2023) to $2,320 million (2024), indicating flat performance in dollar terms.",

      "answer": "Subscription and Support Revenue grew from $29,021 million in fiscal 2023 to $32,537 million in fiscal 2024, a 12% increase. The cost of subscription and support revenue remained relatively stable as a percentage of total revenues, decreasing slightly from 19% in fiscal 2023 to 18% in fiscal 2024. This contributed to an improvement in gross profit, which rose from $22,992 million (73% of total revenues) in fiscal 2023 to $26,316 million (75% of total revenues) in fiscal 2024. These trends suggest that Salesforce improved its profitability and cost efficiency in managing subscription and support revenue year-over-year.",

      "question": "How does the sustained growth in CRM's subscription and support revenues, driven by new business and consistent attrition rates, align with the seasonal billing patterns and the company's remaining performance obligation figures?",
      "answer": "CRM's subscription and support revenues grew due to volume-driven increases from new business, including new customers, upgrades, and additional subscriptions, accounting for approximately 93% of total revenues in fiscal 2024 (page 49). This growth has been supported by consistent attrition rates, which have remained stable compared to the prior year, helping maintain revenue predictability (page 45). Meanwhile, the seasonal nature of billing, with a disproportionate weighting toward the fourth quarter, influences the timing of revenue recognition and cash flows. This seasonality also affects the remaining performance obligation, which stood at $56.9 billion as of January 31, 2024, reflecting all future revenue under contract yet to be recognized (page 44). Together, these factors indicate that CRM's revenue growth is underpinned by strong new business acquisition, low churn, and a lumpy but growing forward-looking revenue base shaped by annual billing cycles.",

      "answer": "Salesforce incurred approximately $541 million in employee transition costs as part of their restructuring initiatives, which are included in both accrued liabilities on the balance sheet and operating expenses in the income statement. These costs contributed to a 20% reduction in general and administrative headcount during fiscal 2024. The costs are disclosed in accounts payable and accrued expenses on the balance sheet and are also reflected in the restructuring charges within operating expenses, specifically under employee-related costs including stock-based compensation. This indicates that the company recognized both immediate cash outflows and long-term liability commitments tied to workforce reductions.",

This aligns with the risks outlined in the filing, where international environmental regulations such as the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive and China's pollution control regulations are flagged as potential cost drivers and revenue impediments. These regulations may increase compliance costs and impact sales in key markets like the EU and China.

If violations of law are found, they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business.\n\nEnvironmental and other related laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs. Our cloud and hardware operations are subject to state, federal and international laws governing protection of the environment, proper handling and disposal of materials used for these operations, human health and safety, the use of certain chemical substances and the labor practices of suppliers, as well as local testing and labeling requirements. Regulatory, market, carbon tax and competitive pressures regarding the greenhouse gas emissions and energy mix for our data center operations may also grow.\n\nApproximately half of our hardware revenues come from international sales. Environmental legislation, such as the EU Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, China's regulation on Management Methods for Controlling Pollution Caused by Electronic Information Products and the EU carbon border adjustment mechanism, among others, may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our hardware revenues from the EU, China and other countries with similar environmental legislation as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements. Compliance with these ever-changing environmental and other laws in a timely manner could increase our product design, development, procurement, manufacturing, delivery, cloud operations, i nsurance premiums and administration costs, limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non-compliant inventory, change our sales activities, or otherwise impact future financial results of our cloud and hardware businesses. Any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability, including fi nes, penalties and possible prohibition of sales of our products and services into one or more states or countries and result in a material adverse effect on the fi nancial condition or operations of our cloud and hardware businesses.\n\nThe Nomination and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors oversees and periodically reviews our environmental, social and governance (ESG) programs, including environmental sustainability. We also have an Environmental Steering Committee (ESC) comprised of senior individuals from a wide range of Oracle business units, including our Chief Sustainability Officer who oversees our overall sustainability strategy, including climate related risk mitigation. The ESC evaluates if climate or environmental risks have the potential for significant chronic or acute impact on our core and/or strategic business functions, i ncluding service delivery and support, product development and deployment, supply chain management, facility operations, employee recruitment and retention, or brand reputation. Any failure to identify and assess these risks could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance and growth.\n\nWe publish an annual Social Impact Report, which includes disclosure of our ESG matters and goals. Our disclosures on these matters, and standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards, may potentially harm our reputation and brand. By electing to set and share publicly these corporate ESG standards, our business may also face increased scrutiny related to ESG initiatives and activities.\n\nFurther, new laws, regulations, policies, and international accords relating to ESG matters, including sustainability, climate change, human capital and diversity, some of which require specific, target-driven frameworks or disclosure requirements, are being developed, formalized and implemented in many j urisdictions. Standards for reporting ESG metrics, including ESG-related disclosures, are complex and evolving, and the implementation and oversight of controls to comply with applicable reporting and disclosure standards could impose significant compliance costs. In addition, such disclosure requirements could result in revisions to our previous ESG-related disclosure or challenges in meeting evolving and varied regulatory and other stakeholder expectations and standards, which could expose us to liability or harm our reputation and prospects.\n\n## Financial Risks\n\nOur operations can be difficult for us to predict because our quarterly results of operations may fluctuate significantly based on a number of factors. Our revenues, particularly certain of our cloud license and on-premise license revenues and hardware revenues, can be difficult to forecast. A substantial portion of our cloud license, on-premise license and hardware contracts is completed in the latter part of a quarter. Because a significant portion of our cost structure is l a rgely fixed in the short term, sales and revenue shortfalls tend to have a disproportionately negative impact on our profitability. We typically have a number of large transactions each quarter, which increases",

      "answer": "Oracle's Cloud License segment shows consistent deferred revenue balances of $52 million in both fiscal years 2024 and 2023 (page_92), indicating stability in long-term revenue commitments. However, the segment's reported revenues declined from $5,779 million in 2023 to $5,081 million in 2024 (page_68), suggesting a reduction in new license sales or recognition timing. Despite this revenue decline, the segment saw a significant increase in goodwill, rising from $57,060 million in 2023 to $57,072 million in 2024 (page_86), indicating ongoing strategic investment and consolidation within the segment. This combination of declining recognized revenue but stable deferred revenue and growing goodwill suggests Oracle continues to prioritize long-term positioning in the Cloud License space despite short-term revenue pressures.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's treatment of Acquisition Related and Other Expenses in fiscal 2024 reflect both operational changes and broader financial reporting considerations, especially considering the composition of these expenses, their exclusion from operating segment performance, and the comparison to prior fiscal years?",
      "answer": "Oracle's Acquisition Related and Other Expenses in fiscal 2024 reflect a narrower composition, primarily consisting of personnel-related transition costs and post-measurement period business combination adjustments, with no mention of litigation charges that were present in fiscal 2022. These expenses are explicitly excluded from the operating segment results (cloud and license, hardware, and services), indicating that management evaluates business performance without these costs, consistent with internal reporting practices. Additionally, the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal 2024, due to certain assets becoming fully amortized, indirectly suggests a reduced ongoing financial burden from past acquisitions, aligning with the current framing of these expenses as more transitional in nature rather than long-term operational costs.",

The first step is to determine if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained in an audit, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes. The second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement. Although we believe that we have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, no assurance can be given with respect to the final outcome of these matters. We adjust reserves for our uncertain tax positions due to changing facts and circumstances, such as the closing of a tax audit, j udicial rulings, and refinement of estimates or realization of earnings or deductions that differ from our estimates. To the extent that the final outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences generally will impact our provision for income taxes in the period in which such a determination is made. Our provisions for income taxes include the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate and also include the related interest and penalties.\n\n## Non-Marketable Investments\n\nWe assess our non-marketable debt and equity investments for credit losses and impairment on a quarterly basis and as facts and circumstances change. Our analysis includes an assessment of various qualitative and quantitative factors, including the investee's historical financial results, current financial projections, rate of cash usage and assumptions regarding product acceptance and opportunity within the market. This analysis requires significant judgment i n evaluating underlying factors. In some instances, investee specific information available to us to make this assessment may be limited or may be available on a delayed basis. If the investment is determined to be impaired, we adjust the carrying amount of such investment to its estimated fair value by recognizing a charge, which is included in non-operating expenses, net in our consolidated statements of operations. Estimating the fair value of an investment upon i mpairment involves a significant level of estimation, uncertainty and judgment. We may incur future losses due to impairments, which could have a material i mpact on our results of operations and financial position.\n\n## Results of Operations\n\n## Presentation of Operating Segment Results and Other Financial Information\n\nIn our results of operations discussion below, we provide an overview of our total consolidated revenues, total consolidated operating expenses and total consolidated operating margin, all of which are presented on a GAAP basis. We also present a GAAP-based discussion below for substantially all of the other expense items as presented in our consolidated statements of operations that are not directly attributable to our three businesses.\n\nIn addition, we discuss below the results of each of our three businesses-cloud and license, hardware and services-which are our operating segments as defined pursuant to ASC 280, Segment Reporting . The financial reporting for our three businesses that is presented below is presented in a manner that is consistent with that used by our CODMs. Our operating segment presentation below reflects revenues, direct costs and sales and marketing expenses that correspond to and are directly attributable to each of our three businesses. We also utilize these inputs to calculate and present a segment margin for each of our three businesses in the discussion below.\n\nConsistent with our internal management reporting processes, research and development expenses, general and administrative expenses, stock-based compensation expenses, amortization of intangible assets, certain other expense allocations, acquisition related and other expenses, restructuring expenses, i nterest expense, non-operating expenses, net and provision for income taxes are not attributed to our three operating segments because our management does not view the performance of our three businesses including such items and/or it is impracticable to do so. Refer to 'Supplemental Disclosure Related to Certain Charges' below for additional discussion of certain of these items and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report for a reconciliation of the summations of total segment margin as presented in the discussion below to total income before income taxes as presented per our consolidated statements of operations for fiscal 2024 and 2023.",

      "question": "How does Oracle's flat total margin percentage in fiscal 2024 reflect contrasting trends across its hardware, services, and cloud & license businesses, particularly regarding constant currency dynamics?",
      "answer": "Oracle's total margin percentage remained flat at 62% in fiscal 2024 compared to 59% in fiscal 2023 (page 51), but this stability masks contrasting segment-level dynamics. The hardware business saw a slight decline in total revenues (-6%) and a more significant drop in expenses (-14%), contributing to a marginal improvement in margin percentage (page 51). In contrast, the services business experienced a constant currency decrease in total revenues, which led to a decline in both total margin and margin percentage despite flat expenses (page 52). Meanwhile, the cloud and license business saw constant currency revenue growth driven by cloud services and support, which increased expenses but kept margin percentage flat due to scale (page 50). Thus, the overall stability in total margin percentage reflects offsetting forces across segments \u2014 cost reductions in hardware, revenue declines in services, and scalable growth in cloud and license.",

      "question": "How does the $10.2 billion desktop revenue figure from 2022 and its 9% volume decline through 2023 reconcile with the 2024 desktop revenue contraction cited as 'lower demand' and the broader CCG strategy that emphasizes notebook growth and legacy business exits?",
      "answer": "In 2022, desktop revenue stood at $10.2 billion, but it fell by 9% in volume terms in 2023 due to lower demand across market segments, despite some recovery in the second half of the year as inventory normalized. This downward trend continued into 2024, where desktop revenue is cited as being in decline due to 'lower demand' compared to 2023. Meanwhile, the CCG segment strategy has pivoted toward notebook growth, which saw a 4% revenue increase in 2024 driven by higher notebook volume, and the exit of legacy businesses contributing to the decline in 'other CCG revenue.' This persistent desktop revenue contraction across two years signals a strategic reassessment within CCG, shifting focus away from desktops toward notebooks and away from legacy offerings.",

Notebook revenue was $17.0 billion, down $1.8 billion from 2022. Notebook volume decreased 5% from 2022, driven by lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of 2023 as customer inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in the first half of 2023. Notebook A SPs decreased 5% from 2022 due to relative strength in the education market segment resulting in a higher mix of small core products combined with a higher mix of older generation products. Desktop revenue was $10.2 billion, down $495 million from 2022. Desktop volume decreased 9% from 2022, driven by lower demand across market segments, partially offset by increased volume in the second half of 2023 as customer inventory levels normalized compared to higher levels in the first half of 2023. Desktop A SPs increased 5% from 2022, due to an increased mix of product sales to the commercial and gaming market segments. Other CCG revenue was $2.1 billion, down $229 million from 2022, primarily driven by the continued ramp down of our legacy smartphone modem business and lower demand for our wireless and connectivity products as a result of lower notebook volumes.\n- DCAI revenue decreased $4.2 billion from 2022, driven by a decrease in server revenue. Server volume decreased 37% from 2022, due to lower demand in a softening CPU data center market. Server A SPs increased 20% from 2022, primarily due to a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products.\n- NEX revenue decreased $2.6 billion from 2022, as customers tempered purchases to reduce inventories and adjust to a lower demand environment across product lines.\n\n## Operating Segment Cost of Sales and Operating Expenses Summary\n\n## 2024 vs. 2023\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nTotal Intel Products cost of sales was $23.8 billion in 2024, down $303 million from 2023.\n\n- CCG cost of sales decreased $37 million from 2023, primarily driven by lower samples and lower cost of sales due to the exit of legacy businesses. These decreases were substantially offset by higher cost of sales due to higher unit cost from an increased mix of Intel 4 and Intel 7 products and higher notebook volume sold in 2024.\n- DCAI cost of sales increased $372 million from 2023, primarily driven by higher period charges due to $922 million in Gaudi A I accelerator inventoryrelated charges recognized in 2024, and higher server unit cost primarily driven by an increased mix of Intel 7 products sold in 2024. These cost of sales increases were partially offset by lower period charges driven by the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower non-accelerator inventory reserves taken in 2024.\n- NEX cost of sales decreased $638 million from 2023, primarily driven by lower period charges from the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower reserves taken in 2024.\n\n## Operating Expenses\n\nTotal Intel Products operating expenses were $11.9 billion, down $267 million from 2023.\n\n- CCG operating expenses decreased $338 million from 2023, primarily driven by intersegment credits and various cost-reduction measures taken in 2024.\n- DCAI operating expenses increased $92 million from 2023, primarily driven by increased product development costs in 2024, partially offset by various cost-reduction measures taken in 2024.\n- NEX operating expenses were roughly flat with 2023.\n\n## 2023 vs. 2022\n\n## Cost of Sales\n\nTotal Intel Products cost of sales was $24.1 billion in 2023, down $3.6 billion from 2022.\n\n- CCG cost of sales decreased $2.2 billion from 2022, primarily driven by lower period charges from the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower reserves taken in 2023, and lower notebook and desktop sales volume. These decreases in cost of sales were partially offset by higher unit costs primarily from an increased mix of Intel 7 products sold in 2023.\n- DCAI cost of sales decreased $661 million from 2022, primarily driven by lower server sales volume, lower sample costs, and lower period charges from the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower reserves taken in 2023. These cost of sales decreases were partially offset by higher unit cost primarily from an increased mix of Intel 7 products sold in 2023.\n- NEX cost of sales decreased $761 million from 2022, driven by lower sales volume across product lines, partially offset by higher period charges driven by inventory reserves taken in 2023.\n\nMD&amp;A",

Our customers primarily include OEM s, ODM s, cloud service providers, and other manufacturers and service providers, such as industrial and communication equipment manufacturers and other cloud service providers who buy our products through distributor, reseller, retail, and OEM  channels throughout the world. We market and sell these products directly through our global sales and marketing organizations and indirectly through channel partners. We manufacture our products at our fabrication and assembly and test facilities located throughout the world. We seek to expand our Intel Foundry business as a third-party foundry for external customers.\n\n## A Year in Rev iew\n\n2024 revenue was $53.1 billion, down $1.1 billion, or 2%, from 2023 due to lower all other revenue and lower Intel Foundry revenue, partially offset by higher Intel Products revenue. All other revenue decreased 32% from 2023, driven by lower A ltera revenue due to customers tempering purchases to reduce existing inventories across all product lines and lower M obileye revenue as customers tempered purchases to reduce existing inventories of EyeQ products. Intel Foundry external revenue decreased 60% from 2023 due to lower traditional packaging services and lower equipment sales. Intel Products revenue increased 3% from 2023 due primarily to higher CCG and DCAI revenue. CCG revenue increased 4% from 2023 primarily due to higher notebook volume compared to 2023 and was partially  offset by  lower other CCG rev enue, which decreased from 2023 due to the exit of legacy businesses, and lower desktop revenue, which decreased on lower demand compared to 2023. DCAI revenue increased 1% from 2023 driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations in 2024 were meaningfully impacted by non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, restructuring charges resulting from our 2024 Restructuring Plan, non-cash impairments of goodwill and certain other assets, as well as non-cash charges related to a valuation allowance recognized against our US deferred tax assets. In 2024, we invested $16.5 billion in R&amp;D, made gross capital investments of $25.1 billion, and had $8.3 billion in cash from operations and negative $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow . 1\n\nOur 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. In 2024, our previously announced internal foundry operating model took effect, creating a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and the Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry M anufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services, formerly IFS). The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of our internal foundry operating model, we began separately reporting the financials for our Intel Products and Intel Foundry businesses in Q1 2024 and, in Q3 2024, we announced our intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We also made meaningful progress on our previously announced plan to operate Altera  as a standalone business beginning in Q1 2024, readying the business and paving the way for value capture opportunities in early 2025. \u00ae\n\n## Restructuring\n\nIn 2024, we announced our intention to implement a series of cost and capital reduction initiatives designed to adjust our spending to current business trends while enabling our new operating model and continuing to fund investments in our core strategy-returning to product and process competitiveness. These initiativ es, which we refer to as our 2024 Restructuring Plan, include reducing headcount, consolidating and reducing our global real estate footprint, conducting portfolio rev iews of our businesses under a \"clean sheet\" view, rationalizing capital investments and deployments based upon demand signals and capacity requirements, and reducing our overall operating expenses. The headcount actions in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in an approximate 15% decrease in our core Intel workforce by early 2025. A s a result of initiating and deploying our 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in 2024.\n\nOur 2024 consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:\n\n- \u25a0 $3.3 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;\n- \u25a0 $3.1 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets (see \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and\n- \u25a0 $9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets (see \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Segments and Prior Year Results\n\nDuring 2024, we managed our business through the operating segments that are presented below and have included the 2024, 2023, and 2022 segment financial results and related discussions of our segments' results of operations. Our segments' results of operations presented below exclude the $7.0 billion of restructuring and other charges and $9.9 billion of charges resulting from valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets, in addition to certain other items, as our CODM s receive, view, and use information for decision-making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items.\n\nMD&amp;A\n\n13",

In 2024, we invested $16.5 billion in R&amp;D, made gross capital investments of $25.1 billion, and had $8.3 billion in cash from operations and negative $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow . 1\n\nOur 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. In 2024, our previously announced internal foundry operating model took effect, creating a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and the Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry M anufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services, formerly IFS).

DCAI revenue increased 1% from 2023 driven by higher server revenue primarily from high core count products, which increased ASPs and lowered volume compared to 2023.\n\nOur consolidated results of operations in 2024 were meaningfully impacted by non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, restructuring charges resulting from our 2024 Restructuring Plan, non-cash impairments of goodwill and certain other assets, as well as non-cash charges related to a valuation allowance recognized against our US deferred tax assets. In 2024, we invested $16.5 billion in R&amp;D, made gross capital investments of $25.1 billion, and had $8.3 billion in cash from operations and negative $2.2 billion of adjusted free cash flow . 1\n\nOur 2024 results reflect the continued advancement of our transformational journey. In 2024, our previously announced internal foundry operating model took effect, creating a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and the Intel Foundry business (including Foundry Technology Development, Foundry M anufacturing and Supply Chain, and Foundry Services, formerly IFS). The foundry operating model is designed to reshape operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. In furtherance of our internal foundry operating model, we began separately reporting the financials for our Intel Products and Intel Foundry businesses in Q1 2024 and, in Q3 2024, we announced our intent to establish Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We also made meaningful progress on our previously announced plan to operate Altera  as a standalone business beginning in Q1 2024, readying the business and paving the way for value capture opportunities in early 2025. \u00ae\n\n## Restructuring\n\nIn 2024, we announced our intention to implement a series of cost and capital reduction initiatives designed to adjust our spending to current business trends while enabling our new operating model and continuing to fund investments in our core strategy-returning to product and process competitiveness. These initiativ es, which we refer to as our 2024 Restructuring Plan, include reducing headcount, consolidating and reducing our global real estate footprint, conducting portfolio rev iews of our businesses under a \"clean sheet\" view, rationalizing capital investments and deployments based upon demand signals and capacity requirements, and reducing our overall operating expenses. The headcount actions in connection with the 2024 Restructuring Plan are expected to result in an approximate 15% decrease in our core Intel workforce by early 2025. A s a result of initiating and deploying our 2024 Restructuring Plan, we recognized restructuring charges of $2.8 billion in 2024.\n\nOur 2024 consolidated results of operations were also materially impacted by the following:\n\n- \u25a0 $3.3 billion of charges, substantially all of which were recorded to cost of sales, related to non-cash impairments and the acceleration of depreciation for certain manufacturing assets, a substantial majority of which related to our Intel 7 process node;\n- \u25a0 $3.1 billion of non-cash charges associated with the impairment of goodwill for certain of our reporting units as well as certain acquired intangible assets (see \"Note 7: Restructuring and Other Charges\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements); and\n- \u25a0 $9.9 billion of non-cash charges recorded to provision for income taxes that substantially related to valuation allowances recorded to our net deferred tax assets (see \"Note 8: Income Taxes\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## Segments and Prior Year Results\n\nDuring 2024, we managed our business through the operating segments that are presented below and have included the 2024, 2023, and 2022 segment financial results and related discussions of our segments' results of operations. Our segments' results of operations presented below exclude the $7.0 billion of restructuring and other charges and $9.9 billion of charges resulting from valuation allowances recorded against our net deferred tax assets, in addition to certain other items, as our CODM s receive, view, and use information for decision-making purposes based upon segment results that exclude such items.\n\nMD&amp;A\n\n13",

      "question": "How does Intel's segment revenue breakdown, consolidated financial results, and strategic overview collectively explain the $1.3 billion year-over-year decline in Altera revenue and its broader implications for the company's financial positioning in 2024?",
      "answer": "Intel's segment revenue data (page 23) shows that Altera revenue dropped to $1.5 billion in 2024 from $2.9 billion in 2023\u2014a $1.3 billion decrease\u2014driven by customers reducing purchases to lower existing inventories across all product lines. This decline is reflected in the consolidated revenue section (page 25), where 'All other revenue' fell 32%, with Altera cited as a primary contributor. The strategic overview (page 15) contextualizes this drop within Intel's broader operational transformation, noting that Altera was operated as a standalone business starting in Q1 2024, which was intended to unlock future value despite the near-term revenue contraction. Together, these perspectives indicate that the Altera revenue decline was both a market-driven inventory correction and a strategic pivot point in Intel's restructuring and business model evolution.",

During Q3 2024, we concluded that our manufacturing asset portfolio, primarily for our Intel 7 process node, exceeded manufacturing capacity requirements. Upon completing an asset re-use assessment, we impaired certain construction-in-progress assets and accelerated depreciation for certain inuse manufacturing assets that resulted in $3.3 billion of charges in 2024. Our 2024 gross margin also decreased due to lower revenue, higher unit cost primarily from an increased mix of Intel 4 and Intel 7 products, higher period charges due to $922 million in Gaudi A I accelerator inventory-related charges recognized in 2024, and higher factory start-up costs. These 2024 unfavorable gross margin impacts were partially offset by certain favorable gross margin movements in 2024, including lower period charges driven by the sell-through of previously reserved inventory and lower non-accelerator reserves taken, lower period charges related to excess capacity charges, and a benefit recognized for government incentives received under the CHIPS A ct.\n\nWe are making capital investments in furtherance of our strategy. A s of December 28, 2024, our capital investments classified as construction in progress totaled $50.4 billion ($43.4 billion as of December 30, 2023). These assets have not yet been placed into service and have not yet begun depreciating. A s these construction-in-progress assets are placed into service, we expect to incur depreciation expense that impacts future production costs and, ultimately, cost of sales. To the extent we are unable to grow our revenues to offset these production costs, our gross margin and operating income will be unfavorably affected.

However, the company also acknowledges risks in Part II, Item 7, regarding its reliance on third-party manufacturers for devices, particularly for components with limited supplier options. This creates a tension: while Microsoft is investing in hardware-driven parts of the segment, it faces structural supply chain vulnerabilities that could constrain its ability to scale or respond to demand fluctuations, potentially limiting the segment's growth trajectory despite strategic focus.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach,  scale  in  resources,  the  ability  to  grow  one's  career  across  many  different  products  and  businesses,  and  competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\n\nOur  devices  are  primarily  manufactured  by  third-party  contract  manufacturers,  some  of  which  contain  certain  components  for which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited  near-term  flexibility  to  use  other manufacturers if  a  current  vendor  becomes  unavailable  or  is  unable  to  meet  our  requirements.  Extended  disruptions  at  these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain  foreign  currencies  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur  revenue  fluctuates  quarterly  and  is  generally  higher  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  our  fiscal  year.  Second  quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More  Personal  Computing.  The  segment  amounts  included  in  MD&amp;A  are  presented  on  a  basis  consistent  with  our  internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe  use  metrics  in  assessing  the  performance  of  our  business  and  to  make  informed  decisions  regarding  the  allocation  of resources.  We  disclose  metrics  to  enable  investors  to  evaluate  progress  against  our  ambitions,  provide  transparency  into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&amp;A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America  ('GAAP'),  and  growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our Office Consumer and Server products and cloud  services  metrics  and  changes  to  align  with  how  we  manage  our  Windows  OEM  and  Search  and  news  advertising businesses. None of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our MD&amp;A.",

          "chunk_text": "## PART II\n\nItem 7\n\n## Economic Conditions, Challenges, and Risks\n\nThe markets for software, devices, and cloud-based services are dynamic and highly competitive. Our competitors are developing new software and devices, while also deploying competing cloud-based services for consumers and businesses. The devices and form factors customers prefer evolve rapidly, and influence how users access services in the cloud, and in some cases, the user's choice of which suite of cloud-based services to use. We must continue to evolve and adapt over an extended time in pace with this changing environment. The investments we are making in infrastructure and devices will continue to increase our operating costs and may decrease our operating margins.\n\nOur success is highly dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees. We hire a mix of university and industry talent worldwide. We compete for talented individuals globally by offering an exceptional working environment, broad customer reach,  scale  in  resources,  the  ability  to  grow  one's  career  across  many  different  products  and  businesses,  and  competitive compensation and benefits. Aggregate demand for our software, services, and devices is correlated to global macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, which remain dynamic.\n\nOur  devices  are  primarily  manufactured  by  third-party  contract  manufacturers,  some  of  which  contain  certain  components  for which  there  are  very  few  qualified  suppliers.  For  these  components,  we  have  limited  near-term  flexibility  to  use  other manufacturers if  a  current  vendor  becomes  unavailable  or  is  unable  to  meet  our  requirements.  Extended  disruptions  at  these suppliers and/or manufacturers could lead to a similar disruption in our ability to manufacture devices on time to meet consumer demand.\n\nOur international operations provide a significant portion of our total revenue and expenses. Many of these revenue and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates may significantly affect revenue and expenses. Fluctuations in the U.S. dollar relative to certain  foreign  currencies  did  not  have  a  material  impact  on reported revenue or expenses from our international operations in fiscal year 2022.\n\nRefer to Risk Factors (Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K) for a discussion of these factors and other risks.\n\n## Seasonality\n\nOur  revenue  fluctuates  quarterly  and  is  generally  higher  in  the  second  and  fourth  quarters  of  our  fiscal  year.  Second  quarter revenue is driven by corporate year-end spending trends in our major markets and holiday season spending by consumers, and fourth quarter revenue is driven by the volume of multi-year on-premises contracts executed during the period.\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe report our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More  Personal  Computing.  The  segment  amounts  included  in  MD&amp;A  are  presented  on  a  basis  consistent  with  our  internal management reporting. Additional information on our reportable segments is contained in Note 19 - Segment Information and Geographic Data of the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K).\n\n## Metrics\n\nWe  use  metrics  in  assessing  the  performance  of  our  business  and  to  make  informed  decisions  regarding  the  allocation  of resources.  We  disclose  metrics  to  enable  investors  to  evaluate  progress  against  our  ambitions,  provide  transparency  into performance trends, and reflect the continued evolution of our products and services. Our commercial and other business metrics are fundamentally connected based on how customers use our products and services. The metrics are disclosed in the MD&amp;A or the Notes to Financial Statements (Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K). Financial metrics are calculated based on financial results prepared  in  accordance  with  accounting  principles  generally  accepted  in  the  United  States  of America  ('GAAP'),  and  growth comparisons relate to the corresponding period of last fiscal year.\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we made updates to the presentation and method of calculation for certain metrics, most notably changes to incorporate all current and anticipated revenue streams within our Office Consumer and Server products and cloud  services  metrics  and  changes  to  align  with  how  we  manage  our  Windows  OEM  and  Search  and  news  advertising businesses. None of these changes had a material impact on previously reported amounts in our MD&amp;A.",

      "answer": "Microsoft Cloud's cost of revenue increased by $10.4 billion or 20% in FY2022, driven by growth in cloud services like Azure and Office 365 Commercial. This growth contributed to a slight decrease in the Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage to 70%, although it would have increased by 3 points excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate. Despite the margin compression, Microsoft positions the Cloud as the most comprehensive and trusted platform, emphasizing hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and security\u2014factors that support long-term strategic value despite short-term margin pressures. The Commercial remaining performance obligations, which include Microsoft Cloud revenue from Azure, Office 365 Commercial, LinkedIn, and Dynamics 35, further indicate strong forward-looking demand that aligns with the company's strategic narrative.",

We also design and sell devices, including PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.\n\n## The Ambitions That Drive Us\n\nTo achieve our vision, our research and development efforts focus on three interconnected ambitions:\n\n- Reinvent productivity and business processes.\n- Build the intelligent cloud and intelligent edge platform.\n- Create more personal computing.\n\n## Reinvent Productivity and Business Processes\n\nAt Microsoft, we provide technology and resources to help our customers create a secure hybrid work environment. Our family of products plays a key role in the ways the world works, learns, and connects.\n\nOur growth depends on securely delivering continuous innovation and advancing our leading productivity and collaboration tools and  services,  including  Office  365,  Dynamics  365,  and  LinkedIn.  Microsoft  365  brings  together  Office  365,  Windows,  and Enterprise Mobility + Security to help organizations empower their employees with AI-backed tools that unlock creativity, increase collaboration,  and  fuel  innovation,  all  the  while  enabling  compliance  coverage  and  data  protection.  Microsoft  Teams  is  a comprehensive platform for work, with meetings, calls, chat, collaboration, and business process automation. Microsoft Viva is an employee experience  platform  that  brings  together  communications,  knowledge,  learning,  resources,  and  insights  powered  by Microsoft  365.  Together  with  the  Microsoft  Cloud,  Dynamics  365,  Microsoft  Teams,  and  Azure  Synapse  bring  a  new  era  of collaborative applications that transform every business function and process. Microsoft Power Platform is helping domain experts drive productivity gains with low-code/no-code tools, robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. In a dynamic labor market, LinkedIn is helping professionals use the platform to connect, learn, grow, and get hired.\n\n## Build the Intelligent Cloud and Intelligent Edge Platform\n\nAs  digital  transformation  accelerates,  organizations  in  every  sector  across  the  globe  can  address  challenges  that  will  have  a fundamental impact on their success. For enterprises, digital technology empowers employees, optimizes operations, engages customers, and in some cases, changes the very core of products and services. Microsoft has a proven track record of delivering high value to our customers across many diverse and durable growth markets.\n\nWe continue to invest in high performance and sustainable computing to meet the growing demand for fast access to Microsoft services provided by our network of cloud computing infrastructure and datacenters. Azure is a trusted cloud with comprehensive compliance coverage and AI-based security built in.\n\nOur cloud business benefits from three economies of scale: datacenters that deploy computational resources at significantly lower cost per unit than smaller ones; datacenters that coordinate and aggregate diverse customer, geographic, and application demand patterns, improving the utilization of computing, storage, and network resources; and multi-tenancy locations that lower application maintenance labor costs.\n\nThe Microsoft Cloud is the most comprehensive and trusted cloud, providing the best integration across the technology stack while offering  openness,  improving  time  to  value,  reducing  costs,  and  increasing  agility.  Being  a  global-scale  cloud, Azure  uniquely offers hybrid consistency, developer productivity, AI capabilities, and trusted security and compliance. We see more emerging use cases and needs for compute and security at the edge and are accelerating our innovation across the spectrum of intelligent edge devices,  from  Internet  of  Things  ('IoT')  sensors  to  gateway  devices  and  edge  hardware  to  build,  manage,  and  secure  edge workloads. With Azure Stack, organizations can extend Azure into their own datacenters to create a consistent stack across the public cloud and the intelligent edge.",

      "question": "How does Cisco's use of projected future revenues in valuing Splunk's customer contracts and technology assets align with the audit scrutiny of revenue recognition practices and the assumptions used in the acquisition-related fair value estimates?",
      "answer": "Cisco used projected future revenues as a key assumption in valuing Splunk's customer contracts and technology assets acquired in the $27 billion acquisition, with $6.1 billion allocated to customer-related assets and $3.9 billion to the technology asset. These valuations relied on income approach methods like the with-and-without method and the multi-period excess earnings method, which required significant judgment around projected revenues, attrition rates, and discount rates. These same projected revenues were also central to Cisco's revenue recognition practices for product and service contracts, which were flagged as a critical audit matter due to the high degree of auditor judgment required in evaluating contractual terms and variable consideration. The audit procedures included testing the reasonableness of these assumptions against external market data and consistency with Splunk\u2019s historical performance, indicating that the projected future revenues were both a material and subjective element across multiple sections of the financial reporting.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: CSCO (page_58) \u2192 Projected Future Revenues: Auditors evaluated management's assumptions related to projected future revenues, attrition rates, and discount rates in the valuation of Splunk's customer contracts and technology assets, considering consistency with external data and historical performance.",
        "Hop 2: CSCO (page_74) \u2192 Projected Future Revenues: The customer contracts and related relationships asset was valued using the with-and-without method under the income approach, which relied on projected future revenues and expenses, attrition rates, and discount rates. Similarly, the technology asset was valued using the multi-period excess earnings method, which also depended on projected future revenues and obsolescence rates.",
        "Hop 3: CSCO (page_57) \u2192 Projected Future Revenues: Revenue recognition for product and services contracts was identified as a critical audit matter, where projected revenues were used in estimating variable consideration and determining the timing and amount of revenue recognition, requiring extensive auditor judgment and testing."

      "question": "How does Cisco's increased amortization of purchased intangible assets, driven by acquisitions like Splunk and reflected in both operating expenses and cost of sales, impact the sustainability of product gross margin improvements and strategic realignment efforts?",
      "answer": "Cisco's amortization of purchased intangible assets increased significantly in fiscal 2024, primarily due to the $569 million impact from the Splunk acquisition and impairment charges of $145 million. This increase is evident in both the cost of sales ($955 million in fiscal 2024) and operating expenses ($698 million in fiscal 2024), contributing to downward pressure on product gross margin sustainability. Despite recent margin improvements, the document warns that increased amortization, among other factors, could lead to margin declines if not offset by cost reductions or increased demand. Additionally, the restructuring plans\u2014part of strategic realignment efforts\u2014aim to reinvest savings into growth areas, but the rising amortization costs may constrain the financial flexibility needed to support these initiatives over time.",

        "Hop 1: CSCO (page_17) \u2192 Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets: The document notes that increased amortization, especially from acquisitions, is a factor that could lead to a decline in product gross margin, which is critical to Cisco's financial performance.",
        "Hop 2: CSCO (page_45) \u2192 Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets: The increase in amortization is directly tied to recent acquisitions like Splunk ($569 million) and impairment charges ($145 million), which have added significant expense pressure in fiscal 2024.",
        "Hop 3: CSCO (page_77) \u2192 Amortization of Purchased Intangible Assets: Financial data shows a total amortization expense of $1,653 million in fiscal 2024, with $955 million impacting cost of sales and $698 million impacting operating expenses, illustrating the broad financial impact across the income statement."

This divestiture proceeds partially offset the $25,925 million increase in cash used for acquisitions, primarily driven by the $53.4 billion VMware acquisition. The proceeds from the EUC sale were part of a broader capital allocation strategy that also included issuing $39,954 million in new debt, paying $9,814 million in dividends, and repurchasing $7,176 million of common stock.

The $8,187 million decrease in net income was largely driven by $13,058 million higher non-cash adjustments including amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and deferred taxes and other non-cash taxes related to the VMware Merger.\n\n## Investing Activities\n\nCash flows from investing activities primarily consisted of cash used for acquisitions, proceeds from the sale of a business, capital expenditures, and proceeds and payments related to investments. The $22,381 million increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to a $25,925 million increase in cash used for acquisitions due to the VMware Merger and the acquisition of Seagate's SoC operations, net of cash acquired, offset in part by $3,485 million proceeds from the sale of the EUC business.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nCash flows from financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds and payments related to our long-term borrowings, dividend payments, stock repurchases, and employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards. The $13,890 million increase in cash flows from financing activities for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to $39,954 million of net proceeds from the 2023 Term Loans and the issuance of senior notes, offset in part by a $19,205 million increase in payments on debt obligations, a $3,355 million increase in employee withholding tax payments related to net settled equity awards, a $2,169 million increase in dividend payments, and a $1,352 million increase in stock repurchases.\n\n## ITEM 7A.

('VMware'), for approximately $30.8 billion in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis) with a fair value of $53.4 billion.\n- We generated $19,962 million of cash from operations.\n- We paid $9,814 million in cash dividends.\n- We repurchased $7,176 million of common stock.\n- We completed a ten-for-one forward stock split of our common stock. All share, equity award and per share amounts have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\n\n## Acquisitions and Divestitures\n\n## Acquisition of VMware and Divestiture of EUC\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we acquired VMware in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger'). The VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock with a fair value of $53,398 million. In addition, we assumed all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit ('RSU') awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards were converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding RSU awards held by non-employee directors and in-the-money VMware stock options were accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nWe funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Term Loans, as defined and discussed in Note 10. 'Borrowings' included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as cash on hand. We assumed $8,250 million of VMware's outstanding senior unsecured notes.\n\nOn July 1, 2024, we sold VMware's end-user computing ('EUC') business to KKR &amp; Co. Inc. for cash consideration of $3.5 billion, after working capital adjustments.\n\n## Acquisition of Seagate's SoC Operations\n\nOn April 23, 2024, we acquired certain assets related to the design, development, and manufacture of System-on-Chip ('SoC') operations of Seagate Technology Holdings plc for $600 million.\n\n## Net Revenue\n\nA majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products, as well as from modules, switches and subsystems. Net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms.\n\nOur overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments, have varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-market demand, including the effects of seasonality, which are discussed in detail in Part I, Item 1. Business under 'Seasonality' of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\nDistributors and original equipment manufacturers ('OEMs'), or their contract manufacturers, typically account for the substantial majority of our semiconductor sales. To serve customers around the world, we have strategically developed relationships with large global electronic component distributors, complemented by a number of regional distributors with customer relationships based on their respective product ranges. We have established strong relationships with leading OEM customers across multiple target markets. Our direct sales force focuses on supporting our large OEM customers and has specialized product and service knowledge that enables us to sell specific offerings at key levels throughout a customer's organization. Certain customers require us to contract with them directly and with specified intermediaries, such as contract manufacturers. Many of our major customer relationships have been in place for many years and are often the result of years of collaborative product development. This has enabled us to build our extensive IP portfolio and develop critical expertise regarding our customers' requirements, including substantial system-level knowledge. This collaboration has provided us with key i nsights into our customers' businesses and has enabled us to be more efficient and productive and to better serve our target markets and customers. We recognize revenue upon the delivery of our products to the distributors, which can cause our quarterly net revenue to fluctuate significantly.

However, the subsequent divestiture of VMware's EUC business to KKR for $3.5 billion indicates a strategic refocusing of the segment toward core infrastructure capabilities. This is further reinforced by the fact that as of November 3, 2024, the Infrastructure Software segment had approximately $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations, with 43% expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, signaling strong forward-looking revenue commitments.

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usage-based royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of November 3, 2024 were approximately $20.5 billion. We expect approximately 43% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. For contracts with termination for convenience rights, our customers generally do not exercise those rights. In addition, the majority of our revenue is from contracts with a duration of one year or less. Accordingly, our remaining performance obligations disclosed above are not indicative of revenue for future periods.\n\n## 4. Acquisitions\n\n## Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn November 22, 2023, we completed the VMware Merger. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger was indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash or 2.52 shares of Broadcom common stock (on a split adjusted basis). The stockholder election was prorated, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, in each case, was equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the VMware Merger. Based on the VMware stockholders' elections, the VMware stockholders received approximately $30,788 million in cash and 544 million shares of Broadcom common stock with a fair value of $53,398 million.\n\nWe funded the cash portion of the VMware Merger with the net proceeds from the issuance of the 2023 Term Loans, as defined and discussed in Note 10. 'Borrowings', as well as cash on hand. We assumed $8,250 million of VMware's outstanding senior unsecured notes.\n\n## Purchase Consideration\n\n",

      "question": "How does Broadcom's infrastructure software segment demonstrate both strategic growth and financial complexity when considering its post-acquisition asset valuation, operating income growth, and tax-related liabilities?",
      "answer": "Broadcom's infrastructure software segment shows significant strategic growth, particularly through the VMware acquisition, which added $54,206 million in assets as of November 3, 2024, increasing the segment's total assets from $17,652 million in fiscal 2023 to $71,858 million in fiscal 2024. Operationally, the segment delivered a 148% year-over-year increase in operating income, rising from $5,639 million to $13,977 million. However, this growth is accompanied by financial complexity, as evidenced by the company's $6,544 million in unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties as of November 3, 2024, a portion of which stems from the VMware acquisition. This combination of aggressive expansion and tax exposure highlights the dual nature of the segment\u2019s development trajectory.",

During fiscal years 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recognized interest and penalties of $144 million, $22 million and $25 million respectively, within the provision for income taxes. As of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, the total accrued interest and penalties was approximately $701 million and $389 million, respectively. The increase in total accrued interest and penalties was primarily the result of the VMware acquisition in addition to the current year accrual.\n\nAs of November 3, 2024 and October 29, 2023, approximately $6,544 million and $5,044 million, respectively, of the unrecognized tax benefits and accrued interest and penalties would, if recognized, benefit our effective income tax rate. We are subject to U.S. income tax examination for fiscal years 2018 and later. Certain of our acquired companies are subject to tax examinations in major jurisdictions outside of the U.S. for fiscal years 2005 and later.

Segment Information\n\n## Reportable Segments\n\nWe have two reportable segments: semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software. Each segment has separate financial information that is utilized on a regular basis by the CODM in determining how to allocate resources and evaluate performance. The reportable segments are determined based on several factors including, but not limited to, customer base, homogeneity of products, technology, delivery channels and similar economic characteristics.\n\nSemiconductor solutions . We provide semiconductor solutions for managing the movement of data in data center, service provider, and enterprise networking applications, including AI networking and connectivity. We provide a broad variety of radio frequency semiconductor devices, wireless connectivity solutions, custom touch controllers, and inductive charging solutions for mobile applications. We also provide semiconductor solutions for enabling the settop box and broadband access markets and for enabling secure movement of digital data to and from host machines, such as servers, personal computers and storage systems, to the underlying storage devices, such as hard disk drives and solid state drives. We also provide a broad variety of products for the general i ndustrial and automotive markets. Our semiconductor solutions segment also includes our IP licensing.\n\nInfrastructure software. We provide a portfolio of software solutions that help enterprises simplify their IT environments so they can increase business velocity and flexibility, and enable customers to plan, develop, deliver, automate, manage and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, edge, mobile, and private and hybrid cloud platforms. Our portfolio of infrastructure and security software is designed to modernize, optimize, and secure the most complex private and hybrid cloud environments, enabling scalability, agility, automation, insights, resiliency and security making it easy for customers to run their mission-critical workloads. We also offer mission-critical FC SAN products and related software.\n\nOur CODM assesses the performance of each segment and allocates resources to each segment based on net revenue and operating results and does not evaluate each segment using discrete asset information. Operating results by segment include items that are directly attributable to each segment and also i nclude shared expenses such as marketing, general and administrative activities, facilities and IT expenses. Shared expenses are primarily allocated based on revenue and headcount.",

      "answer": "Accenture faces a complex interplay of risks that could affect its profitability and ability to sustain AI investments. First, the company notes that client spending, particularly for smaller, short-duration consulting contracts, has slowed due to economic and geopolitical volatility (page_21). This spending pattern directly affects revenue predictability and resource planning, especially in consulting. Second, Accenture's global delivery model is heavily concentrated in India and the Philippines, which exposes the firm to operational risks such as geopolitical tensions, natural disasters, and infrastructure disruptions (page_29). These risks could impair the delivery of services, including AI-based offerings, which are increasingly central to Accenture's strategy. Finally, the company highlights that as AI and automation evolve, demand for traditional services may decline, and Accenture must continuously innovate and invest to maintain its competitive edge (page_22). If client spending remains volatile and delivery center risks materialize, Accenture may struggle to fund the necessary R&D and strategic investments in AI, threatening its leadership position and long-term profitability.",

          "chunk_text": "## Item 1A. Risk Factors\n\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and/or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies, including us. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price. Risks in this section are grouped in the following categories: (1) Business Risks; (2) Financial Risks; (3) Operational Risks; and (4) Legal and Regulatory Risks. Many risks affect more than one category, and the risks are not in order of significance or probability of occurrence because they have been grouped by categories.\n\n## Business Risks\n\nOur results of operations have been, and may in the future be, adversely affected by volatile, negative or uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions and the effects of these conditions on our clients' businesses and levels of business activity.\n\nGlobal macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions affect us, our clients' businesses and the markets they serve. V olatile, negative and uncertain economic and geopolitical conditions have in the past undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets and other markets, which are increasingly interdependent, causing our clients to reduce or defer their spending on new initiatives and technologies, and resulting in clients reducing, delaying or eliminating spending under existing contracts with us, which negatively affects our business. Growth in some of the markets we serve has slowed and could continue to slow, or could slow in other markets or stagnate or contract, in each case, for an extended period of time. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\nOngoing economic and geopolitical volatility and uncertainty and changing demand patterns affect our business in a number of other ways, including making it more difficult to accurately  forecast client demand and effectively build our revenue and resource plans, particularly in consulting. Economic and geopolitical volatility and uncertainty is particularly  challenging because it may take some time for the effects and changes in demand patterns resulting from these and other factors to manifest themselves in our business and results of operations. Changing demand patterns from economic and political volatility and uncertainty, including as a result of increasing geopolitical tensions, inflation, economic downturns, changes in global trade policies, global health emergencies and their impact on us, our clients and the industries we serve, have in the past had a negative impact and could in the future have a significant negative impact on our results of operations. For example, some of these conditions slowed the pace and level of client spending, particularly for smaller contracts with a shorter duration and for our consulting services during fiscal 2024. Clients continue to prioritize large-scale transformations, which convert to revenue over a longer period.\n\nOur business depends on generating and maintaining client demand for our services and solutions, including through the adaptation and expansion of our services and solutions in response to ongoing changes in technology and offerings, and a significant reduction in such demand or an inability to respond to the evolving technological environment could materially affect our results of operations.\n\nOur financial results depend in part on the demand for our services and solutions, which could be negatively affected by numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control and unrelated to our work product. A s described above, volatile, negative or uncertain global economic and political conditions and lower growth or contraction in the markets we serve have adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect client demand for our services and solutions. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop and implement services and solutions that anticipate and respond to rapid and continuing changes in technology and offerings to serve the evolving needs of our clients. Examples of areas of significant change include digital-, cloud- and security-related offerings, which are continually evolving, as well as developments in areas such as A I, including generative A I, augmented and virtual reality, automation, blockchain, Internet of Things, quantum and edge computing, infrastructure and network engineering, intelligent connected products, digital",

A s we expand our services and solutions into these new areas, we may be exposed to operational, legal, regulatory, ethical, technological and other risks specific to such new areas, which may negatively affect our reputation and demand for our services and solutions.\n\nTechnological developments may materially affect the cost and use of technology by our clients and, in the case of cloud, data and A I solutions, could affect the nature of how we generate revenue. Some of these technological developments have reduced and replaced, in whole or in part, some of our historical services and solutions and will continue to do so in the future. This has caused, and may in the future cause, clients to delay spending under existing contracts and engagements and to delay entering into new contracts while they evaluate new technologies. Such technological developments and spending delays can negatively impact our results of operations if we are unable to introduce new pricing or commercial models that reflect the value of these technological developments or if the pace and level of spending on new technologies are not sufficient to make up any shortfall.\n\nDevelopments in the industries we serve, which may be rapid, also could shift demand to new services and solutions. If, as a result of new technologies or changes in the industries we serve, our clients demand new services and solutions, we may be less competitive in these new areas or need to make significant investment to meet that demand. Our growth strategy focuses on responding to these types of developments by driving innovation and making strategic investments in acquisitions, joint ventures and adjacencies to our current offerings that will enable us to expand our business into new growth areas. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and adapt to industry developments, or evolve and expand our business at sufficient speed and scale, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments and successfully drive innovation, our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage and to execute on our growth strategy could be adversely affected.\n\nIn a particular geographic market, service or industry group, a small number of clients have contributed, or may, in the future contribute, a significant portion of the revenues of such geographic market, service or industry group, and any decision by such a client to delay, reduce, or eliminate spending on our services and solutions have had and could in the future have a disproportionate impact on the results of operations in the relevant geographic market, service or industry group.\n\nMany of our consulting contracts are less than 12 months in duration, and these contracts typically permit a client to terminate the agreement with as little as 30 days' notice. Longer-term, larger and more complex contracts, such as the majority of our managed services contracts, generally require a longer notice period for termination and often include an early termination charge to be paid to us, but this charge might not be sufficient to cover our costs or make up for anticipated ongoing revenues and profits lost upon termination of the contract. M any of our contracts allow clients to terminate, delay, reduce or eliminate spending on the services and solutions we provide. A dditionally, a client could choose not to retain us for additional stages of a project, try to renegotiate the terms of its contract or cancel or delay additional planned work. When contracts are terminated or not renewed, we lose the anticipated revenues, and it may take significant time to replace the level of rev enues lost. Consequently, our results of operations in subsequent periods could be materially lower than expected. The specific business or financial condition of a client, changes in management and changes in a client's strategy are also all factors that can result in terminations, cancellations or delays.\n\n## Risks and uncertainties related to the development and use of A I could harm our business, damage our reputation or give rise to legal or regulatory action.\n\nWe are increasingly applying A I-based technologies, including generative A I, to our services and solutions, to how we deliver work to our clients, and to our own internal operations. In addition, we are creating new offerings to implement A I solutions for clients. We have made significant investments in A I and are continuing to incur significant development and operational costs to develop and deploy our A I services and solutions for ourselves and for our clients. If we fail to continue to develop leading AI services and solutions, including generative A I, we may lose our leadership position in this area and fail to realize the anticipated benefits of our investments in AI.\n\nAI technologies are complex and rapidly evolving, and we face significant competition, including from our own clients, who may develop their own internal A I-related capabilities, which can lead to reduced demand for our services or solutions. A s these technologies evolve, some services and tasks currently performed by our people will be replaced by automation, including A I-enabled solutions, which will lead to reduced demand for our services and/or adversely affect the utilization rate of our professionals, if demand for those services is not replaced by demand for new services. Leveraging A I capabilities for our internal functions and operations presents additional risks, costs, and challenges, including those discussed in these risk factors.\n\nThe development, adoption, and use of AI technologies is still in the early stages and involve significant risks and uncertainties, which may expose us to legal, reputational and financial harm. A I algorithms and training methodologies may be flawed and datasets may be overbroad, insufficient, or contain biased information. M oreover, the use of A I may give rise to risks related to harmful content, accuracy, bias, intellectual property infringement or misappropriation, defamation, data privacy, cybersecurity and health and safety, among others, and also bring the possibility of new or enhanced governmental",

We may also be required to raise additional financing, which will depend on, among other factors, our financial position and performance, as well as prevailing market conditions and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to obtain additional financing or refinancing on terms acceptable to us, or at all, which could adversely impact our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness or to repay our outstanding indebtedness as it becomes due and could adversely impact our business and financial condition. A dditionally, further indebtedness may increase the risk of a future downgrade in our credit ratings, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing.\n\n## Changes to accounting standards or in the estimates and assumptions we make in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements could adversely affect our financial results.\n\nOur financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. It is possible that changes in accounting standards could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. The application of generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions about certain items and future events that affect our reported financial condition and results of operations, and our accompanying disclosure with respect to, among other things, revenue recognition and income taxes. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in M anagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations under 'Critical A ccounting Policies and Estimates.' We base our estimates on historical experience, contractual commitments and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and at the time they are made. These estimates and assumptions involve the use of judgment and are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If our estimates, or the assumptions underlying such estimates, are not correct, actual results may differ materially from our estimates, and we may need to, among other things, adjust revenues or accrue additional costs that could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\n## Operational Risks\n\n## As a result of our geographically diverse operations and our strategy to continue to grow in our key markets around the world, we are more susceptible to certain risks.\n\nWe have offices and operations in more than 200 cities in 52 countries around the world. One aspect of our strategy is to continue to grow in our key markets around the world. Our strategy might not be successful. If we are unable to manage the risks of our global operations and strategy, our results of operations and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected.\n\nHealth emergencies or pandemics; acts of terrorist violence; political, social and civil unrest; regional and international war and other hostilities and international responses to these wars and hostilities; natural disasters, sea level rise, floods, droughts and water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires and storms, occurrences of which may increase in frequency and severity as a result of climate change; or the threat of or perceived potential for these events; and other acts of god have had and could in the future have significantly negative impacts on us. These events could adversely affect our clients' levels of business activity and precipitate sudden and significant changes in regional and global economic conditions and cycles. These events also pose significant risks to our people and to physical facilities and operations around the world, whether the facilities are ours or those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers or clients. By disrupting communications and travel and increasing the difficulty  of obtaining and retaining highly skilled and qualified people, these types of events impact our ability to deliver our services and solutions to our clients. Extended disruptions of electricity, other public utilities or network or cloud services at our facilities or in the areas where our people are working remotely, as well as physical infrastructure damage to, system failures at, cyberattacks on, or security incidents involving, our facilities or systems, or those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers or clients, could also adversely affect our ability to conduct our business and serve our clients. If any of these circumstances occurs, we have a greater risk that interruptions in communications with our clients and other A ccenture locations and people, and any down-time in important processes we operate for clients, could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our reputation in the marketplace.\n\nOur business model is dependent on our global delivery capability. While our delivery centers are located throughout the world, we have based large portions of our delivery capability in India and the Philippines, where we have the largest and second largest number of our people located, respectively. In addition, certain of our clients and markets are primarily supported by individual delivery centers. Concentrating our delivery capability in these locations presents a number of operational risks, including those discussed in this risk factor, many of which are beyond our control and which have been and may in the future be exacerbated by increasing geopolitical tensions. While these events have not materially impacted our ability to deliver services to our clients, international conflicts are unpredictable and we might not be as successful in mitigating these operational risks in the future.\n\nWe are unable to protect our people, facilities and systems, and those of our ecosystem partners, suppliers and clients, against all such events. Our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not be effective, particularly if catastrophic",

      "answer": "The Communications, Media & Technology segment reported a revenue decline of 5% year-over-year to $10.8B in FY24. This segment is composed of two subsegments: Communications & Media (40% of segment revenue) and Software & Platforms (60% of segment revenue). Regionally, North America revenues declined by 1%, while Growth Markets experienced a 7% local currency growth. Given that Communications & Media includes clients in communications service providers, broadcasters, and media infrastructure\u2014many of which are concentrated in North America\u2014it is likely that weakness in North America disproportionately impacted this subsegment. Meanwhile, the Software & Platforms subsegment, which includes cloud-based software and consumer platforms, may have benefited from growth in emerging markets.

This change impacts the comparability of financial data across periods, particularly in the context of business optimization initiatives and severance costs tied to geographic realignment. Additionally, the Europe market\u2019s expanded scope intersects with a $206 million decrease in Other Income (Expense), net, which includes gains and losses from investments\u2014suggesting that investment performance could now be assessed within a broader EMEA context. Finally, the introduction of ASU No. 2023-07, effective in fiscal 2025, will require enhanced segment disclosures, which will likely further shape how the newly structured EMEA segment is analyzed and reported going forward.",

The A SU will be effective beginning with our annual fiscal 2025 financial statements and requires a retrospective method upon adoption. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our segment disclosures.\n\nOn December 14, 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes paid, prescribes standard categories for the components of the effective tax rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The A SU will be effectiv e beginning with our annual fiscal 2026 financial statements and allows for adoption on a prospective basis, with a retrospective option. We are in the process of assessing the impacts and method of adoption. This ASU will impact our income tax disclosures, but not our financial position or results of operations.",

      "answer": "AMD's $48 million licensing gain from the THATIC JV in 2024 represents a small but consistent contribution to its $1.9 billion operating income, showing continued monetization of licensed IP despite the U.S. Entity List designation that restricts further collaboration. This licensing gain aligns with AMD's broader IP strategy, as the company also spent $6.5 billion on R&D in 2024 to support its AI strategy, while recognizing $186 million in restructuring charges specifically to reallocate resources toward AI and enterprise markets. Notably, although AMD maintains a zero carrying value investment in the THATIC JV, the licensing revenue continues to flow, suggesting a passive but stable income stream that complements its aggressive AI investment strategy.",

T he decrease was primarily due to certain acquisition-related intangibles being fully amortized in the prior fiscal year.\n\n## Restructuring Charges\n\nWe recognized $186 million of restructuring charges in 2024 due to the implementation of a restructuring plan (the 2024 Restructuring Plan). The 2024 Restructuring Plan was focused on driv ing efficiencies across the business and aligning resources with our largest growth opportunities in the AI and enterprise markets.\n\n## Licensing Gain\n\nWe hold equity interests in two joint v entures (collectiv ely, the THATIC JV) with Higon Information T echnology Co., Ltd.

      "answer": "AMD positions the Embedded segment as a highly diversified business serving aerospace, automotive, industrial, and communications markets, with a focus on customer collaboration and design support (page_10). The segment is formally defined to include products like embedded CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, and SOMs, distinguishing it as a core reportable segment alongside Data Center, Client, and Gaming (page_69). Financially, the segment's operating income from the Xilinx acquisition excludes $4.2 billion in amortization, stock-based compensation, and acquisition costs, which are instead reported under 'All Other,' indicating a strategic separation of acquisition-related expenses from segment-level performance (page_72). Together, these perspectives show AMD is emphasizing embedded technologies as a distinct, customer-centric growth vector while managing its financial integration selectively.",

      "answer": "AMD defines its Client Segment (page_69) as a key business unit focused on CPUs, APUs, and chipsets for desktops and notebooks, serving PC OEMs, distributors, and ODMs (page_10). This segment is also one of the four reporting units for goodwill impairment testing (page_48), indicating its strategic and financial importance. The Client Segment's revenue is subject to variable considerations such as OEM price incentives and product return rights, which AMD accounts for through revenue adjustments based on historical data and market analysis (page_48). This implies that the financial health and performance of the Client Segment, as a goodwill-bearing unit, is directly influenced by the accuracy of these revenue adjustments and the stability of its OEM and distributor relationships. Therefore, any misestimation in OEM rebates or return rates could impact both the segment's reported performance and its goodwill valuation, highlighting a critical interplay between operational execution, financial reporting, and strategic asset valuation.",

Where funds prov ided for such programs can be estimated, we recognize a reduction to rev enue at the time the related rev enue is recognized; otherwise, we recognize such reduction to rev enue at the later of when: i) the related rev enue transaction occurs; or ii) the program is offered. For transactions where we reimburse a customer for a portion of the customer's cost to  perform  specific  product  adv ertising  or  marketing  and  promotional  activ ities,  such  amounts  are  recognized  as  a  reduction  to  rev enue  unless  they qualify for expense recognition.\n\nWe  also  prov ide  limited  product  return  rights  to  certain  OEMs  and  to  most  distribution  customers.  T hese  return  rights  are  generally  limited  to  a contractual percentage of the customer's prior quarter shipments, although, from time to time we may approv e additional product returns beyond the contractual arrangements based on the applicable facts and circumstances. In order to estimate adjustments to rev enue to account for these returns, including  product  restocking  rights  prov ided  to  distributor  and  OEM  customers,  we  utilize  relev ant,  trended  actual  historical  product  return  rate information gathered, adjusted for actual known information or ev ents, as applicable.\n\nOverall, our estimates of adjustments to contract price due to v ariable consideration under our contracts with OEM and distributor customers, based on our assumptions and include adjustments, if any, for known ev ents, hav e been materially consistent with actual results; howev er, these estimates are subject to management's judgment and actual prov isions could be different from our estimates and current prov isions, resulting in future adjustments to our rev enue and operating results.\n\nInventory  Valuation. We  v alue  inv entory  at  standard  cost,  adjusted  to  approximate  the  lower  of  actual  cost  or  estimated  net  realizable  v alue  using assumptions about future demand and market conditions. Material assumptions we use to estimate necessary inv entory carrying v alue adjustments can be  unique  to  each  product  and  are  based  on  specific  facts  and  circumstances.  In  determining  excess  or  obsolescence  reserv es  for  products,  we consider assumptions such as changes in business and economic conditions, other-than-temporary decreases in demand for our products, and changes in  technology or customer requirements.  In determining the lower of cost or net realizable v alue reserv es, we consider assumptions such as recent historical sales activ ity and selling prices, as well as estimates of future selling prices. If in any period we anticipate a change in assumptions such as future demand or market conditions to be less fav orable than our prev ious estimates, additional inv entory write-downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales, resulting in a negativ e impact to our gross margin in that period. If in any period we are able to sell inv entories that had been written down to a lev el below the ultimate realized selling price in a prev ious period, related rev enue would be recorded with a lower or no offsetting charge to cost of sales resulting in a net benefit to our gross margin in that period. Ov erall, our estimates of inv entory carrying v alue adjustments hav e been materially consistent with actual results.\n\nGoodwill. Goodwill  is  the  excess  of  the  aggregate  of  the  consideration  transferred  ov er  the  identifiable  assets  acquired  and  liabilities  assumed  in connection with business combinations. Our reporting units are at the operating segment lev el. Our goodwill is contained within four reporting units: Data Center, Client, Gaming and Embedded.\n\nWe perform our goodwill impairment analysis as of the first day of the fourth quarter of each year and, if certain ev ents or circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have been incurred, on a more frequent basis. The analysis may include both qualitativ e and quantitativ e factors to assess the likelihood of an impairment, which occurs when the carrying v alue of a reporting unit exceeds its fair v alue. Significant judgment is required in estimating the fair v alue of our reporting units to determine if the fair v alues of those units exceed their carrying v alues and an impairment to goodwill is required when a quantitativ e goodwill impairment test is performed. We typically obtain the assistance of third-party v aluation specialists to help in determining the fair v alue of our reporting units. Changes in operating plans or adv erse changes in the business or in the macroeconomic env ironment in the future could reduce the underlying cash flows used to estimate fair v alues and could result in a decline in fair v alue that would trigger future impairment charges of our reporting units' goodwill. Based on our annual qualitativ e impairment test, we concluded it is not more likely than not that the carrying v alue of each reporting unit exceeded its fair v alue.",

Despite this significant operational footprint and revenue contribution, the segment was allocated only $172 million in goodwill, which is much lower compared to the $4,158 million allocated to Analog.

      "question": "How does Texas Instruments' discussion of its 14% annual operating tax rate in 2021 reconcile with its GAAP effective tax rate differences, strategic business model emphasis, and the treatment of discrete tax items?",
      "answer": "Texas Instruments reported a 14% annual operating tax rate for both 2021 and 2020, which excludes discrete tax items and is used to reflect the ongoing operational tax burden. However, the GAAP effective tax rate was 13% in 2021 and 7% in 2020, with the 2020 rate significantly impacted by a $249 million discrete tax benefit from a depreciation-related uncertain tax position settlement. This distinction aligns with TI's strategic focus on analog and embedded processing products, which generate strong cash flow and support a consistent tax planning environment. The separation between the non-GAAP annual operating tax rate and GAAP effective tax rate highlights how discrete items can materially affect reported tax rates, while the consistent 14% operating rate reflects the company's stable underlying tax position despite fluctuating GAAP rates.",

          "chunk_text": "- Because we own much of our manufacturing capacity, a significant portion of our operating cost is fixed. When factory loadings decrease, our fixed costs are spread over reduced output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins decrease. Conversely, as factory loadings increase, our fixed costs are spread over increased output and, absent other circumstances, our profit margins increase.\n- For an explanation of free cash flow and the term 'annual operating tax rate,' see the Non-GAAP financial information section.\n- All dollar amounts in the tables are stated in millions of U.S. dollars.\n\nOur results of operations provides details of our financial results for 2021 and 2020 and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussion of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in 'Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations' in Part II, Item 7 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n\nThe coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic and its effects are impacting and will likely continue to impact market conditions and business operations across industries worldwide, including at TI. Therefore, we remain cautious about how the economy might behave for the next few years and continue to monitor potential impact on our operations.\n\n## Results of operations\n\nOur strategic focus is on analog and embedded processing products sold into six end markets: industrial, automotive, personal electronics, communications equipment, enterprise systems and other. While all end markets represent good opportunities, we place additional strategic emphasis on designing and selling those products into the industrial and automotive markets, which we believe represent the best growth opportunities. Gross margin of 67.5% reflected the quality of our product portfolio, as well as the efficiency of our manufacturing strategy, including the benefit of 300millimeter production.\n\nOur focus on analog and embedded processing allows us to generate strong cash flow from operations. Our cash flow from operations of $8.76 billion underscored the strength of our business model. Free cash flow was $6.29 billion and represented 34.3% of revenue. During 2021, we returned $4.41 billion to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases. Over the same period, our dividend represented 62% of free cash flow, underscoring its sustainability.\n\n## Details of financial results - 2021 compared with 2020\n\nRevenue of $18.34 billion increased $3.88 billion, or 27%, due to higher revenue from Analog and, to a lesser extent, Embedded Processing.\n\nGross profit of $12.38 billion was up $3.11 billion, or 34%, primarily due to higher revenue. As a percentage of revenue, gross profit increased to 67.5% from 64.1%.\n\nOperating expenses (R&amp;D and SG&amp;A) were $3.22 billion compared with $3.15 billion.\n\nAcquisition charges were $142 million compared with $198 million and were non-cash.\n\nRestructuring charges/other was $54 million due to integration charges at our Lehi, Utah, manufacturing facility partially offset by gains on sales of assets, compared with $24 million due to an Embedded Processing action in 2020.\n\nOperating profit was $8.96 billion, or 48.8% of revenue, compared with $5.89 billion, or 40.8% of revenue.\n\nOther income and expense (OI&amp;E) was $143 million of income compared with $313 million of income, which decreased primarily due to lower royalty income. See Note 11 to the financial statements.\n\nOur provision for income taxes was $1.15 billion compared with $422 million. This increase was due to higher income before income taxes and lower discrete tax benefits compared to 2020, which included a $249 million benefit from the settlement of a depreciation-related uncertain tax position.",

      "answer": "The concentration of a major customer contributing 9-10% of revenue (primarily in the Analog segment) aligns with TI's strategic focus on free cash flow growth and its competitive positioning because the Analog segment is not only the largest revenue contributor (77% of total revenue in 2021), but also central to the company\u2019s long-term value creation model. Given that the Analog segment includes both Power and Signal Chain product lines and is positioned as a key enabler of digitization across industrial, automotive, and personal electronics markets, maintaining strong relationships with major customers is essential to sustaining this growth. Furthermore, since the company evaluates and allocates resources to segments based on operating metrics and centralized costs are charged to segments on a per-unit basis, the financial health and scale of the Analog segment directly influence TI\u2019s ability to generate and grow free cash flow per share.

No end customer accounted for 10% or more of revenue in 2021 or 2019.\n\n## 2. Basis of presentation and significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Basis of presentation\n\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The basis of these financial statements is comparable for all periods presented herein.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. All dollar and share amounts in the financial statements and tables in these notes, except per-share amounts, are presented in millions unless otherwise indicated. We have reclassified certain amounts in the prior periods' financial statements to conform to the 2021 presentation.\n\nThe preparation of financial statements requires the use of estimates from which final results may vary.\n\n## Significant accounting policies and practices\n\n## Revenue recognition\n\nWe generate revenue primarily from the sale of semiconductor products, either directly to a customer or to a distributor, and recognize revenue when control is transferred. Control is considered transferred when title and risk of loss pass, when the customer becomes obligated to pay and, where required, when the customer has accepted the products. This transfer generally occurs at a point in time upon shipment or delivery to the customer or distributor, depending upon the terms of the sales order. Payment for sales to customers and distributors is generally due on our standard commercial terms. For sales to distributors, payment is not contingent upon resale of the products.\n\nRevenue from sales of our products that are subject to inventory consignment agreements is recognized at a point in time, when the customer or distributor pulls product from consignment inventory that we store at designated locations. Delivery and transfer of control occur at that point, when title and risk of loss transfers and the customer or distributor becomes obligated to pay for the products pulled from inventory. Until the products are pulled for use or sale by the customer or distributor, we retain control over the products' disposition, including the right to pull back or relocate the products.\n\nThe revenue recognized is adjusted based on allowances, which are prepared on a portfolio basis using a most likely amount methodology based on analysis of historical data and contractual terms. These allowances, which are not material, generally include adjustments for pricing arrangements, product returns , incentives and credit losses. We recognize shipping fees, if any, received from customers in revenue. We include the related shipping and handling costs in cost of revenue. The majority of our customers pay these fees directly to third parties.\n\n## Advertising costs\n\nWe expense advertising and other promotional costs as incurred. This expense was $27 million, $28 million and $30 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n\n## Income taxes\n\nWe account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach. We record the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for future tax consequences related to events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns. We record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\n\n## Other assessed taxes\n\nSome transactions require us to collect taxes such as sales, value-added and excise taxes from our customers. These transactions are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Income on a net (excluded from revenue) basis.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design, make and sell semiconductors to electronics designers and manufacturers all over the world. We have two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitative thresholds for individually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in evaluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-level items, such as litigation expenses, environmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, provide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not provided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the chief operating decision maker evaluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We have no material intersegment revenue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies and practices.",

We will invest to strengthen our competitive advantages, be disciplined in capital allocation and stay diligent in our pursuit of efficiencies. Finally, we will remain focused on the belief that long-term growth of free cash flow per share is the ultimate measure to generate value.\n\n## Product information\n\nSemiconductors are electronic components that serve as the building blocks inside modern electronic systems and equipment. Semiconductors, generally known as 'chips,' combine multiple transistors to form a complete electronic circuit. We have a diverse product portfolio that is used to accomplish many different things, such as converting and amplifying signals, interfacing with other devices, managing and distributing power, processing data, canceling noise and improving signal resolution. This broad portfolio includes approximately 80,000 products that are integral to almost every type of electronic equipment.\n\nOur segments represent groups of similar products that are combined on the basis of similar design and development requirements, product characteristics, manufacturing processes and distribution channels. Our segments also reflect how management allocates resources and measures results.\n\n## Analog\n\nOur Analog segment generated $14.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often converting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by converting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. As the digitization of electronics continues, there is a growing need and opportunity for analog chips to provide the power to run devices and the critical interfaces with human beings, the real world and other electronic devices. Our Analog products are used in many markets, particularly industrial, automotive and personal electronics.\n\nSales of our Analog products generated about 77% of our revenue in 2021.\n\nOur Analog segment includes the following major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n\n## Power\n\nPower includes products that help customers manage power in electronic systems. Our broad portfolio is designed to manage power requirements across different voltage levels, including battery-management solutions, DC/DC switching regulators, AC/DC and isolated controllers and converters, power switches, linear regulators, voltage references and lighting products.\n\n## Signal Chain\n\nSignal Chain includes products that sense, condition and measure real-world signals to allow information to be transferred or converted for further processing and control. Our Signal Chain products include amplifiers, data converters, interface products, motor drives, clocks, logic and sensing products.\n\n## Embedded Processing\n\nOur Embedded Processing segment generated $3.05 billion of revenue in 2021. Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for various combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application. Our devices vary from simple, low-cost microcontrollers used in applications such as electric toothbrushes to highly specialized, complex devices such as motor control. Our Embedded Processing products are used in many markets, particularly industrial and automotive.\n\nAn important characteristic of our Embedded Processing products is that our customers often invest their own research and development (R&amp;D) to write software that operates on our products. This investment tends to increase the length of our customer relationships because many customers prefer to reuse software from one product generation to the next.",

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's customer concentration risk in its Compute & Networking segment interact with its acquisition-related integration challenges, particularly considering the strategic importance of maintaining relationships with key customers like A, B, and C?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment is strategically central to its business, powering over 75% of the global TOP500 supercomputers and serving key industries like AI, automotive, and data centers (page 5). However, this segment is heavily reliant on a small number of customers\u2014Direct Customers A, B, and C accounted for 12%, 11%, and 11% of total revenue in fiscal year 2025, respectively (page 23). At the same time, the company faces significant risks related to acquisitions, including integration challenges such as lengthy systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping, and difficulties with supplier and customer relationships (page 23). Given the strategic importance of the Compute & Networking segment and its high customer concentration, any disruption caused by acquisition-related integration issues\u2014such as delays or loss of trust with key customers\u2014could materially impact revenue stability and long-term growth in this critical business area.",

Acquisitions or investments involve significant challenges and risks and could impair our ability to grow our business, develop new products or sell our products and ultimately could have a negative impact on our financial results. If we pursue a particular transaction, we may limit our ability to enter into other transactions that could help us achieve our other strategic objectives. If we are unable to timely complete acquisitions, including due to delays and challenges in obtaining regulatory approvals, we may be unable to pursue other transactions, we may not be able to retain critical talent from the target company , technology may evolve and make the acquisition less attractive, and other changes can take place, which could reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction and negatively impact our business. Regulators could also impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value of our acquisitions. In addition, to the extent that our perceived ability to consummate acquisitions  has  been  harmed,  future  acquisitions  may  be  more  difficult,  complex  or  expensive.  Further,  our  investments  in  publicly  traded companies could create volatility in our results and may generate losses up to the value of the investment. In addition, we have invested and may continue to invest  in  priv ate  companies  to  further  our  strategic  objectiv es  and  to  support  certain  key   business  initiativ es.  These  companies  can  include  early -stage companies still defining their strategic direction. M any of the instruments in which we invest are non-marketable and illiquid at the time of our initial investment, and we are not always able to achieve a return. T o the extent any of the companies in which we invest are not successful, we could recognize an impairment and/or lose all or part of our inv estment. Our investment portfolio contains industry sector concentration risks, and a decline in any one or multiple industry sectors could increase our impairment losses.\n\nWe face additional risks related to acquisitions and strategic investments, including the diversion of capital and other resources, including management's attention; difficulty  in realiz ing a satisfactory  return and uncertainties to realiz e the benefits of an acquisition or strategic inv estment, if at all; difficulty  or inability  in obtaining governmental, regulatory approval or restrictions or other consents and approvals or financing; legal proceedings initiated as a result of an acquisition or investment; and potential failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant issues with the assets or company in which we are investing or are acquiring.\n\nAdditional risks related to acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\n- difficulty  in integrating the technology , sy stems, products, policies, processes, or operations and integrating and retaining the employees, including key personnel, of the acquired business;\n- assumption of liabilities and incurring amortization expenses, impairment charges to goodwill or write-downs of acquired assets;\n- integrating accounting, forecasting and controls, procedures and reporting cycles;\n- coordinating and integrating operations, particularly in countries in which we do not currently operate;\n- stock price impact, fines, fees or reputation harm if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval for an acquisition or are otherwise unable to close an acquisition;\n- potential issuances of debt to finance our acquisitions, resulting in increased debt, increased interest expense, and compliance with debt covenants or other restrictions;\n- the potential for our acquisitions to result in dilutiv e issuances of our equity securities;\n- the potential variability  of the amount and form of any performance-based consideration;\n- negative changes in general economic conditions in the regions or the industries in which we or our target operate;\n- exposure to additional cybersecurity risks and vulnerabilities; and\n- impairment of relationships with, or loss of our or our target's employees, vendors and customers.\n\nFor example, when integrating acquisition target systems into our own, we have experienced and may continue to experience challenges including lengthy and costly systems integration, delays in purchasing and shipping products, difficulties with system integration via electronic data interchange and other processes with our key suppliers and customers, and training and change management needs of integration personnel. These challenges have impacted our results of operations and may continue to do so in the future.\n\nWe receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of partners and distributors and we have a concentration of sales to customers who purchase directly or indirectly from us, and our revenue could be adversely affected if we lose or are prevented from selling to any of these customers.\n\nWe have experienced periods where we receive a significant amount of our revenue from a limited number of customers, and this trend may continue. Sales to direct Customers A , B and C represented 12%, 11% and 11% of total revenue, respectively , for fiscal year 2025, all of which were primarily attributable to the Compute &amp; Networking segment.

      "answer": "NVIDIA's inventory provisions rose to $3.7 billion in fiscal year 2025 (up from $2.2 billion in 2024), reflecting the growing complexity of managing product transitions and supply chain volatility. The company notes that increased product cadence and architectural transitions\u2014such as the shift to the Blackwell architecture\u2014have made demand forecasting more difficult and increased the risk of inventory overages and provisions. This is compounded by supply chain challenges, including expanded supplier integration and increased component variability, which elevate inventory levels and the risk of impairments.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n\nThe following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with 'Item 1A . Risk Factors,' our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes thereto, as well as other cautionary statements and risks described elsewhere in this A nnual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to purchase, hold, or sell shares of our common stock.\n\n## Overview\n\n## Our Company and Our Businesses\n\nNVIDIA  pioneered  accelerated  computing  to  help  solve  the  most  challenging  computational  problems.  Since  our  original  focus  on  PC  graphics,  we  have expanded to several other large and important computationally intensive fields. Fueled by the sustained demand for exceptional 3D graphics and the scale of the gaming market, NVIDIA has leveraged its GPU architecture to create platforms for scientific computing, A I, data science, A V , robotics, and digital twin applications.\n\nOur two operating segments are \"Compute &amp; Networking\" and \"Graphics.\" Refer to Note 16 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV , Item 15 of this A nnual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\n\nHeadquartered in Santa Clara, California, NV IDIA  was incorporated in California in A pril 1993 and reincorporated in Delaware in A pril 1998.\n\n## Recent Developments, F uture Objectives and Challenges\n\n## Demand and Supply\n\nRevenue growth in fiscal year 2025 was driven by data center compute and networking platforms for accelerated computing and AI solutions. Demand for our Hopper architecture drove our significant growth for the full year. W e began shipping production systems of the Blackwell architecture in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025.\n\nDemand estimates for our products, applications, and services can be incorrect and create volatility in our revenue or supply levels. We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. A dvancements in accelerated computing and generative A I models, along with the growth in model complexity and scale, have driven increased demand for our Data Center systems.\n\nWe continue to increase our supply and capacity purchases with existing and new suppliers to support our demand projections and increasing complexity of our data center products. With these additions, we have also entered and may continue to enter into prepaid manufacturing and capacity agreements to supply both current and future products. The increased purchase volumes and integration of new suppliers and contract manufacturers into our supply chain creates more complexity in managing multiple suppliers with variations in production planning, execution and logistics. Our expanding product portfolio and varying component compatibility and quality may lead to increased inventory levels. We have incurred and may in the future incur inventory provisions or impairments if our inventory or supply or capacity commitments exceed demand for our products or demand declines.\n\n## Product Transitions and New Product Introductions\n\nProduct transitions are complex and we often ship both new and prior architecture products simultaneously as our channel partners prepare to ship and support new products. We are generally in various stages of transitioning the architectures of our Data Center, Gaming, Professional V isualization, and A utomotive products. The computing industry is experiencing a broader and faster launch cadence of accelerated computing platforms to meet a growing and diverse set of AI opportunities. We have introduced a new product and architecture cadence of our Data Center solutions where we seek to complete new computing solutions each year and provide a greater variety of Data Center offerings. The increased frequency of these transitions and the larger number of products and product configurations may magnify the challenges associated with managing our supply and demand which may further create volatility in our revenue. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in quality or production issues that could increase inventory provisions, warranty , or other costs or result in product delays. W e incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability  to dev elop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost. Customers may delay purchasing existing products as we increase the frequency of new products or may not be able to adopt our new products as fast as forecasted, both impacting the timing of our revenue and supply chain cost. While we have managed prior product transitions and have sold multiple product architectures at the same time, these transitions are difficult, may impair our ability to predict demand and impact our supply mix, and may cause us to incur additional costs.\n\n## Global Trade\n\nIn A ugust 2022, the USG announced licensing requirements that, with certain exceptions, impact exports to China (including Hong Kong and M acau) and Russia of our A 100 and H100 integrated circuits, DGX  or any other systems or boards which incorporate A 100 or H100 integrated circuits.",

Qualification time for  new products, customers anticipating product transitions, and channel partners reducing channel inventory of prior architectures ahead of new product introductions can reduce, or create volatility in, our revenue. We have experienced and may in the future experience reduced demand for current generation architectures  when customers anticipate transitions, and we may be unable to sell multiple product architectures at the same time for current and future architecture transitions. Our financial results have been and may in the future be negatively impacted if we are unable to execute our architectural transitions as planned for any reason. The increased frequency and complexity of newly introduced products could result in unanticipated quality or production issues that could increase the magnitude of inventory provisions, warranty , or other costs or result in product delays. For example, our gross margins in the second quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by inventory provisions for low-yielding Blackwell material.\n\nWe incur significant engineering development resources for new products, and changes to our product roadmap may impact our ability to develop other products or adequately manage our supply chain cost.

We may not be able to generate significant revenue from them. Because our products may be used in multiple use cases and applications, it is difficult to estimate with any reasonable degree of precision the impact of generative A I models on our reported revenue or forecasted demand.\n\nThe use of our GPUs for new, mercurial, or trendy applications, has impacted and can impact in the future demand for our products, including by leading to inconsistent spikes and drops in demand. For example, several years ago, our Gaming GPUs began to be used for mining digital currencies, such as Ethereum.

Cost of revenue also includes acquisition-related intangible amortization expense, costs for license and development and service arrangements, IP-related costs, and stock-based compensation related to personnel associated with manufacturing operations.\n\nGross margins increased to 75.0% in fiscal year 2025 from 72.7% in fiscal year 2024. The year over year increase was primarily driven by a higher mix of Data Center revenue.\n\nProvisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $3.7 billion and $2.2 billion for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively . Sales of previously reserved inventory and settlements of excess inventory purchase obligations resulted in a provision release of $689 million and $540 million for fiscal years 2025 and 2024, respectively.

      "question": "How should investors reconcile the different Digital Media revenue figures reported in Adobe's 10-K, and what does this mean for understanding its growth trajectory?",
      "answer": "Investors should interpret the Digital Media revenue figures by noting that page_42 and page_66 both report $15,547 million in Digital Media revenue for 2024, showing a 12% year-over-year growth compared to $13,838 million in 2023. However, page_43 reports a slightly higher figure of $15,864 million for 2024, with a similar 12% growth from $14,216 million in 2023. This ~2% discrepancy ($317M) between the tables in page_42/page_66 and page_43 indicates potential differences in reporting timing, categorization, or revision between sections. Despite this difference, both sections agree on the consistent 12% growth rate, and page_43 further contextualizes Digital Media as representing 74% of Adobe\u2019s total revenue in 2024. This suggests that while there may be minor inconsistencies in how the metric is presented, the underlying growth trend remains strong and central to Adobe's overall revenue model.",

      "answer": "Adobe strategically emphasizes AI integration in the Digital Media segment to enhance creativity and productivity, as seen in offerings like Adobe GenStudio and Adobe Firefly, which are part of Creative Cloud and Document Cloud.

ARR is calculated with constant currency rates for consistency, indicating a long-term view of segment performance. Meanwhile, Adobe's revenue recognition practices for product and service offerings\u2014such as point-in-time recognition for perpetual software licenses and ratable recognition for support contracts\u2014complement the recurring nature of ARR, supporting a stable and predictable revenue stream that underpins the investment in forward-looking AI capabilities.",

      "answer": "Adobe's Digital Experience segment strategically emphasizes AI-driven personalization capabilities through Adobe Experience Platform, which transforms customer data into real-time profiles augmented with AI-driven insights to deliver one-to-one personalization (page_7). This aligns with the competitive differentiation factors listed, such as 'integration and customization of high-quality AI models' and 'near real-time data and reporting' (page_9), which Adobe highlights as key advantages over competitors. The revenue recognition approach for this segment further supports this strategy, as Adobe recognizes revenue for services like consulting and advertising on a usage or performance basis, allowing customers to align costs with actual value realization from these AI-enhanced personalization services rather than fixed licensing fees (page_42). This combination of AI-powered differentiation and flexible revenue recognition creates a value-based model that supports Adobe's strategic positioning in customer journey management.",

      "answer": "NVIDIA's Compute & Networking segment is strategically centered on growth areas such as AI, autonomous driving, networking, and cloud solutions (page_78), which align with its Data Center revenue growth of 217% contributing to a 72.7% gross margin in fiscal 2024 (page_40). However, this growth is partially offset by significant risks: the segment is exposed to a 13% revenue concentration from Customer A (page_23), which introduces dependency risk, and the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal 2023 (page_40) highlights the financial and strategic risks of pursuing expansion through acquisitions. The segment's reliance on a few large customers and the financial impact of failed strategic investments suggest a tension between pursuing growth through innovation in key markets and managing execution and dependency risks.",

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's increased supply chain complexity and product transition cadence impact their inventory provisions, and how is this reflected in both their gross margin performance and forward-looking risk assessments?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA's increased supply chain complexity and faster product transition cadence have led to greater execution risk and potential inventory provisions. In fiscal year 2024, provisions for inventory and excess inventory purchase obligations totaled $2.2 billion, with a net unfavorable impact of 2.7% on gross margin. This reflects the financial cost of managing supply-demand mismatches, particularly during transitions like the Hopper architecture ramp-up and anticipation of next-gen products. Looking forward, NVIDIA acknowledges that shortening product development cycles and integrating new suppliers may increase the likelihood of inventory provisions or impairments if demand declines or supply commitments exceed actual sales. The company also notes that increased product introduction frequency magnifies supply chain challenges, potentially increasing inventory provisions, warranty costs, or production delays.",

      "question": "How does Broadcom's divestiture of the EUC business for $3.5 billion reflect strategic realignment when considering the timing of the VMware acquisition, the presentation of EUC in discontinued operations, and the use of proceeds from the EUC sale in the context of Broadcom's broader capital allocation strategy?",
      "answer": "Broadcom acquired VMware on November 22, 2023, for $53.4 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction, signaling a major strategic shift toward infrastructure software. However, as part of this acquisition, Broadcom retained the End-User Computing (EUC) business, which it later sold to KKR & Co. Inc. on July 1, 2024, for $3.5 billion after working capital adjustments. This divestiture is consistent with Broadcom's strategy to focus on core infrastructure software and semiconductor businesses, as the EUC business was not aligned with Broadcom's strategic objectives. The proceeds from the EUC sale likely contributed to Broadcom's capital allocation efforts, which included paying $9,814 million in cash dividends and repurchasing $7,176 million of common stock during fiscal year 2024. Additionally, the EUC business is presented in discontinued operations, indicating that Broadcom has no material continuing involvement with the business post-sale. This strategic move reflects Broadcom's intent to streamline its portfolio and focus on higher-margin, scalable software and semiconductor operations.",

      "question": "How does Broadcom's acquisition of VMware and subsequent divestiture of its EUC business impact the strategic positioning and financial commitments of the Infrastructure Software segment, especially in light of its $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations?",
      "answer": "Broadcom's acquisition of VMware for $53.4 billion in cash and stock significantly expanded the Infrastructure Software segment by integrating VMware's capabilities in cloud and infrastructure software. However, the subsequent divestiture of VMware's EUC business for $3.5 billion suggests a strategic refocusing on core infrastructure software offerings. This is supported by the segment's $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations as of November 3, 2024, which indicates strong forward-looking revenue commitments, with approximately 43% expected to convert to revenue within the next 12 months. Together, these actions signal a deliberate effort to consolidate and monetize high-value infrastructure software assets while aligning the segment\u2019s offerings with long-term enterprise and cloud-focused demand.",

      "question": "How does Broadcom's acquisition of VMware and subsequent divestiture of EUC, combined with its remaining performance obligations in the semiconductor solutions segment, reflect the company's dependency on concentrated customer relationships and long-term revenue commitments?",
      "answer": "Broadcom's acquisition of VMware for $53.4 billion in a cash-and-stock transaction and the subsequent divestiture of the EUC business for $3.5 billion reflect strategic moves to consolidate and refocus its portfolio. Despite these large-scale changes, the semiconductor solutions segment remains heavily influenced by concentrated customer relationships, as evidenced by one customer accounting for 28% of net revenue in fiscal year 2024. Furthermore, the segment has $20.5 billion in remaining performance obligations as of November 3, 2024, with approximately 43% expected to be recognized within the next 12 months. This indicates that while Broadcom is reshaping its business through acquisitions and divestitures, it continues to rely on a few key customers and long-term contractual commitments to drive semiconductor revenue, highlighting a dual dependency on both customer concentration and binding performance obligations.",

      "answer": "AMD recognized a $12 million licensing gain in 2021, as disclosed in both the consolidated balance sheets on page 47 and the multi-year income statement on page 52. This gain is directly tied to the intellectual property (IP) licensing agreement with the THATIC JV, a joint venture with Higon Information Technology Co., Ltd., as detailed on page 64. In 2019, AMD had recognized a significantly larger $60 million licensing gain from the same agreement, indicating that the income is milestone-based and tied to the THATIC JV's progress on products developed using AMD's IP. The 2021 gain represents royalty income under the same agreement, showing that the licensing gain line item is a direct result of ongoing IP monetization through this joint venture.",

        "Hop 3: AMD (page 64) \u2190 Licensing Gain: AMD attributes the licensing gains to a 2016 IP licensing agreement with the THATIC JV, under which it receives milestone payments and ongoing royalties."

      "answer": "AMD's current portion of long-term debt was $312 million as of December 25, 2021, as shown in both the balance sheet (page_54) and the detailed debt schedule (page_65). This amount is nearly the entirety of the company's total debt of $313 million, indicating a significant portion of debt is due within the next year. However, the fair value of long-term debt net of current portion was only $1 million, suggesting that the company's long-term debt is minimal after accounting for the near-term maturity.

      "answer": "Document Cloud revenue grew from $1.50 billion in fiscal 2020 to $1.97 billion in fiscal 2021, representing a 32% year-over-year increase. During the same period, Document Cloud ARR increased from $1.47 billion to $1.93 billion, indicating strong new user acquisition and retention. The consistency between the growth in reported revenue and ARR suggests that Adobe\u2019s Document Cloud revenue gains are underpinned by recurring subscription commitments, supporting the sustainability of its growth trajectory.",

In  our  Digital  Experience  segment,  we  continued  to  experience growth in software-based subscription revenue across our portfolio of offerings. Our financial results for fiscal 2021 benefited from an extra week in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 due to our 52/53 week financial calendar whereby fiscal 2021 is a 53-week year compared with fiscal 2020 and 2019 which were 52-week years.\n\n## Digital Media\n\nIn our Digital Media segment, we are a market leader with Creative Cloud, our subscription-based offering which provides desktop tools, mobile apps and cloud-based services for designing, creating and publishing rich and immersive content. Creative Cloud  delivers  value  with  deep,  cross-product  integration,  frequent  product  updates  and  feature  enhancements,  cloud-enabled services  including  storage  and  syncing  of  files  across  users'  machines,  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence,  access  to marketplace,  social  and  community-based  features  with  our Adobe  Stock  and  Behance  services,  app  creation  capabilities,  tools which assist with enterprise deployments and team collaboration, and affordable pricing for cost-sensitive customers.\n\nWe offer Creative Cloud for individuals,  students,  teams  and  enterprises. We  expect  Creative  Cloud  will  drive  sustained long-term  revenue  growth  through  a  continued  expansion  of  our  customer  base  by  attracting  new  users  with  new  features  and products, continuing to acquire users with our low cost of entry and delivery of additional features and value to Creative Cloud, and delivering new features and technologies to existing customers with our latest releases. We have also built out a marketplace for Creative Cloud subscribers to enable the delivery and purchase of stock content in our Adobe Stock service. Overall, our strategy with  Creative  Cloud  is  designed  to  enable  us  to  increase  our  revenue  with  users,  attract  more  new  customers,  and  grow  our recurring and predictable revenue stream that is recognized ratably.\n\nWe continue to implement strategies that are designed to accelerate awareness, consideration and purchase of subscriptions to our Creative Cloud offerings. These strategies include increasing the value Creative Cloud users receive, such as offering new desktop  and  mobile  applications,  as  well  as  targeted  promotions  and  offers  that  attract  past  customers  and  potential  users  to experience and ultimately subscribe to Creative Cloud. Because of the shift towards Creative Cloud subscriptions and Enterprise Term  License Agreements  ('ETLAs'),  revenue  from  perpetual  licensing  of  our  Creative  products  has  been  immaterial  to  our business.\n\nIn October 2021, we acquired Frame.io, a privately held company that provides a cloud-based video collaboration platform, and we began integrating Frame.io into our Digital Media segment.\n\nWe  are  also  a  market  leader  with  our  Document  Cloud  offerings  built  around  our  Adobe  Acrobat  family  of  products, including Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, and a set of integrated mobile apps and cloud-based document services, including Adobe Scan  and  Adobe  Sign.  Acrobat  provides  reliable  creation  and  exchange  of  electronic  documents,  regardless  of  platform  or application source type. Document Cloud, which we believe enhances the way people manage critical documents at home, in the office and across devices, includes Adobe Acrobat DC and Adobe Sign, and a set of integrated services enabling users to create, review, approve, sign and track documents whether on a desktop or mobile device. Adobe Acrobat DC is offered both through subscription and perpetual licenses.\n\nAs part of our Creative Cloud and Document Cloud strategies, we utilize a data-driven operating model ('DDOM') and our Adobe Experience Cloud solutions to raise awareness of our products, drive new customer acquisition, engagement and retention, and optimize customer journeys. As a result, we observed strong growth in Digital Media revenue during fiscal 2021.\n\nAnnualized Recurring Revenue ('ARR') is currently the key performance metric our management uses to assess the health and  trajectory  of  our  overall  Digital  Media  segment.  ARR  should  be  viewed  independently  of  revenue,  deferred  revenue  and remaining performance obligations as ARR is a performance metric and is not intended to be combined with any of these items. We adjust our reported ARR on an annual basis to reflect any exchange rate changes. Our reported ARR results in the",

Trillions of PDF documents are created every year, which reflects the growing role PDF plays across practically every segment of the economy, and there are hundreds of millions of users that engage with PDF files on a daily basis, in industries such as legal, financial services and publishing, as well as a broader array of communicators and Acrobat Reader users, who can also use the expanded capabilities provided by our Acrobat applications and the document services platform found in Document Cloud.\n\n## Strategy\n\nOur goal for our Digital Media business is to be the leading platform for creativity and digital document solutions, where we offer  a  range  of  products  and  services  that  allow  individuals,  teams,  small  and  medium  businesses,  enterprises  and  government institutions,  including  both  professionals  and  enthusiasts,  to  design  and  deliver  content  seamlessly.  With  content  creation, consumption and monetization happening across all surfaces and media types, we aim to deliver new ways to unleash creativity and accelerate document productivity, and we believe this is an area of significant opportunity for growth through expansion of our customer base. We aim to achieve this by using data-driven customer engagement, driving product-led growth through innovation to make our creative applications more accessible and easier to learn and meeting customer needs holistically to increase the value of our products.\n\nWe continue to redefine the creative process with Creative Cloud, so that our customers can connect with everything and everyone they need to create, collaborate and be inspired. We are empowering content-first, task-based creativity with our launch of Creative Cloud Express, a web and mobile application with a content- and template-first experience to enable a broad spectrum of users, including novice content creators, communicators and creative professionals, to create, edit and customize content quickly and easily, in December 2021. We aim to continue to advance every creative category across desktop, web and mobile. We have delivered our flagship applications, including Photoshop, Illustrator and Lightroom, on desktop and mobile devices to allow users the ability to work from anywhere on any device and to collaborate with stakeholders. We are building collaboration deeply into our applications and workflows to enable seamless collaboration across stakeholders. We are taking Creative Cloud to the web, beginning with a public beta version of Photoshop, which will allow Creative Cloud subscribers to make edits to and collaborate on their files directly in their browser. We are continuing to focus on democratizing 3D and immersive content creation with Adobe Aero and our Substance suite of products, as well as through integrating our Substance 3D capabilities into our other applications. We continue to introduce new features and solutions in our products, such as auto-masking and new and improved neural filters in Photoshop, auto-captioning in Premiere, adjustment layers and perspective grids in Adobe Fresco and additional motion features in Adobe  XD. We  are  pursuing  new  ways  to  inspire,  empower  and  connect  the  creative  community,  such  as  through  our  Create Change series, our creative residency program and supporting live, interactive tutorials with creators on Behance. We also offer a range  of  other  creative  tools  and  services,  including  hobbyist  products,  such  as  Photoshop  Elements  and  Premiere  Elements; libraries  of  creative  assets,  such  as Adobe  Stock  and Adobe  Fonts;  mobile-first  apps,  such  as  Photoshop  Camera;  and  Creative Cloud Libraries, a central place for users to store their assets. Further descriptions of our Digital Media products are included below under 'Principal Products and Services.'\n\nOn October 7, 2021, Adobe acquired Frame.io and began integrating its leading cloud-based video collaboration platform into  Adobe  Creative  Cloud.  With  the  acquisition  of  Frame.io,  we  aim  to  make  the  creative  process  even  more  collaborative, productive  and  efficient  by  enhancing  Adobe  Creative  Cloud  with  Frame.io's  cloud-native  collaboration  workflows,  while continuing  to  enable  third-party  applications.  As  a  first  step  in  this  direction,  we  are  more  deeply  integrating  and  enhancing Frame.io's review and approval capabilities in Premiere Pro and After Effects to deliver a native collaborative platform for video editing.\n\nIn our Creative Cloud business, we continue to employ a pricing strategy, as appropriate, to move our customers to bettervalue offerings as well as attract past customers and potential users to try out our products and ultimately subscribe. As part of our strategy, we use a data-driven operating model and our Digital Experience solutions offered through Adobe",

      "question": "How does the growth trajectory of Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment, as reflected in both historical and forward-looking financial data, align with the company's workforce allocation and strategic emphasis on cloud operations?",
      "answer": "The Intelligent Cloud segment reported revenue of $21,563 million in fiscal year 2023 (page_84) and showed a slight increase in capital allocation with $223 million in acquisitions during the same year (page_78), indicating active investment in growth. Despite this, the segment\u2019s forward-looking allocation remained flat at $30,441 million by June 30, 2024, suggesting a cautious or stabilized investment approach. Meanwhile, the company employed 228,000 full-time employees as of June 30, 2024, with 86,000 dedicated to operations, including datacenter operations\u2014a core function of the Intelligent Cloud. This workforce allocation underscores the operational intensity and strategic importance of the cloud segment, aligning with its financial positioning and investment activity.",

      "answer": "The 50% increase in Xbox Content and Services revenue was primarily driven by the 44 percentage-point net impact from the Activision Blizzard acquisition, as noted in both the More Personal Computing segment results and the MD&A overview. Additionally, the revenue definition on page 42 clarifies that Xbox content includes first-party content like Activision Blizzard, subscriptions (e.g., Xbox Game Pass), and other services, which aligns with the acquisition-driven growth. The segment performance also notes that this growth was partially offset by a decline in Xbox hardware revenue, which fell 13% due to lower console sales.",

      "answer": "Accenture's Health & Public Service segment demonstrated strong growth in fiscal 2024, with a 10% increase in revenue both in U.S. dollars and local currency (from $12,560 million in 2023 to $13,841 million in 2024), as reported in the industry group financials. This growth aligns with the company's strategic emphasis on industry-specific capabilities, as stated in the Business Overview (page 5), which highlights an integrated go-to-market model leveraging over 100 innovation hubs and ecosystem relationships. Additionally, the $6.6 billion in fiscal 2024 investments across 46 strategic acquisitions likely contributed to this performance by enhancing domain-specific offerings and delivery capabilities. While the filings do not explicitly attribute the segment's growth to specific acquisitions, the temporal alignment and Accenture\u2019s stated strategy of building industry-focused digital capabilities suggest a strategic fit between investment priorities and segment outcomes.",

      "answer": "Accenture incurred business optimization costs of $438 million in fiscal 2024 and $1,063 million in fiscal 2023, which significantly impacted their financial metrics. These costs reduced diluted earnings per share by $0.51 in fiscal 2024 and $1.28 in fiscal 2023, resulting in adjusted diluted EPS of $11.95 and $11.67, respectively. On the operating margin side, the exclusion of these costs contributed to an adjusted operating margin of 15.5% in fiscal 2024 compared to 15.4% in fiscal 2023, showing marginal improvement. Management emphasizes these adjusted metrics to evaluate performance by removing the impact of these one-time costs, facilitating period-to-period comparisons and highlighting underlying business trends.",

      "question": "How does the decline in Consulting revenue as a percentage of total revenues align with the drop in Consulting new bookings growth and the overall flat performance in total Consulting revenue year-over-year?",
      "answer": "Consulting revenue remained relatively flat year-over-year at $33.2 billion in 2024 compared to $33.6 billion in 2023, representing a 1% decrease in U.S. dollars. This stagnation is reflected in new bookings growth for Consulting, which only increased by 2% in 2024. Additionally, Consulting\u2019s share of total revenues dropped from 52% in 2023 to 51% in 2024, signaling a slight shift in the company\u2019s revenue mix toward Managed Services. Together, these metrics indicate a softening in demand or pricing pressure in the Consulting segment despite overall revenue stability.",

      "question": "What does the combination of year-over-year growth, margin trends, and revenue composition reveal about the trajectory and profitability of Adobe's Digital Experience segment compared to its other business lines?",
      "answer": "Adobe's Digital Experience revenue grew by 12% year-over-year in fiscal 2023, matching the growth rate of the larger Digital Media segment. However, while Digital Media maintains a high gross margin of 95%, Digital Experience operates at a significantly lower gross margin of 67%, as seen in the financial breakdown. This reveals that while Digital Experience is growing at the same rate as Adobe\u2019s core business, it contributes less profit per revenue dollar. When compared to the smaller Publishing and Advertising segment\u2014which also has a 67% gross margin but is declining at 7% annually\u2014Digital Experience stands out as a key growth driver despite its relatively lower profitability. This paints a picture of a promising but less mature business line that requires careful investment to improve margins.",

This revenue growth was supported by a significant increase in Document Cloud ARR, which rose to $2.81 billion at the end of fiscal 2023 from $2.28 billion the prior year. The Document Cloud's strong performance within the Digital Media segment indicates its growing role in Adobe's subscription-driven revenue model, contributing to the company's overall financial predictability and recurring revenue base.",

      "answer": "Adobe measures Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR) using constant currency rates set at the beginning of each fiscal year, which provides a consistent metric for assessing the Digital Media segment's health. However, actual revenue recognized under GAAP can fluctuate due to foreign currency exchange rate movements, impacting financial results despite stable ARR figures. Adobe acknowledges these currency risks and attempts to mitigate them through hedging, although these efforts may not fully offset adverse impacts.

      "question": "What were the primary drivers of Intel's 20% DCAI revenue decline in 2023, and how did competitive pressures and cloud service provider dynamics contribute to this drop?",
      "answer": "Intel's DCAI revenue declined by 20% in 2023 due to a combination of competitive pressures and shifts in cloud service provider dynamics. According to page 7, the decline was attributed to lower server volume caused by a softening CPU data center market, partially offset by higher ASPs from a lower mix of hyperscale customer-related revenue and a higher mix of high core count products. Page 50 highlights that the competitive environment, including the shift of customer spend toward GPUs and increased competition from companies like AMD and NVIDIA, negatively impacted DCAI revenue, platform ASPs, and market share over recent years. Page 62 further explains that the increasing purchasing power of hyperscalers and the shift of data center workloads to the public cloud intensified competitive pressures, eroding Intel's position and directly affecting DCAI results in 2023. Together, these factors illustrate how both external market shifts and internal competitive challenges led to the significant revenue drop.",

      "question": "How does Intel's fluctuation in product margin across server, notebook/desktop, and NEX segments reflect the interplay between revenue declines, unit cost increases, and period charges, and what does this reveal about the company's overall margin pressures in 2023?",
      "answer": "Intel's product margin was negatively impacted across multiple business segments in 2023. In the server segment (page_29), the $2,709 million decline in product margin was primarily due to lower server revenue and higher unit costs driven by the increased mix of Intel 7 products ($1,269 million). In the notebook/desktop segment (page_26), product margin declined by $1,704 million due to lower notebook and desktop revenue, with $385 million attributed to higher unit costs from Intel 7. In the NEX segment (page_32), product margin dropped $1,832 million driven by lower revenue across NEX product lines. These consistent margin pressures across segments, despite cost-cutting efforts, indicate systemic challenges in maintaining profitability amid product transitions and demand volatility.",

      "question": "How does Intel's financial performance, strategic risk disclosures, and capital allocation decisions collectively reflect the implications of exiting the NAND memory business?",
      "answer": "Intel's financial performance in 2023 shows a continued absence of the NAND memory business, which had previously contributed a loss of $4,306 million in 2021. The strategic risk disclosures highlight the company's recognition of the business's lack of profitability and its decision to exit as part of a broader portfolio optimization under the IDM 2.0 strategy. Intel's capital allocation decisions emphasize a disciplined approach, with a focus on reinvesting in core capabilities and unlocking value through divestitures like the NAND memory business, which aligns with its shift away from non-core, unprofitable ventures.",

        "Hop 1: [INTC](page_49) \u2192 [NAND Memory Business]: Financial data shows the NAND memory business contributed a $4,306 million loss in 2021 and was no longer present in 2023, indicating its exit.",
        "Hop 2: [INTC](page_53) \u2192 [NAND Memory Business]: Risk disclosures note that the NAND memory business was wound down due to a lack of profitability and strategic fit, reflecting broader risks around business changes and investments.",
        "Hop 3: [INTC](page_13) \u2192 [NAND Memory Business]: Capital allocation strategy explicitly references the exit from the NAND memory business as part of portfolio optimization efforts to focus on core, strategic investments."

      "answer": "The Network and Edge segment experienced a significant decline in both revenue (from $8.41B to $5.77B) and operating performance (from $1.03B profit to $482M loss) in 2023. Despite this deterioration, Intel maintained flat capital allocation to the segment at $2.81B, contrasting with the strategic integration of AXG into CCG and DCAI that was intended to reduce costs and improve efficiency. This suggests Intel may be prioritizing continued investment in Network and Edge despite its underperformance, potentially to stabilize the business following structural changes and market challenges.",

      "answer": "Accenture's outsourcing revenues grew by 19% in dollar terms, driven by strong performance across all geographic markets, including North America ($29.1B total revenue), Europe ($20.3B), and Growth Markets ($12.2B), each of which experienced double-digit growth. Despite this overall growth, the mix of outsourcing revenues is not uniform across regions due to localized market conditions and client demand. Additionally, Accenture apportions revenues from multi-geographic contracts among participating regions, which further influences the reported outsourcing revenue in each market. This complexity, combined with differing regional dynamics and the customized nature of service contracts, explains the nuanced growth pattern in outsourcing revenues across markets.",

          "chunk_text": "As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.\n\n## Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market\n\nOur three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets. In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.\n\nFrom time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.\n\nWhile we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.",

      "answer": "Accenture's Health & Public Service segment reported $11.2 billion in fiscal 2022 revenue, representing 18% of total company revenue and an 18% year-over-year growth in U.S. dollars. Within this segment, 66% of revenue came from Public Service and 34% from Health, with a notable 35% of the segment\u2019s revenue derived from U.S. federal government work through Accenture Federal Services. Geographically, the segment aligns with Accenture\u2019s broader regional performance, where North America grew by 23% and contributed significantly to overall revenue increases. This indicates that the Health & Public Service segment is both strategically diversified across sub-industries and regionally aligned with Accenture\u2019s strongest growth markets.",

      "answer": "The 25% growth in consulting revenues outpaces the 23% growth in North America and 21% growth in Europe, indicating that consulting services were a key driver of regional expansion. This growth pattern aligns with the company's explanation that it cannot standardize volume or price measurement across its services, as each consulting contract is customized with unique deliverables and pricing structures. The lack of uniformity in service delivery and pricing, as noted in the report, supports the variation in growth rates across regions and types of work, highlighting the complexity in attributing growth to specific factors like volume or price changes.",

          "chunk_text": "As a matter of course, we are regularly audited by various taxing authorities, and sometimes these audits result in proposed assessments where the ultimate resolution may result in us owing additional taxes. We establish tax liabilities or reduce tax assets when, despite our belief that our tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, we believe we may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, we determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Our estimate of the ultimate tax liability contains assumptions based on past experiences, judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions as well as judgments about the likely outcome of issues that have been raised by taxing jurisdictions. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon settlement. We evaluate tax positions each quarter and adjust the related tax liabilities or assets in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of a tax audit or the expiration of a statute of limitations. We believe the estimates and assumptions used to support our evaluation of tax positions are reasonable. However, final determinations of prior-year tax liabilities, either by settlement with tax authorities or expiration of statutes of limitations, could be materially different from estimates reflected in assets and liabilities and historical income tax provisions. The outcome of these final determinations could have a material effect on our income tax provision, net income, or cash flows in the period in which that determination is made. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and that we have adequately accounted for these positions.\n\n## Revenues by Segment/Geographic Market\n\nOur three reportable operating segments are our geographic markets, North America, Europe and Growth Markets. In addition to reporting revenues by geographic market and industry group, we also report revenues by two types of work: consulting and outsourcing, which represent the services sold by our geographic markets. Consulting revenues, which include strategy, management and technology consulting and technology integration consulting, reflect a finite, distinct project or set of projects with a defined outcome and typically a defined set of specific deliverables. Outsourcing revenues typically reflect ongoing, repeatable services or capabilities provided to transition, run and/or manage operations of client systems or business functions.\n\nFrom time to time, our geographic markets work together to sell and implement certain contracts. The resulting revenues and costs from these contracts may be apportioned among the participating geographic markets. Generally, operating expenses for each geographic market have similar characteristics and are subject to the same factors, pressures and challenges. However, the economic environment and its effects on the industries served by our geographic markets affect revenues and operating expenses within our geographic markets to differing degrees. The mix between consulting and outsourcing is not uniform among our geographic markets. Local currency fluctuations also tend to affect our geographic markets differently, depending on the geographic concentrations and locations of their businesses.\n\nWhile we provide discussion about our results of operations below, we cannot measure how much of our revenue growth in a particular period is attributable to changes in price or volume. Management does not track standard measures of unit or rate volume. Instead, our measures of volume and price are extremely complex, as each of our services contracts is unique, reflecting a customized mix of specific services that does not fit into standard comparability measurements. Revenue for our services is a function of the nature of each service to be provided, the skills required and the outcome sought, as well as estimated cost, risk, contract terms and other factors.",

      "question": "How does Intel's competitive challenge from cloud service providers developing custom semiconductors align with the 1% decline in DCG revenue in 2021 and their $18.7 billion capital investment strategy?",
      "answer": "Intel's DCG revenue declined by 1% in 2021, primarily due to lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, especially from cloud service providers who are increasingly developing their own semiconductors (page_40). This competitive pressure is acknowledged as a key risk factor on page_65, where it's noted that some cloud service providers have internally developed custom chips, and that the abstraction of hardware under layers of software makes product differentiation more difficult. In response, Intel has committed $18.7 billion in capital investments to support its IDM 2.0 strategy, aiming to regain product leadership and long-term growth by increasing manufacturing capacity and accelerating its process technology roadmap (page_6).",

          "chunk_text": "Industry trends, such as the increasing shift of data center workloads to the public cloud, have increased the significance and purchasing power of certain customers, particularly cloud service providers, in some of our data center-focused businesses. The cloud and cloud applications represent a new and increasingly demanding computing environment. The further consolidation of computing workloads in the cloud, and consolidation among cloud service providers, can heighten the competitive importance of factors such as collaboration and customization with cloud service provider customers to optimize products for their environments; optimization for cloud services and applications; product performance; energy efficiency; feature differentiation; product quality, reliability, and factors affecting server uptime; and product security and security features. Our competitive position can be eroded to the extent we do not execute effectively across these factors. We are operating in an increasingly competitive environment, including in serving cloud service provider customers, and the competitive environment adversely affected our results in DCG in 2021.\n\nSome cloud service provider customers have also internally developed, and may continue to develop, their own semiconductors, including designs customized for their specific computing workloads. In addition, cloud services can be marketed to end users based on service levels or features rather than hardware specifications, or they can abstract hardware under layers of software, which can make it more difficult to differentiate our products to customers and end users. The shift of data center workloads to the cloud has also adversely affected, and may continue to affect, sales to enterprise and government market segment customers when end users have elected to migrate workloads. To the extent we differentiate our products through customization to meet cloud customer specifications, order changes, delays, or cancellations may result in non-recoverable costs.\n\nThe loss of a key customer, a substantial reduction in sales to them, or changes in the timing of their orders can lead to a reduction in our revenue, increase the volatility of our results, and harm our results of operations and financial condition. For more information about our customers, including customers who accounted for greater than 10% of our net consolidated revenue, see \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nWe face risks related to transactions with government entities. We receive proceeds from US federal, state, local, and foreign government entities associated with grants, incentives, and sales of our products and services. Government demand and payment are often affected by public sector budgetary cycles and funding authorizations, including, with respect to US government contracts, congressional approval of appropriations. Government contracts are subject to procurement laws and regulations relating to the award, administration, and performance of those contracts, as well as oversight and penalties for violations. For example, certain agreements with the US government are subject to special rules on accounting, IP rights, expenses, reviews, information handling, security, and/or employees, and failure to comply with these rules could result in civil and criminal penalties and sanctions, including termination of contracts, fines, and suspension or debarment from future business with the US government.\n\n## Changes in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income.\n\nA number of factors can increase our effective tax rate, which could reduce our net income, including:\n\n- changes in the volume and mix of profits earned and location of assets across jurisdictions with varying tax rates;\n- the resolution of issues arising from tax audits, including payment of interest and penalties;\n- changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, and in deferred tax valuation allowances;\n- adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of tax returns;\n- increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill;\n- changes in available tax credits;\n- changes in our ability to secure new, or renew existing, tax holidays and incentives;\n- changes in US federal, state, or foreign tax laws or their interpretation, including changes in the US to the taxation of manufacturing enterprises and of non-US income and expenses and changes resulting from the adoption by countries of OECD recommendations or other legislative actions;\n- changes in accounting standards; and\n- our decision to repatriate non-US earnings for which we have not previously provided for local country withholding taxes incurred upon repatriation.\n\n## We have fluctuations in the amount and frequency of our stock repurchases.\n\nWe are not obligated to make repurchases under our stock repurchase program. The amount, timing, and execution of our repurchases fluctuate based on factors that include prioritizing cash for other purposes, such as investing in our business, including operational spending, capital spending, and acquisitions, and returning cash to our stockholders as dividend payments. Our stock repurchase program may be suspended or terminated at any time. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that repurchases will enhance long-term stockholder value. We expect our future stock repurchases to be significantly below our levels from the last few years.",

CCG revenue grew 1% due to continued strength in notebook demand and recovery in desktop demand, partially offset by lower notebook ASPs due to strength in the consumer and education market segments. CCG adjacent revenue decreased primarily due to the continued ramp down from the exit of our 5G smartphone modem and Home Gateway Platform businesses. IOTG and Mobileye were both up 33% and 43%, respectively, on higher demand amid recovery from the economic impacts of COVID-19. DCG revenue decreased 1% primarily due to lower ASPs driven by product mix and a competitive environment, partially offset by higher platform volume from recovery in the enterprise and government market segment.

Our DCG revenue grew 11% due to increased platform volume as cloud service providers increased capacity to serve customer demand. We also saw continued growth in DCG communications service providers, partially offset by enterprise and government decline. We saw growth in DCG adjacencies driven by 5G networking deployment and saw improved NAND pricing and higher demand in NSG, partially offset by weaker core mix and higher demand in IOTG platform products due to COVID-19. Our CCG revenue was up 8% year over year driven by strength in notebook and Wi-Fi sales. That growth was slightly offset by lower desktop volume and lower notebook ASPs resulting from higher demand for consumer and education PCs, and volume decline in LTE modem and connected home following the exit of those businesses.",

Free cash flow decreased due to lower operating cash flow and higher capital expenditures.\n\n## Investing in our IDM 2.0 strategy for the long term\n\nTo support our IDM 2.0 strategy, we are making significant capital investments to increase our manufacturing capacity and accelerate our process technology roadmap, as well as increasing our investments in R&amp;D. We believe these investments will position us for accelerating long-term revenue growth. We expect our long-term revenue outlook to accelerate to a 10% to 12% year-over-year growth rate by the end of our five-year horizon as supply normalizes and our investments add capacity and drive leadership products. We expect gross margins to be impacted by our investments in capacity and the acceleration of our process technology, resulting in expected non-GAAP gross margins percentages between 51% and 53%  over the next several years before moving upward. We also expect our capital expenditures to increase above historical levels for the next several years. We expect our cash from operations to be strong, but our capital investments to pressure our free cash flow in the short term. 2\n\n- See \"Our Products\" within MD&amp;A. 1\n- See \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" within MD&amp;A. 2",

We believe these adjustments provide investors with a useful view, through the eyes of management, of the company's core business model and how management currently evaluates core operational performance. We believe they also provide investors with an additional means to understand the potential impact of the divestiture over time. In making these adjustments, we have not made any changes to our methods for measuring and calculating revenue or other |\n| Acquisition-related adjustments  | Amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets consists of amortization of intangible assets such as developed technology, brands, and customer relationships acquired in connection with business combinations. Charges related to the amortization of these intangibles are recorded within both cost of sales and MG&Ain our US GAAP financial statements. Amortization charges are recorded over the estimated useful life of the related acquired intangible asset, and thus are generally recorded over multiple years. | We exclude amortization charges for our acquisition-related intangible assets for purposes of calculating certain non-GAAP measures because these charges are inconsistent in size and are significantly impacted by the timing and valuation of our acquisitions. These adjustments facilitate a useful evaluation of our current operating performance and comparison to our past operating performance and provide investors with additional means to evaluate cost and expense trends.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Such governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings could require us to change our patent licensing practices, as described herein in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. '\n\nQSI Segment. QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including but not limited to 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business and our cloud computing processing initiative. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax , contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio.

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

      "question": "How did the change in AMD's licensing gains from the THATIC JV between 2022 and 2023 impact its operating income and ability to offset operating losses?",
      "answer": "In 2022, AMD recognized $102 million in licensing gains from the THATIC JV, which contributed to an operating income of $1,264 million. By 2023, this licensing gain dropped significantly to $34 million, coinciding with a decline in operating income to $401 million. At the same time, AMD's operating loss increased from $4,979 million in 2022 to $4,419 million in 2023. This reduction in licensing gains likely weakened AMD's ability to offset its substantial operating losses, particularly as amortization of acquisition-related intangibles remained high at $2,811 million in 2023. The decline in licensing revenue from $102 million to $34 million appears to have contributed to the worsening operating loss position despite lower amortization costs compared to the prior year.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: AMD (page_70) \u2192 Licensing Gain: Reports licensing gain as a negative item in operating loss, showing a decrease from ($102M in 2022) to ($34M in 2023), contributing to a $4,419M operating loss in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: AMD (page_57) \u2192 Licensing Gain: Licensing gain appears as a reduction in operating expenses, directly impacting operating income which fell from $1,264M in 2022 to $401M in 2023, reflecting the decline in licensing revenue.",
        "Hop 3: AMD (page_53) \u2192 Licensing Gain: Details show $34M in 2023 licensing gain came from royalty income with THATIC JV, down from $102M in 2022, which included both milestone and royalty payments."

      "question": "How does AMD's disclosure of Marketing, General and Administrative expenses in the stock-based compensation breakout compare with the total MG&A figures presented in the consolidated income statement and operating metrics section, particularly noting that the stock-based component amounts to $352 million while the total MG&A expenses are reported at $2,352 million in both the income statement and operating metrics?",
      "answer": "AMD's disclosure reveals that the $2,352 million in total Marketing, General and Administrative (MG&A) expenses reported in both the consolidated income statement (page 57) and the operating metrics section (page 52) includes a wide range of expenditures beyond just stock-based compensation. Specifically, the stock-based component of MG&A expenses is detailed as $352 million on page 84, indicating that this is only a fraction of the total MG&A outlay. This distinction highlights how AMD categorizes and reports its expenses in different contexts: the stock-based compensation breakout isolates a specific type of non-cash expense, while the consolidated income statement and operating metrics present the full cash and non-cash MG&A burden. The significant difference between the $352 million stock-based portion and the $2,352 million total underscores the importance of understanding the composition of reported expenses when analyzing AMD's financial statements.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm's involvement with the Non-Arriver businesses includes a funding commitment of approximately $300 million, of which $150 million remained available at the end of fiscal 2022. Despite not owning or operating these businesses, Qualcomm consolidates them as the primary beneficiary under FASB ASC 810 due to its involvement in the transaction design and financial guarantees. The company expects SSW Partners to complete the sale of these businesses within fiscal 2023, subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions. This reflects a strategic structure where Qualcomm assumes financial exposure and reporting responsibility for businesses it does not directly control or retain long-term.",

          "chunk_text": "Seasonality. Many of our products and much of our intellectual property are incorporated into consumer wireless devices, which are subject to seasonality and other fluctuations in demand. Our revenues have historically fluctuated based on consumer demand for devices, as well as on the timing of customer/licensee device launches and/or innovation cycles (such as the transition to the next generation of wireless technologies). This has resulted in fluctuations in QCT revenues in advance of and during device launches incorporating our products and in QTL revenues when licensees' sales occur. These trends may or may not continue in the future. Further, the trends for QTL have been, and may in the future be, impacted by disputes and/or resolutions with licensees and/or governmental investigations or proceedings.\n\n## Fiscal 2022 Overview and Other Recent Events\n\nRevenues were $44.2 billion, an increase of 32% compared to revenues of $33.6 billion in fiscal 2021, with net income of $12.9 billion, an increase of 43% compared to net income of $9.0 billion in fiscal 2021. Highlights from fiscal 2022 and other recent events included:\n\n- QCT revenues increased by 39% in fiscal 2022 compared to the prior year, primarily due to an increase in average selling prices and favorable mix toward higher-tier 5G products along with higher integrated circuit shipments in handsets, as well as higher IoT revenues.\n- On June 15, 2022, the General Court of the European Union issued a ruling annulling in its entirety the European Commission's (EC) 2018 decision, which previously imposed a fine of 997 million euros for which we had provided financial guarantees to satisfy the obligation in lieu of cash payment. As a result, in the third quarter of fiscal 2022, we recorded a $1.1 billion benefit in other income and a $62 million reduction in interest expense resulting from the reversal of the accrued fine and the associated interest previously recorded. See 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.'\n- On October 4, 2021, we and SSW Partners entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Veoneer, Inc. (Veoneer). The transaction closed on April 1, 2022. We funded substantially all of the total cash consideration paid in the transaction, which was approximately $4.7 billion. The operating results of the Non-Arriver businesses are reported as discontinued operations on a one quarter lag. Additional information related to this acquisition is included in this Annual Report in 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 9. Acquisitions.'\n\n## Results of Operations\n\n## Revenues (in millions)\n\n",

Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the Non-Arriver businesses are consolidated and presented as held for sale on our balance sheet, and the operating results are presented as discontinued operations.\n\nOur accounting purchase price was approximately $4.3 billion, substantially all of which relates to our share of cash consideration at close for the outstanding common shares of Veoneer and the Magna termination fee and excludes Veoneer's convertible senior notes that are reflected as an assumed liability. We have finalized the purchase price allocation, except for certain tax matters. Accordingly, the preliminary purchase price allocation shown below could change during the remainder of the measurement period (which will not exceed 12 months from the Closing Date).

Acquisitions\n\nNuvia. On March 16, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Nuvia for $1.1 billion (net of $174 million cash acquired), substantially all of which was paid in cash. In connection with the acquisition, we assumed or replaced unvested Nuvia stock awards with Qualcomm stock awards with an estimated fair value of $258 million, which have post-acquisition requisite service periods of up to four years. At the time of the acquisition, Nuvia had certain in-process technologies and was comprised of a CPU (central processing unit) and technology design team with expertise in high performance processors, SoC and power management for compute-intensive devices and applications. Upon completion of development, Nuvia's technologies are expected to be integrated into certain QCT products. We recorded $885 million of goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes and was allocated to our QCT segment for annual impairment testing purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributable to assembled workforce and certain revenue and cost synergies expected to arise after the acquisition. We also recorded a $247 million in-process research and development intangible asset related to a single project, which is expected to be completed in fiscal 2023 and, upon completion, will be amortized over its useful life, which is expected to be seven years. Our results of operations for fiscal 2021 included the operating results of Nuvia since the acquisition date, the amounts of which were not material.\n\nVeoneer. On October 4, 2021, we and SSW Partners, a New York-based investment partnership, entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Veoneer, Inc. (Veoneer). The transaction closed on April 1, 2022 (the Closing Date). Total cash consideration paid in the transaction was $4.7 billion, consisting of (i) $4.6 billion paid in respect of Veoneer's outstanding capital stock and equity awards and amounts paid to settle Veoneer's convertible senior notes (which were converted at the election of the note holders and settled in cash in the third quarter of fiscal 2022) and (ii) a $110 million termination fee paid to Magna International Inc. (Magna) in the first quarter of fiscal 2022. We funded substantially all of the cash consideration payable in the transaction in exchange for (i) the Arriver business (which SSW transferred to us shortly after the Closing Date) and (ii) the right to receive a majority of the proceeds upon the sale of the Non-Arriver businesses by SSW Partners. We intend to incorporate Arriver's computer vision, drive policy and driver assistance technologies into our Snapdragon automotive platform to deliver an integrated software SoC ADAS platform for automakers and Tier-1 automotive suppliers. SSW Partners retained Veoneer's Tier-1 automotive supplier businesses, primarily consisting of the Active Safety and Restraint Control Systems businesses (the Non-Arriver businesses), which it intends to sell in one or more transactions.\n\nWe have agreed to provide certain funding of approximately $300 million to the Non-Arriver businesses while SSW Partners seeks a buyer(s), of which approximately $150 million of funding remained available to the Non-Arriver businesses at September 25, 2022. Such amounts, along with cash retained in the Non-Arriver business, are expected to be used to fund working and other near-term capital needs, as well as certain costs incurred in connection with the close of the acquisition.\n\nAlthough we do not own or operate the Non-Arriver businesses, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary, within the meaning of the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) accounting guidance related to consolidation (ASC 810), of these businesses under the variable interest model. Factors considered in reaching this conclusion included, among others: (i) our involvement in the design of and our funding of substantially all of the total cash consideration payable in the",

      "answer": "The QCT segment reported $37.7 billion in revenues in fiscal 2022, with financial performance detailed in the consolidated financial statements. This segment's revenue is primarily equipment-based and recognized at a point in time, and it is further disaggregated by industry and application, including mobile, RF front-end, automotive, and IoT. However, the segment faces significant revenue recognition complexity due to customer incentive arrangements, such as rebates and marketing reimbursements, which require substantial estimation and are considered variable consideration. Auditors highlighted these arrangements as a critical audit matter, emphasizing the challenges in ensuring the completeness and accuracy of revenue reductions, which are recorded as reductions to accounts receivable or current liabilities. This creates a multi-dimensional view of the QCT segment, where its reported financial strength must be interpreted in light of both its diverse revenue streams and the operational and audit complexities tied to its incentive-based revenue recognition practices.",

For certain QCT customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether the Company has the intent and contractual right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer.\n\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to revenue recognition of QCT customer incentive arrangements is a critical audit matter are the significant audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence obtained related to the completeness and accuracy of reductions to QCT revenues recognized.\n\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management's review of and accounting for QCT customer incentive arrangements as well as controls relating to management's review over the completeness and accuracy of reductions to revenues in fiscal 2022 and accruals for customer incentive arrangements as of the balance sheet date. These procedures also included, among others, testing the completeness and accuracy of reductions to revenues and accruals for QCT customer incentive arrangements recorded in the consolidated financial statements, and recalculating, on a test basis, reductions to revenues and accruals for QCT customer incentive arrangements based upon customer-specific contractual terms.\n\n## /s/ PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\n\nSan Diego, California November 2, 2022\n\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1985.",

      "answer": "QTL's licensing revenue model plays a strategic role in Qualcomm's growth despite its modest balance sheet expansion. In fiscal 2024, QTL contributed $266 million in higher licensing revenues, which is a key growth driver for the company (page 41). This revenue is recognized over time, primarily from royalties tied to mobile handset sales, providing a recurring and predictable income stream (page 73). Meanwhile, the balance sheet data shows QTL's assets grew only slightly\u2014from $731 million in 2022 to $734 million in 2024\u2014indicating the segment requires minimal capital investment to generate its revenue (page 72).

      "question": "How does Broadcom balance its semiconductor business's reliance on concentrated customers with ongoing supply chain constraints while managing its $23.6 billion in multi-year contracts?",
      "answer": "Broadcom's semiconductor business faces a complex balancing act. On one hand, it has a high degree of customer concentration, with one customer accounting for 20% of net revenue in fiscal year 2022. This level of dependency introduces risk, particularly if demand fluctuates or supply constraints persist. On the other hand, Broadcom is navigating ongoing supply chain issues, including limited availability of wafers and substrates, which constrain its ability to meet demand and maintain consistent delivery schedules. Despite these challenges, the company has secured $23.6 billion in remaining performance obligations from multi-year contracts in the semiconductor segment, with 28% expected to convert to revenue within the next 12 months. This suggests Broadcom is leveraging long-term commitments to stabilize revenue, even as it manages near-term volatility in both supply and customer demand.",

We continue to experience various constraints in our supply chain, including with respect to wafers and substrates. Although supply lead times have stabilized, we continue to have difficulties in obtaining some necessary components and inputs in a timely manner to meet demand.\n\nIn response to the pandemic, we have taken extensive measures to protect the health and safety of our employees and contractors at our facilities. We continue to monitor the implications of the pandemic on our operations and may modify our business practices and policies from time to time.\n\nOur ability to predict the impact of the pandemic on our business remains limited and its effects on our business are unlikely to be fully realized, or reflected in our financial results, until future periods.\n\n## Fiscal Year Highlights\n\nHighlights during fiscal year 2022 include the following:\n\n- We generated $16,736 million of cash from operations.\n- We paid $7,032 million in cash dividends.\n- We repurchased $7,000 million of common stock.\n\n## Pending Acquisition of VMware, Inc.\n\nOn May 26, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the 'VMware Merger Agreement') to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, Inc. ('VMware') in a cash-and-stock transaction (the 'VMware Merger') that values VMware at approximately $61 billion, based on the closing price of Broadcom common stock on May 25, 2022. We will also assume VMware's closing date outstanding debt, net of expected cash.\n\nUnder the terms of the VMware Merger Agreement, each share of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger will be indirectly converted into the right to receive, at the election of the holder of such share of VMware common stock, either $142.50 in cash, without interest, or 0.2520 shares of Broadcom common stock. The stockholder election will be subject to proration, such that the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive cash and the total number of shares of VMware common stock entitled to receive Broadcom common stock, will, in each case, be equal to 50% of the aggregate number of shares of VMware common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the VMware Merger.\n\nWe will assume all outstanding VMware restricted stock unit ('RSU') awards and performance stock unit awards held by continuing employees. The assumed awards will be converted into RSU awards for shares of Broadcom common stock. All outstanding in-the-money VMware stock options and RSU awards held by non-employee directors will be accelerated and converted into the right to receive cash and shares of Broadcom common stock, in equal parts.\n\nEffective upon the effective time of the VMware Merger, one member of the VMware Board of Directors, to be mutually agreed by us and VMware, will be added to our Board of Directors.\n\nIn connection with the execution of the VMware Merger Agreement, we entered into a commitment letter on May 26, 2022, with certain financial institutions that committed to provide, subject to the terms and conditions of the commitment letter, a senior unsecured bridge facility in an aggregate principal amount of $32 billion.\n\nThe VMware Merger, which is expected to be completed in our fiscal year ending October 29, 2023 ('fiscal year 2023'), is subject to satisfaction or waiver of customary closing conditions, including the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act of 1976 and clearance under the antitrust laws of the European Union and certain other jurisdictions. On October 3, 2022, we registered approximately 59 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2022, VMware stockholders adopted the VMware Merger Agreement. We and VMware each have termination rights under the VMware Merger Agreement and, under specified circumstances, upon termination of the agreement, we and VMware would be required to pay the other a termination fee of $1.5 billion.\n\n## Net Revenue\n\nA majority of our net revenue is derived from sales of a broad range of semiconductor devices that are incorporated into electronic products, as well as from modules, switches and subsystems. Net revenue is also generated from the sale of software solutions that enable our customers to plan, develop, automate, manage, and secure applications across mainframe, distributed, mobile, and cloud platforms.\n\nOur overall net revenue, as well as the percentage of total net revenue generated by sales in our semiconductor solutions and infrastructure software segments, have varied from quarter to quarter, due largely to fluctuations in end-",

Remaining performance obligations include unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized as revenue in future periods, but do not include contracts for software, subscriptions or services where the customer is not committed. The customer is not considered committed when termination for convenience without payment of a substantive penalty exists, either contractually or through customary business practice. The majority of our customer software contracts include termination for convenience clauses without a substantive penalty and are not considered committed. Additionally, as a practical expedient, we have not included contracts that have an original duration of one year or less, nor have we included contracts with sales-based or usagebased royalties promised in exchange for a license of IP.\n\nCertain multi-year customer contracts in our semiconductor solutions segment contain firmly committed amounts and the remaining performance obligations under these contracts as of October 30, 2022 were approximately $23.6 billion. We expect approximately 28% of this amount to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. Although the majority of our software contracts are not deemed to be committed, our customers generally do not exercise their termination for convenience rights. In addition, the majority of our contracts for products, subscriptions and services have a duration of one year or less.

While its revenue growth was modest (4%) compared to the 37% growth in Semiconductor Solutions, its operating margin (70.7%) far exceeded the semiconductor segment\u2019s 58.4%.
