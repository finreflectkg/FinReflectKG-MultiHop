      "question": "How does the decline in gross profit contribution from the Analog segment in 2023 compared to 2022 align with the company's goodwill allocation to the same segment as disclosed in the balance sheet?",
      "answer": "The gross profit from the Analog segment declined from $10,749 million in 2022 to $8,425 million in 2023, a decrease of $2,324 million. Despite this drop, the Analog segment still holds a significant portion of the company's goodwill at $4,158 million, which is much higher than the goodwill allocated to Embedded Processing ($172 million) and Other ($32 million). This suggests that although the profitability of the Analog segment has decreased, the company continues to attribute substantial long-term value and strategic importance to it, as reflected in the goodwill allocation.",

      "answer": "The litigation risks described on page 34 indicate that disputes involving Qualcomm or third-party patents could lead to a reduction in licensee sales, which would directly impact licensing revenues. Since the QTL segment's revenues are primarily derived from royalties generated through licensees' sales of mobile handsets, as stated on page 73, the concentration of QTL's revenue model in this specific market segment amplifies Qualcomm's exposure to these litigation-related risks. A decline in mobile handset sales due to legal disruptions would have a direct and significant adverse effect on QTL's revenue stream, more so than if the licensing model were diversified across multiple industries or revenue sources.",

          "chunk_text": "In any potential dispute involving us and another company's patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product release or shipment delays and/or damage to our customer relationships, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers' devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.\n\n## Our use of open source software may harm our business.\n\nCertain of our software and our suppliers' software may contain or may be derived from 'open source' software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products' source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such open source software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers, or to license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing programs depend, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\n\n## GENERAL RISK FACTORS\n\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments or reserves, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. During such downturns, our revenues have declined, and our results of operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted. We expect our business to continue to be subject to such cyclical downturns.\n\nA decline in global, regional or local economic conditions, or a slow-down in economic growth, particularly in geographic regions with high concentrations of wireless voice and data users or high concentrations of our customers or licensees, could also have adverse, wide-ranging effects on our business and financial results, including: a decrease in demand for our products and technologies; a decrease in demand for the products and services of our customers or licensees; the inability of our suppliers to deliver on their supply commitments to us, our inability to supply our products to our customers and/or the inability of our customers or licensees to supply their products to end users; the insolvency of key suppliers, customers or licensees; delays in reporting or payments from our customers or licensees; failures by counterparties; and/or negative effects on wireless device inventories. In addition, our customers' and licensees' ability to purchase or pay for our products and intellectual property and network operators' ability to upgrade their wireless networks could be",

      "question": "How does the inclusion of the $1.4 billion acquisition termination cost in the 'All Other' category impact the interpretation of NVIDIA's segment-based operating performance and cost allocation strategy?",
      "answer": "The 'All Other' category, as outlined in the Segment Information section, includes non-recurring expenses such as acquisition termination costs, which are not directly attributed to either the Compute & Networking or Graphics segments. The $1.4 billion acquisition termination cost related to the Arm transaction, disclosed separately in the operating expenses section, is one such expense that falls under this category. Because these costs are not allocated to specific business segments and are instead treated as enterprise-level expenses, they highlight a divergence in how NVIDIA evaluates segment performance versus its overall financial health. This distinction suggests that major strategic costs are intentionally separated from segment-level results to maintain clarity in assessing core operational performance.",

This relationship suggests that the EMEA segment, with a $9.1 billion asset base as of July 29, 2023, benefits from operational leverage through higher-margin service offerings.

      "answer": "The Other segment, which includes DLP products, calculators, and custom ASICs, generated $1.11 billion in revenue in 2023. However, this segment also incorporates non-operational corporate-level expenses such as litigation costs, which are not used in evaluating segment results or allocating resources. This raises questions about the true profitability and operational efficiency of the Other segment, as litigation expenses and similar items could significantly impact its financial performance without being directly tied to its core business activities.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: TXN(page_30) \u2192 Other Segment: The Other segment includes DLP products, calculators, and custom ASICs, and is described as containing operating segments that do not meet the thresholds for separate reporting. It also includes corporate-level expenses such as litigation costs.",
        "Hop 2: Other Segment \u2192 Litigation Expenses: Litigation expenses are specifically listed as one of the corporate-level items included in the Other segment, which are excluded from performance evaluation and resource allocation decisions.",
        "Hop 3: Litigation Expenses \u2190 TXN(page_4): On page 4, litigation expenses are again referenced as part of the Other segment, reinforcing that these are non-operational costs that are not used in assessing the segment's results, despite being included in its financial reporting."

      "question": "Given that EMEA revenues were flat in local currency during fiscal 2024 due to growth in Public Service offsetting declines in other sectors, how does ACN's strategic positioning of Public Service as a key industry group with global reach align with its geographic revenue performance in EMEA?",
      "answer": "ACN reported flat EMEA revenues in local currency for fiscal 2024, citing growth in the Public Service sector as a key driver, despite declines in Communications & Media and Banking & Capital Markets (Page 45). Public Service is highlighted as a core component of the Health & Public Service industry group, which generated $13.8B in FY24 revenues and represents a significant portion of ACN\u2019s global operations (Page 10). This suggests that ACN's strategic emphasis on Public Service, including defense, education, and public safety clients, plays a stabilizing role in regions like EMEA where other sectors are underperforming. The alignment indicates that ACN's industry-specific expertise in Public Service contributes to geographic resilience, even in markets with overall stagnant growth.",

      "answer": "The Embedded Processing segment saw its allocated SG&A expenses increase from $372 million in 2022 to $410 million in 2023, reflecting a growing investment in administrative and sales functions for this business unit. Despite this increasing cost allocation and operational emphasis, the segment's associated goodwill balance remains low at only $172 million as of the latest balance sheet, compared to $4,158 million for Analog. This suggests that while Embedded Processing is incurring higher operating costs, it represents a smaller strategic acquisition-based investment for TXN, potentially indicating a more internally developed or less capitalized segment relative to Analog.",

      "answer": "The $258 million of acquisition-related and other costs in the All Other category for 2023 is a component of the broader set of unallocated expenses that are not attributed to AMD's reportable segments. These unallocated expenses, which also include $2.8 billion of amortization of acquisition-related intangibles and $1.4 billion of stock-based compensation expense, are excluded from segment performance evaluation by the CODM.

This aligns with the $266 million increase in licensing revenues from $5,306 million to $5,572 million during the same period.

      "answer": "The 2% revenue growth in North America was primarily driven by growth in the Public Service and Industrial sectors in the United States, despite declines in the Communications & Media, Banking & Capital Markets, and Software & Platforms segments. The Communications & Media segment, which makes up 40% of the $10.8B FY24 revenue from the Communications, Media & Technology group, experienced a decline that contributed to the muted overall North American growth. This indicates that while Communications & Media is a significant portion of the company's revenue, its underperformance was offset by growth in other sectors, such as Public Service, suggesting a diversified revenue base that can sustain modest regional growth even when a major segment contracts.",

      "answer": "Despite being allocated only $172 million in goodwill, the Embedded Processing segment contributed $1,008 million to TXN's operating profit in 2023, down from $1,253 million in 2022. This indicates a decline in its operating profit year-over-year by $245 million, or about 19.5%. However, given its minimal goodwill allocation compared to its profit generation, the segment demonstrates high financial efficiency.

      "question": "How does AMD's decision to exclude $4.2 billion in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles from the operating income of Xilinx under the Embedded and Data Center segments impact the financial visibility and strategic evaluation of the 'All Other' category, which explicitly includes such amortization costs as a non-allocated expense?",
      "answer": "AMD's 2022 operating income for Xilinx, reported under the Embedded and Data Center segments, excludes $4.2 billion in amortization of acquisition-related intangibles, employee stock-based compensation, and acquisition-related costs, which are instead recorded under the 'All Other' category. This category, although not a reportable segment, captures significant post-acquisition expenses such as amortization of intangibles, restructuring charges, and licensing gains. The exclusion of these costs from the operating segments suggests a strategic intent to present segment performance without the financial burden of past acquisitions. However, the concentration of these costs in the 'All Other' category raises questions about its financial impact and whether it distorts the overall profitability and strategic importance of managing acquisition integration and amortization expenses outside the core segment reporting framework.",

This aligns with the 24% year-over-year growth in subscription revenue reported in the financial tables, which is attributed to increases in net new subscriptions for Creative Cloud and new user acquisition in Document Cloud (as noted on page 46).

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Subscription, Product and Services Offerings\n\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloudhosted  offerings,  term-based,  royalty,  and  perpetual  software  licenses,  associated  software  maintenance  and  support  plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights,  or  options  to  either  renew  monthly  on-premise  term-based  licenses  or  use  committed  funds  to  purchase  other  Adobe products or services.\n\nFully  hosted  subscription  services  (SaaS)  allow  customers  to  access  hosted  software  during  the  contractual  term  without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\n\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically  accounted  for  utilizing  the  'as-invoiced'  practical  expedient.  Revenue  for  subscriptions  sold  as  a  fee  per  period  is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\n\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\n\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent  stand-ready  performance  obligations.  Revenue  from  these  subscription  support  plans  is  recognized  ratably  over  their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\n\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all  other  revenue  recognition  criteria  are  met,  and  classified  as  product  revenue  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income. Revenue  from  on-premise  term  license  or  term  licensing  arrangements  with  unilateral  cancellation  rights  or  monthly  renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\n\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis.

      "answer": "The EMEA segment's gross margin increased in fiscal year 2023, partly due to higher services gross margin, which reflects improved services performance as a positive contributor to regional profitability. This aligns with the company's broader discussion on page 43 where services gross margin improved by 1.7 percentage points, driven by higher sales volume and lower delivery costs. However, the company also notes that supply chain constraints have led to increased exposure, including potential excess and obsolete inventory charges, which have negatively impacted product gross margin and could do so in the future. While the EMEA segment benefited from services performance, the company remains cautious about systemic risks in its supply chain that could offset such gains, particularly in product margins.",

      "question": "How does NVIDIA's decision to exclude acquisition-related intangible amortization expense from segment performance assessments affect the reported profitability trends of the Compute & Networking segment, given its significant growth in depreciation and amortization expenses over the past three fiscal years?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA explicitly states that acquisition-related intangible amortization expense is not allocated to the Compute & Networking or Graphics segments for performance evaluation, and instead is grouped under 'All Other'. This exclusion means that the Compute & Networking segment's operating income appears higher than it would if such expenses were allocated. However, the Compute & Networking segment already bears a growing depreciation and amortization expense, which increased from $377 million in fiscal 2023 to $732 million in fiscal 2025. This rising cost base, separate from the excluded acquisition amortization, may indicate increasing capital intensity or integration costs from prior acquisitions. Therefore, while the segment's reported profitability may look strong, the exclusion of acquisition amortization and the internalization of rising depreciation could mask underlying cost pressures tied to NVIDIA's strategic investments in AI, data center, and automotive platforms.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [NVDA](page_79) \u2192 [Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expense]: NVIDIA discloses that this expense is not allocated to either the Compute & Networking or Graphics segments and is instead included in 'All Other'.",
        "Hop 2: [Acquisition-Related Intangible Amortization Expense] \u2192 [Compute & Networking]: The Compute & Networking segment is not directly burdened by this cost in performance assessments, which could inflate its apparent profitability.",
        "Hop 3: [Compute & Networking] \u2190 [NVDA](page_78): The Compute & Networking segment includes high-growth areas like AI and data center platforms and has seen its own depreciation and amortization expense nearly double in two years, indicating significant capital investment and potential integration costs."

Operating results by segment include costs or expenses directly attributable to each segment, and costs or expenses that are leveraged across our unified architecture and therefore allocated between our two segments. Our CODM  reviews expenses on a consolidated basis, and expenses attributable to each segment are not regularly provided to our CODM .\n\nThe Compute &amp; Networking segment includes our Data Center accelerated computing platforms and AI solutions and software; networking; automotive platforms and autonomous and electric vehicle solutions; Jetson for robotics and other embedded platforms; and DGX  Cloud computing services.\n\nThe Graphics segment includes GeForce GPUs for gaming and PCs, the GeForce NOW game streaming service and related infrastructure, and solutions for gaming platforms;  Quadro/NVIDIA   RTX   GPUs for enterprise workstation graphics; vGPU software for cloud-based visual and virtual computing; automotive platforms for infotainment systems; and Omniverse Enterprise software for building and operating industrial A I and digital twin applications.\n\nThe 'A ll Other' category includes the expenses that are not allocated to either Compute &amp; Networking or Graphics for purposes of making operating decisions or assessing financial performance. The expenses include stock-based compensation expense, corporate infrastructure and support costs, acquisition-related and other costs, and other non-recurring charges and benefits that our CODM  deems to be enterprise in nature.\n\nOur CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on a reportable segment basis.

These charges, which are explicitly excluded from the evaluation and resource allocation for the Analog and Embedded Processing segments, are instead included in the Other segment's financial results. This means that while the Other segment appears to contribute significantly to revenue, part of its financial performance is influenced by one-time or non-recurring costs that do not reflect ongoing operational efficiency. As a result, stakeholders must carefully distinguish between the recurring revenue from DLP and ASIC products versus the impact of these acquisition-related charges when assessing the true contribution of the Other segment to TXN's overall performance.",

      "answer": "Accenture's Banking & Capital Markets segment contributed $11.6B in FY24 revenue, representing a significant portion of the company's Financial Services group. However, in the EMEA region, this segment experienced a decline, which was cited as a key offsetting factor to growth in Public Service. As a result, EMEA revenues remained flat in local currency terms. This contrast highlights that despite Accenture's strategic emphasis and revenue concentration in Banking & Capital Markets, this segment underperformed in EMEA, directly constraining the region\u2019s overall growth potential. The decline in this high-revenue segment within a key geographic market underscores a regional challenge in a core industry group.",

      "question": "How does Intel's increased reliance on partner contributions in 2024 relate to the growth in non-controlling interests for Arizona SCIP, and what does this imply about the role of external stakeholders in Intel's U.S.-based semiconductor manufacturing expansion?",
      "answer": "Intel's 2024 financing activities show a strategic increase in SCIP partner contributions, which directly correlates with the $1,511 million in partner contributions attributed to Arizona SCIP in 2024. This led to a significant rise in Arizona SCIP\u2019s non-controlling interests from $874 million in 2022 to $2,359 million by the end of 2023. Given that Arizona SCIP maintains a 49% non-controlling ownership stake throughout the period, the increase indicates Intel is leveraging external capital to fund its U.S. semiconductor manufacturing initiatives, particularly in Arizona. This suggests a growing role of external stakeholders in Intel\u2019s strategic manufacturing infrastructure, aligning with broader industry trends of public-private partnerships in semiconductor development.",

Our investing capital expenditures were $23.9 billion in 2024 ($25.8 billion in 2023 and $24.8 billion in 2022).\n\nThe decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower purchases of short-term investments, lower capital expenditures, higher proceeds from capital-related government incentives, and higher sales of equity investments. These 2024 cash favorable activities were partially  offset by  lower maturities and sales of short-term inv estments and higher 2024 cash used in other investing activities.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives, including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms, and payment of dividends to stockholders.\n\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions, reduced dividend payments, and other cash favorable financing activities in 2024. These 2024 cash favorable financing activities were partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances, net of repayments; the absence of proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares; and higher financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms in 2024.",

      "answer": "At the end of fiscal year 2022, Cisco reported $313 million in total lease receivables, which includes sales-type leases, out of $7,964 million in total financing receivables. This represents approximately 3.93% of total financing receivables. The company utilizes sales-type leases as part of its broader financing receivables portfolio to facilitate the sale of Cisco and complementary third-party products, with these leases typically collateralized and averaging four-year terms. Compared to loan receivables, which totaled $2,233 million, and financed service contracts, which reached $1,096 million, leasing plays a smaller but still significant role in Cisco's financing strategy, indicating a more pronounced reliance on direct loans and service financing for customer acquisition and retention.",

      "answer": "The significant year-over-year decline in EBT (-$1,195 million) appears to be largely driven by the QSI segment, which saw a dramatic drop from $916 million in EBT in 2021 to a loss of $279 million in 2022. In contrast, the QTL segment, which is described as a licensing business with stable revenue characteristics, maintained a relatively flat EBT contribution (from $4,627 million to $4,628 million). This suggests that the overall EBT decline was not due to QTL\u2019s performance but rather due to other segments, particularly QSI. The strategic importance of QTL as a stable profit center is reinforced by its role in funding Qualcomm\u2019s broader R&D and operational initiatives.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, certain share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development expenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. Our CODM does not evaluate our operating segments using discrete asset information.",

      "answer": "The $2.8 billion amortization of acquisition-related intangibles in 2023 is a major component of the 'All Other' category's $4.4 billion operating loss. This category is specifically used to capture expenses and credits that are not allocated to any of AMD\u2019s reportable segments\u2014Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded\u2014because the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM) does not consider these items when evaluating segment performance. The explicit exclusion of amortization from segment-level reporting underscores how acquisition-related costs are treated as strategic, non-operational expenses that reflect past M&A activity (such as the Xilinx acquisition) rather than ongoing business performance. This creates a contrast between the segment-based view of profitability and the full GAAP view, which includes these non-allocable charges.",

      "answer": "The Graphics segment's operating income is assessed by the CODM based on segment-specific revenue and operating income, excluding enterprise-level expenses such as acquisition-related intangible amortization. However, the Graphics segment still incurs significant depreciation and amortization costs\u2014$372 million, $307 million, and $315 million in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively\u2014which are directly attributed to the segment. Meanwhile, acquisition-related intangible amortization, though a real financial cost, is not allocated to Graphics or Compute & Networking and is instead included in the 'All Other' category. This exclusion means that the Graphics segment's reported operating income may appear more favorable than it would if all amortization costs were included, potentially masking the full financial impact of past acquisitions on the segment's profitability.",

      "question": "How does Intel's increasing financial exposure to Arizona SCIP through non-controlling interest changes reconcile with the operational risks and capital commitments disclosed in the consolidated VIE discussion?",
      "answer": "Intel's non-controlling interest in Arizona SCIP increased significantly from $2,359 million as of December 30, 2023, to $3,888 million as of December 28, 2024, driven by partner contributions and changes in equity (page 74). This growing financial exposure is juxtaposed with the detailed operational risks outlined in the Arizona SCIP section (page 75), including Intel's obligation to operate at minimum production levels and avoid excess inventory, or face damages. Additionally, Intel has an unrecognized commitment to fund its share of Arizona SCIP\u2019s construction costs, which were estimated at $29.0 billion when the agreement was signed in 2022. The increase in non-controlling interest value suggests growing external investment and Intel's deepening financial entanglement, even as the company faces operational constraints and potential penalties tied to performance metrics. This synthesis reveals a strategic bet on Arizona-based manufacturing capacity, balanced against rising financial obligations and operational inflexibility.",

          "chunk_text": "## Semiconductor Co-Investment Program\n\n## Ireland SCIP\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, we closed a transaction with A pollo Global M anagement, Inc. (A pollo) involving the sale of 49% of our interest in an Irish limited liability  company (Ireland SCIP) for net proceeds of $11.0 billion, which increased our capital in excess of par value. Ireland SCIP is a V IE that we consolidate into our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, distributions will be received from Ireland SCIP based on both parties' proportional ownership. Ireland SCIP has the rights to operate Fab 34 in Leixlip, Ireland, and has the rights to the related factory output. We have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP. We will retain sole ownership of Fab 34, will be engaged as the Fab 34 operator in exchange for variable payments from Ireland SCIP based on the related factory output, and will be required to maintain certain performance standards in our capacity as operator.\n\nWe are required to substantially complete construction of Fab 34 in accordance with contractual parameters and timelines or we will be required to pay delayrelated liquidated damages to A pollo beginning in 2026, not to exceed $1.1 billion in total. A s of December 28, 2024, we expect certain construction milestones for Fab 34 will be delayed as we refined our near-term production capacity requirements and related capital outlays relative to those that are required per the Ireland SCIP agreement. As a result, in 2024 we recognized a loss of $755 million within Interest and other, net from the change in fair value of the liquidated damage provisions, which qualify as a non-designated derivative. Refer to \"Note 16: Derivative Financial Instruments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Though we expect certain construction delays in the near term, we intend to complete construction of Fab 34. We will be required to purchase minimum quantities of the related factory output from Ireland SCIP, or we will be subject to pay certain volume-related damages to Ireland SCIP, beginning at the earlier of when construction is complete or Q3 2027.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, other than cash and cash equivalents held by Ireland SCIP, substantially all of the remaining assets and liabilities of Ireland SCIP were eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\n## Arizona SCIP\n\nWe consolidate the results of an A rizona limited liability company (A rizona SCIP), a V IE, into our Consolidated Financial Statements because we are the primary beneficiary. Generally, contributions will be made to, and distributions will be received from A rizona SCIP based on Intel's and Brookfield A sset M anagement's (Brookfield's) proportional ownership. We will be the sole operator and main beneficiary of two new chip factories that will be constructed by A rizona SCIP, and we will have the right to purchase 100% of the related factory output. Once production commences, we will be required to both operate A rizona SCIP at minimum production levels (measured in wafer starts per week) and limit excess inventory held on site or we will be subject to certain damages.\n\nWe have an unrecognized commitment to fund our respective share of the total construction costs of A rizona SCIP. The total construction costs were estimated at $29.0 billion when we entered into the definitive agreement with Brookfield in 2022.\n\nAs of December 28, 2024, substantially all of the assets of A rizona SCIP consisted of property, plant, and equipment. The remaining assets and liabilities of Arizona SCIP were eliminated in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The assets held by A rizona SCIP, which can be used only to settle obligations of the V IE and are not available to us, were $11.5 billion as of December 28, 2024 ($4.8 billion as of December 30, 2023).\n\n## Mobileye\n\nIn 2022, M obileye completed its IPO and certain other equity financing transactions. During 2023, we converted 38.5 million of our M obileye Class B shares into Class A shares, representing 5% of M obileye's outstanding capital stock, and subsequently sold the Class A  shares for $42 per share as part of a secondary offering, receiving net proceeds of $1.6 billion and increasing our capital in excess of par value by $663 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of M obileye into our Consolidated Financial Statements. In the third quarter of 2024, the non-cash impairment of goodwill related to our M obileye reporting unit was attributed to Intel and to non-controlling interest holders based on our proportional ownership (see \"Note 11: Goodwill\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\n\n## IMS Nanofabrication\n\nIn 2023, we closed agreements to sell a combined 32% minority stake in our IM S business, a business within our Intel Foundry operating segment-including a 20% stake to Bain Capital Special Situations and a 10% stake to TSM C. Net proceeds resulting from the minority stake sales totaled $1.4 billion, and our capital in excess of par value increased by $958 million, net of tax. We continue to consolidate the results of IM S into our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n73",

      "answer": "The decline in TXN's overall operating profit from $7,331 million in 2023 to $5,465 million in 2024 reflects a significant drop of $1,866 million. This decline can be partially attributed to the relatively modest contribution from the 'Other' segment, which reported an operating profit of $505 million in 2024. While the 'Other' segment was profitable, its contribution was not sufficient to offset the broader decline in operating profit across the company, particularly from the dominant Analog segment ($4,608 million) and Embedded Processing segment ($352 million). Thus, the overall profitability contraction appears to be driven by broader segment-level challenges, despite the 'Other' segment maintaining positive operating results.",

      "answer": "Oracle's 2022 financial performance was negatively impacted by a $(86) million loss in 'Other (losses) gains,' a significant decline from the $211 million gain in 2021. This shift alone contributed to a $297 million deterioration in total non-operating income. When combined with other factors such as a $147 million loss in equity investments (compared to a $262 million gain in 2021), the total non-operating income swung from a $282 million gain in 2021 to a $(522) million loss in 2022.

      "answer": "The Embedded Processing Segment contributed $1,315 million to the overall cost of revenue of $6,547 million in 2024, which represents approximately 20.1% of the total cost of revenue. Despite this, the segment only generated $1,218 million in gross profit, which is just 13.4% of the company's total gross profit of $9,094 million. This indicates that while the segment accounts for a significant portion of the company's cost base, its contribution to profitability is relatively smaller, suggesting lower margins compared to other segments like Analog. This disparity highlights the segment's operational inefficiency or lower pricing power relative to its cost burden.",

      "answer": "The Analog segment's operating profit declined by $2,538 million (from $8,359 million in 2022 to $5,821 million in 2023), signaling a significant drop in profitability. This decline occurs alongside a substantial goodwill balance of $4,158 million attributed to the same segment as of 2023. Given that goodwill impairment testing is triggered when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, and declining profitability can indicate reduced future cash flows, this disparity raises concerns about whether the Analog segment's goodwill may be at risk of impairment. The magnitude of the goodwill balance relative to the recent drop in operating profit suggests a potentially precarious financial exposure, requiring closer scrutiny of impairment testing assumptions and long-term strategic alignment.",

      "question": "How does the proportion of cost of revenue attributed to the Analog segment in 2023 relate to the goodwill allocated to that same segment, compared to other business units?",
      "answer": "The Analog segment accounted for $4,615 million (or approximately 71%) of the total $6,500 million cost of revenue in 2023, indicating its significant operational scale. This aligns with the $4,158 million in goodwill allocated to the Analog segment, which represents the majority of the company\u2019s total $4,362 million in goodwill. In contrast, smaller segments like Embedded Processing have much lower cost of revenue ($1,493 million) and correspondingly lower goodwill ($172 million). This suggests that the Analog segment is not only a dominant contributor to cost of revenue but also carries the highest intangible asset value, reflecting its strategic importance and acquisition history.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [TXN](page_31) \u2192 [Cost of revenue]: The company discloses segment-level cost of revenue, showing Analog's share at $4,615 million out of $6,500 million total in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: [Cost of revenue] \u2192 [Analog]: Analog is a major contributor to cost of revenue, indicating its substantial role in operations.",
        "Hop 3: [Analog] \u2190 [TXN](page_52): The company reports $4,158 million in goodwill allocated to the Analog segment, which is the largest portion of the company's total $4,362 million in goodwill."

      "question": "Given Embedded Processing's gross profit of $1,875 million and its relatively low goodwill allocation of $172 million, how does this disparity reflect on Texas Instruments' capital efficiency expectations and strategic prioritization of this segment?",
      "answer": "The Embedded Processing segment generated a gross profit of $1,875 million in 2023, yet was allocated only $172 million in goodwill, significantly lower than Analog's $4,158 million. This suggests Texas Instruments may view Embedded Processing as less strategically central or less capital-intensive compared to Analog, where higher goodwill aligns with stronger profitability. The low goodwill relative to gross profit may indicate management expects this segment to be more capital-efficient or anticipates lower long-term value capture relative to current earnings, influencing resource allocation and investment decisions.",

Within FY24, the Communications & Media sub-sector accounted for 40% of CMT\u2019s revenue, or approximately $4.33 billion.

      "answer": "Adobe reported a 24% year-over-year increase in subscription revenue, driven by growth in Creative and Document Cloud offerings (page 46). This growth is reflected in the financial metrics showing an increase from $1,108 million in 2020 to $1,374 million in 2021 (page 47). However, the accounting policy on page 63 clarifies that these cloud-enabled offerings are treated as a single performance obligation, with revenue recognized ratably over the subscription period rather than upfront. This ratable recognition method aligns with the sustained growth pattern and explains how Adobe can report consistent subscription revenue growth over time despite potentially large upfront customer commitments.",

Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\n\n## Subscription, Product and Services Offerings\n\nWe enter into revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of cloud-enabled subscriptions, cloudhosted  offerings,  term-based,  royalty,  and  perpetual  software  licenses,  associated  software  maintenance  and  support  plans, consulting services, training and technical support. Certain revenue arrangements provide customers with unilateral cancellation rights,  or  options  to  either  renew  monthly  on-premise  term-based  licenses  or  use  committed  funds  to  purchase  other  Adobe products or services.\n\nFully  hosted  subscription  services  (SaaS)  allow  customers  to  access  hosted  software  during  the  contractual  term  without taking possession of the software. Cloud-hosted subscription services may be sold on a fee-per-subscription period basis or based on consumption or usage.\n\nWe recognize revenue ratably over the contractual service term for hosted services that are priced based on a committed number of transactions where the delivery and consumption of the benefit of the services occur evenly over time, beginning on the date the services associated with the committed transactions are first made available to the customer and continuing through the end of the contractual service term. Over-usage fees and fees based on the actual number of transactions are billed in accordance with contract terms as these fees are incurred and are included in the transaction price of an arrangement as variable consideration. Fees based on a number of transactions, where invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically  accounted  for  utilizing  the  'as-invoiced'  practical  expedient.  Revenue  for  subscriptions  sold  as  a  fee  per  period  is recognized ratably over the contractual term as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit of the underlying service.\n\nWhen cloud-enabled services are highly integrated and interrelated with on-premise software, such as in our cloud-enabled Creative Cloud and Document Cloud offerings, the individual components are not considered distinct and revenue is recognized ratably over the subscription period for which the cloud-enabled services are provided.\n\nThe subscription support plans related to those customer arrangements whose revenues we classify as subscription revenues represent  stand-ready  performance  obligations.  Revenue  from  these  subscription  support  plans  is  recognized  ratably  over  their respective contractual terms and classified as subscription revenue.\n\nLicenses for on-premise software may be purchased on a perpetual basis, as a subscription for a fixed period of time or based on usage for certain of our OEM and royalty agreements. Revenue from non-cloud enabled on-premise licenses without unilateral cancellation rights or monthly renewal options is recognized at the point in time the software is available to the customer, provided all  other  revenue  recognition  criteria  are  met,  and  classified  as  product  revenue  on  our  Consolidated  Statements  of  Income. Revenue  from  on-premise  term  license  or  term  licensing  arrangements  with  unilateral  cancellation  rights  or  monthly  renewal options, and any associated maintenance and support, is classified as subscription revenue.\n\nOur services and other revenue is comprised primarily of fees related to consulting, training, maintenance and support for certain on-premise licenses that are recognized at a point in time and our advertising offerings. We typically sell our consulting contracts on a time-and-materials and fixed-fee basis. These revenues are recognized as the services are performed for time and materials contracts and on a relative performance basis for fixed-fee contracts. Training revenues are recognized as the services are performed. Our maintenance and support offerings, which entitle customers, partners and developers to receive desktop product upgrades and enhancements or technical support, depending on the offering, are generally recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement.  Our  transaction-based  advertising  offerings,  where  fees  are  based  on  a  number  of  impressions  per  month  and invoicing is aligned to the pattern of performance, customer benefit and consumption, are typically accounted for utilizing the 'asinvoiced' practical expedient.\n\n## Judgments\n\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple goods and services. For example, some of our offerings include both onpremise and/or on-device software licenses and cloud services.

      "answer": "AMD's All Other category includes licensing gains, which are not allocated to reportable segments because the CODM excludes them when evaluating segment performance. Despite this exclusion, licensing gains (or losses) directly impact operating income, with AMD recording negative licensing gains of -$48M in 2024, -$34M in 2023, and -$102M in 2022. This creates a discrepancy between segment-level performance metrics and overall operating income, suggesting that external licensing activities may be masking underlying segment profitability trends. The exclusion implies that AMD's operating income figures are influenced by non-segment items, which could distort year-over-year comparisons and affect how analysts assess the company's core business performance.",

      "answer": "The $947 million revenue figure reported for the Other segment in 2024 includes revenue from DLP products, calculators, and ASICs, but it also incorporates non-operational items such as gains and losses from asset dispositions. These gains and losses are specifically excluded from the evaluation and resource allocation decisions for reportable segments like Analog and Embedded Processing, which are assessed based on revenue growth, gross margin, and operating profit. Since the Other segment aggregates both operational revenue and non-core financial activities (like asset dispositions), the $947 million figure may not fully reflect the ongoing operational performance of the businesses within Other. This raises questions about the comparability of Other\u2019s results to the more strategically managed reportable segments.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

      "answer": "Accenture identifies Public Service as a major industry group generating $13.8B in FY24 revenues, representing 31% of its Health & Public Service group. This sector is highlighted as a key growth driver in the geographic revenue analysis, particularly in North America, where it contributed to a 2% local currency revenue increase. The alignment suggests that Public Service is not only a substantial revenue contributor globally but also a critical component of Accenture\u2019s regional growth strategy, especially in North America, where the U.S. was the primary growth engine. This dual emphasis underscores the strategic importance of Public Service both as an industry vertical and as a regional growth lever.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm's QTL segment is heavily reliant on licensing revenues, which are primarily derived from royalties tied to mobile handset sales by a limited number of licensees, including several Chinese OEMs. This concentration increases business risk because a failure by these key licensees to meet reporting or payment obligations, or a lack of success in their product development and sales efforts, could significantly reduce QTL's revenues. This exposure is compounded by geopolitical and trade-related tensions between the U.S. and China, which could further disrupt these licensing relationships. As a result, the structural dependence of the QTL segment on a narrow set of licensing partners amplifies the risks outlined in the qualitative risk factors, particularly those related to customer concentration and regional economic and political instability.",

Any such reduction in revenues would also impact our cash resources available for other purposes, such as research and development.\n\nFurther, while our product and revenue diversification strategies have resulted in an increasing portion of our revenues coming from outside of mobile handsets, e.g., from industries such as automotive and IoT, certain product categories within those industries may in themselves be subject to high levels of customer concentration.\n\nAlthough we have more than 300 licensees, we derive a significant portion of our licensing revenues from a limited number of licensees, which includes a number of Chinese OEMs. In the event that one or more of our significant licensees fail to meet their reporting and payment obligations, or we are unable to renew or modify one or more of their license agreements under similar terms as their existing agreements, our revenues, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely impacted. Moreover, the future growth and success of our core licensing business will depend in part on the ability of our licensees to develop, introduce and deliver high-volume products that achieve and sustain customer acceptance. We do not have control over the product development, sales efforts or pricing of products by our licensees, and our licensees might not be successful. Reductions in sales of our licensees' products, or reductions in the average selling prices of wireless devices sold by our licensees without a sufficient increase in the volumes of such devices sold, would generally have an adverse effect on our licensing revenues.\n\n## Our business, particularly our semiconductor business, may suffer as a result of our customers vertically integrating (i.e., developing their own integrated circuit products).\n\nCertain of our largest integrated circuit customers (for example, Samsung) develop their own integrated circuit products, which they have in the past utilized, and currently utilize, in certain of their devices and may in the future utilize in some or all of their devices, rather than our products (and they have and may continue to sell their integrated circuit products to third parties, discretely or together with certain of their other products, in competition with us).\n\nApple has utilized modem products of one of our competitors in some of its devices rather than our products, and solely utilized one of our competitors' products in several of its prior device launches. In December 2019, Apple acquired Intel's modem assets and is developing its own modem products using those assets. Accordingly, we expect Apple to use its own modem products, rather than our products, in some or all of its future devices.\n\nSimilarly, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from Chinese OEMs. Certain of our customers in China have developed, and others may in the future develop, their own integrated circuit products and use such integrated circuit products in their devices rather than our integrated circuit products, including due to pressure from or policies of the Chinese government (whose Made in China 2025 campaign targets 70% semiconductor self-sufficiency by 2025), concerns over losing access to our integrated circuit products as a result of actual, threatened or potential U.S. or Chinese government actions or policies, including trade protection or national security policies, or other reasons. See also the Risk Factor titled ' A significant portion of our business is concentrated in China, and the risks of such concentration are exacerbated by U.S./China trade and national security tensions. '\n\nIn addition, periodic supply/capacity constraints within the semiconductor industry may further incentivize our integrated circuit customers to vertically integrate in an effort to secure additional control over their supply chains.\n\nIf some or all of our largest customers and/or the largest smartphone OEMs utilize their own integrated circuit/modem products in some or all of their devices rather than our products, our business, revenues, results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely impacted. See also the Risk Factor titled ' We derive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers and licensees, and particularly from their sale of premium tier devices.

      "answer": "The absence of integration charges in 2023, following $257 million in 2022 and $104 million in 2021, indicates that TXN may have completed or significantly reduced integration activities from prior periods. According to the segment reporting disclosure, integration charges are included in the Other segment and are not used in evaluating the results of or allocating resources to reportable segments. Instead, the company allocates the remainder of corporate expenses, including integration-related costs, to operating segments based on specific methodologies such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount. This suggests that any remaining integration costs in 2023 would have been distributed across the Analog and Embedded Processing segments rather than retained in Other, reflecting a shift in how these costs are managed and reported.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives (QSI) is described in the segment reporting as a vehicle for making strategic investments, which suggests a long-term growth and diversification focus. Despite this strategic intent, the earnings before taxes (EBT) contribution from QSI in 2023 was a loss of $12 million, as disclosed in the financial tables. This contrasts with the broader intent of QSI, indicating that in the short term, the segment may not be contributing positively to profitability and could represent a financial drag.

      "question": "How does the exclusion of IP-related costs from segment performance evaluation impact the interpretation of NVIDIA's gross margin improvement, given the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost in fiscal year 2023?",
      "answer": "NVIDIA's CODM excludes IP-related costs from segment performance evaluation, as these are classified under the 'All Other' category along with other enterprise-level expenses. This means that the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost from fiscal year 2023, which is included in the 'All Other' category, does not directly factor into the operating performance assessment of the Compute & Networking or Graphics segments. However, IP-related costs are included in gross profit calculations, as seen on page 40, where they are explicitly mentioned as part of cost of revenue. This dual treatment creates a divergence in how IP-related expenses influence segment-level decision-making versus overall financial metrics like gross margin. While the gross margin improved significantly in fiscal year 2024 (rising from 56.9% to 72.7%), partly due to strong Data Center revenue, the exclusion of IP-related costs and one-time charges like the Arm termination fee from segment results suggests that the true economic burden of these costs may not be fully reflected in operational performance assessments, potentially masking underlying cost pressures.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: [NVDA](page_78) \u2192 [All Other Category]: The 'All Other' category includes expenses not assigned to either of NVIDIA\u2019s two main segments for performance evaluation, such as IP-related costs and the $1.4 billion Arm acquisition termination cost.",
        "Hop 2: [All Other Category] \u2192 [IP-Related Costs]: IP-related costs are explicitly listed as part of the 'All Other' category, indicating they are not allocated to operating segments and are considered enterprise-level expenses.",
        "Hop 3: [IP-Related Costs] \u2190 [NVDA](page_40): IP-related costs are included in the cost of revenue, directly affecting gross profit and gross margin, even though they are not part of segment-level performance evaluation."

      "answer": "The $379 million increase in Licensing Revenue in fiscal 2024 (from $5,792 million to $6,171 million) directly reflects growth in the QTL segment's performance, which is Qualcomm's dedicated licensing arm. According to the financial summary, this growth was driven in part by $266 million of the total $3.142 billion revenue increase. The QTL segment's revenue model is described on page 73 as being based on licensing fees recognized over time, primarily from royalties tied to mobile handset sales by licensees. This indicates that the Licensing Revenue growth is not only a financial metric but also a strategic performance indicator of Qualcomm's licensing agreements and their sustained market penetration in the mobile industry.",

      "answer": "The Embedded Processing segment shows a pattern of relatively stable R&D investment, with expenditures of $413 million in 2022 and $457 million in 2023, suggesting a focus on organic innovation. However, the segment only carries $172 million in goodwill, indicating limited acquisition activity. In contrast, the Analog segment has a significantly higher goodwill balance of $4,158 million, which implies a much greater reliance on acquisitions as part of its growth strategy.

      "question": "Given the risks to Qualcomm's licensing revenues from regulatory challenges outlined in the risk factors, how does the QTL segment's balance sheet position as of September 24, 2023, reflect the company's exposure to potential disruptions in its high-margin licensing business?",
      "answer": "The risk factors on page 28 highlight that reductions in licensing revenues could have a disproportionate impact on Qualcomm's cash resources due to the higher margin contribution of the licensing business. The QTL segment's balance sheet data from page 72 shows that as of September 24, 2023, the QTL segment held only $733 million in assets, compared to $9,909 million for the QCT segment. This relatively small balance sheet position of the QTL segment suggests limited financial buffer against regulatory or legal challenges that could disrupt licensing revenues. Given the segment's critical role in generating high-margin licensing income and the significant legal risks outlined, the modest asset base indicates Qualcomm may have limited capacity to absorb prolonged revenue disruptions in its licensing business without impacting overall financial stability.",

        "Hop 1: QCOM(page_28) \u2192 Licensing Revenues: Risk factors describe how regulatory challenges could reduce licensing revenues, which would disproportionately impact cash resources due to the high-margin nature of the licensing business.",

        "Hop 3: QTL Segment \u2190 QCOM(page_72): Financial data shows the QTL segment's balance sheet position was only $733 million as of September 24, 2023, significantly smaller than the QCT segment's $9,909 million."

      "answer": "Microsoft's Intelligent Cloud segment revenue increased from $21.563 billion in fiscal 2023 to $23.117 billion in fiscal 2024, reflecting a growth of $1.554 billion or approximately 7.2%. This growth is aligned with the broader Microsoft Cloud revenue, which reached $137.4 billion in fiscal 2024. Since Server Products and Cloud Services are a core component of the Intelligent Cloud segment and also a major contributor to the Microsoft Cloud revenue, the growth in Intelligent Cloud directly supports the overall Microsoft Cloud revenue increase. This indicates that Azure and other cloud services, which are central to both classifications, are driving substantial and consistent growth across both segment and consolidated cloud revenue reporting.",

      "answer": "Oracle's segment margin reporting on page 106 excludes non-operating expenses such as amortization, restructuring, and interest expenses, which are critical to understanding the full cost structure of the business. This exclusion means segment margins appear stronger than the company's actual consolidated profitability. On page 55, Oracle reports a $522 million net non-operating loss for fiscal 2022, a significant deterioration from the $282 million net income in the prior year. This loss includes foreign currency losses of $199 million, losses from equity investments of $147 million, and other losses of $86 million. The contrast between the segment reporting and the consolidated results highlights that while individual business units may appear profitable, the company's overall financial health is materially impacted by non-operating items.

      "question": "What is the significance of the decrease in non-controlling interests related to Mobileye from 2023 to 2024, and how does this trend align with Intel's reported stake in Mobileye as a strategic asset on its balance sheet?",
      "answer": "Intel's non-controlling interests in Mobileye decreased from $1,838 million as of December 30, 2023, to $1,672 million as of December 28, 2024, indicating a reduction in third-party equity participation in Mobileye. This decrease occurred despite a prior increase in non-controlling interests in Mobileye from $989 million in 2022 to $1,838 million in 2023, which was driven by equity changes and partner contributions. Meanwhile, Intel's reported stake in Mobileye remained constant at $10,919 million as of both December 31, 2022, and December 30, 2023, suggesting no acquisition or revaluation activity for its controlling interest during this period. This implies that while Intel maintained its strategic ownership level in Mobileye, the overall capital structure of Mobileye saw a reduction in non-controlling stakes, potentially reflecting buyouts or equity adjustments that Intel did not directly fund or benefit from.",

      "answer": "In 2022, the Analog segment's SG&A expenses were $1,212 million, representing approximately 11.3% of the $10,749 gross profit. By 2023, SG&A expenses rose to $1,287 million, or approximately 15.3% of the $8,425 gross profit, indicating a significant increase in cost pressure relative to profitability. This growing proportion of SG&A costs could reduce the segment's operating efficiency and long-term profitability. Meanwhile, the Analog segment is associated with a goodwill valuation of $4,158, which reflects an expectation of sustained earnings and competitive strength. The increasing SG&A percentage raises questions about whether the segment can maintain the performance needed to support such a high goodwill figure, especially if cost containment becomes a challenge.",

      "answer": "TXN includes acquisition, integration, and restructuring charges in the Other segment, which is not used in evaluating the results of or allocating resources to the company's main operating segments. Despite generating $1.11 billion in revenue in 2023, the Other segment contains non-operational financial items such as acquisition charges, which can distort performance comparisons and resource prioritization between segments. This implies that while the Other segment contributes significantly to revenue, its financial results are not assessed in the same way as the Analog and Embedded Processing segments due to the inclusion of corporate-level charges.",

However, on page 68, the company discloses that the current amount of Purchased Technology assets is $100 million with a weighted average useful life of only 3 years, suggesting accelerated amortization or recent write-downs. This contrasts with the historical cost data on page 75, which shows a net carrying value of $337 million for Purchased Technology in 2023, indicating a significant reduction in net value relative to original cost consistent with mid-life amortization. The discrepancy between the standard 5-year life and the 3-year life shown in current asset disclosures suggests either impairment or strategic changes in asset valuation.",

      "answer": "The company invested $1,317 million in research and development for the Analog segment in 2023, the largest R&D allocation among its business units, signaling a strong strategic focus. This emphasis aligns with the $4,158 million in goodwill allocated to the Analog segment, which represents the majority of the company's total $4,362 million in goodwill. The high R&D spending paired with the substantial goodwill allocation indicates that Analog is not only a key growth driver but also a central component of the company's long-term value and competitive positioning in the semiconductor market.",

This means that while the 'Other' segment contributes financially through its products, it also absorbs corporate-level expenses like environmental costs that are not directly tied to operational performance.

      "answer": "The QSI segment's dramatic improvement from a $12M loss in 2023 to a $104M profit in 2024 suggests a significant strategic shift or success in Qualcomm's investment portfolio management. This turnaround contrasts with the broader decline in 'Equipment and services revenues' which fell from $28B to $18B year-over-year. Given that QSI is described as the segment that 'makes strategic investments' and is evaluated based on EBT alongside other core business units, the profitability jump indicates that the segment is delivering tangible financial value. This improvement supports the strategic rationale for maintaining a dedicated investment arm, especially as other segments face headwinds.",

      "answer": "Intel's NEX segment, which focuses on networking and edge computing solutions, is now operationally dependent on Intel Foundry under the new internal foundry model implemented in Q1 2024. As part of the Intel Products business (which includes CCG, DCAI, and NEX), NEX incurs intersegment charges for manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry. This creates a financial linkage where any cost inefficiencies, production delays, or capacity constraints within Intel Foundry could directly affect NEX's cost structure and profitability. While the internal foundry model aims to improve transparency and efficiency, it also concentrates manufacturing risk within Intel's own operations, potentially increasing financial exposure for NEX compared to using external foundries with diversified supply chains.",

A  discussion regarding our consolidated results of operations for 2023 relative to 2022 is included in our 2023 Form 10-K. \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K reconciles our segment and consolidated results for each of the periods presented.\n\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" w ithin MD&amp;A. 1\n\n## Operating Segment Trends and Results\n\n## Intel Products\n\nIntel Products consists substantially of the design, development, marketing, sale, support, and servicing of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Products is composed of three operating segments: CCG, DCAI, and NEX.\n\n## Client Computing Group\n\n## Market and Business Overview\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are committed to advancing PC experiences by delivering competitive products and deepening our relationships with industry partners to co-engineer and deliver leading platform innovation. We bring together the operating system, system architecture, hardware, and software application integration to enable industry-leading PC experiences. We embrace these opportunities by focusing on our roadmap, delivering innovative PC capabilities, and designing advanced PC experiences. By doing this, we believe we help fuel innovation across the industry, providing a solid source of IP, scale, and cash flow for Intel.\n\n## Market Trends and Strategy\n\nIn 2024, the PC market started to stabilize from a soft macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures, with PC supply and demand levels beginning to normalize. We remain positive on the long-term outlook for PCs, as household density is stable to increasing, educational device penetration rates remain low outside of the US, and PC usage remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic rates . Commercial growth opportunities also remain as corporations expand the size of their PC fleets, while also replacing older devices. Currently, more than 200 million commercial devices are more than four years old . 1 2\n\nWe recently introduced our Intel Core Ultra processor family that serves as the CPU for the A I PC, which enables A I capabilities at the client level. We believe the A I PC is a significant potential driver of PC demand over the coming years, and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend that we expect will support a long-term PC TAM  of 300 million units . 3\n\nWe deliver value to our customers by leveraging our engineering capabilities and working with our partners across an open, innovative ecosystem to deliver technology that drives every major aspect of the computing experience, including performance, power efficiency, battery life, connectivity, graphics, and form factors, to create the most advanced PC platforms. We design our products with a philosophy of openness and choice, and seek to continually provide more competitive products with more capabilities for customers.\n\n## Products and Competition\n\nIn 2023, we introduced a significant update to our client compute brands to make it easier for customers to identify the right client solutions for their compute needs. Those brands include Intel, Intel Core and Intel Core Ultra. The Intel and Intel Core brands have been staples of the PC industry for nearly two decades and represented our highest volume products by unit sales in 2024. These products are designed to serve a broad cross-section of the customer and computing needs in the client market.\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra processor family, which we launched at the end of 2023, delivers significant advancements in graphics, A I, and multi-threaded CPU performance and introduced the AI PC to the market. In the second half of 2024, the next-generation Intel Core Ultra 200V  Series became our highest performance client processors, with increased battery life for mobile PCs. We also introduced the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series processors, catering to the desktop enthusiast market. We remain committed to delivering the most advanced processing power to support the growing demands of AI, graphics, and multithreaded workloads.\n\nWe operate in a particularly competitive market. In processors, we compete with A dvanced M icro Devices, Inc. (A M D) and vendors who design applications processors based on ARM architecture, such as Apple Inc. (A pple) with its M  series products and Qualcomm Inc. (Qualcomm) with its Snapdragon product. We expect this competitive environment to continue to intensify in 2025.\n\nWe remain committed to creating an open ecosystem to foster growth and technology innovations. We embrace and collaborate with a global ecosystem of industry partners to deliver competitive technologies together.\n\n- Source: Intel calculated PC density from industry analyst reports. 1\n- Source: Intel calculated volume of devices over four years old from industry analyst reports and internal data. 2\n- Source: Intel calculated multi-year TAM forecast derived from industry analyst reports. 3\n\nMD&amp;A",

A n estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Note 3 : Operating Segments\n\nWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utiliz e marketing, sales, and other support functions.\n\nOur internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate A ltera as a standalone business. A ltera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" A s a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. A ll prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our operating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.\n\nWe organize our business as follows:\n\n- Intel Products:\n- Client Computing Group (CCG)\n- Data Center and AI (DCAI)\n- Network and Edge (NEX)\n- Intel Foundry\n- All other:\n- Altera\n- Mobileye\n- Other\n\nCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX , A ltera, and M obileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.\n\nThe accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A  summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:\n\n## Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX\n\n- Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.\n- Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n68",

      "answer": "The Analog segment contributed $5,821 to operating profit in 2023, which is significantly lower than its $8,359 contribution in 2022. This decline in operating profit, despite the substantial $4,158 goodwill allocation to the segment, suggests a potential mismatch between the segment's current earnings performance and its asset valuation. This could indicate impairment risk or a need for reassessment of the segment's long-term profitability and strategic alignment with TXN's overall financial objectives.",

      "question": "Given Qualcomm's strategic focus with QSI as a reportable segment and its impact on earnings before taxes (EBT), how does the $31 million in QSI revenues in 2022 align with the $279 million EBT loss from the same segment, and what does this discrepancy suggest about the nature of QSI's strategic investments?",
      "answer": "The $31 million in QSI revenues reported in 2022 indicates limited direct income generation from Qualcomm's Strategic Initiatives segment. However, this contrasts with the $279 million EBT loss from QSI, suggesting that the segment's strategic investments are incurring significant costs or losses not offset by current revenues. This discrepancy highlights that QSI is likely engaged in early-stage, high-risk ventures or long-term strategic bets that are not yet monetizable, aligning with its role as a strategic investment arm rather than a profit center. The segment's negative EBT underscores the financial burden these initiatives place on Qualcomm's overall profitability in the short term.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, certain share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development expenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. Our CODM does not evaluate our operating segments using discrete asset information.",

      "answer": "AMD's 'All Other' category, which is not a reportable segment, includes certain non-operational credits such as licensing gain that are not allocated to any of the core business segments. Specifically, the 2023 10-K notes that the 'All Other' category includes licensing gain among other unallocated items. Separately, the document discloses that in 2023, AMD recognized $102 million in licensing gain from a milestone achievement and royalty income related to the THATIC JV, stemming from a 2016 IP licensing agreement. This indicates that while the licensing gain is a material item in the financials and arises from strategic IP monetization efforts, it is treated as a non-core, one-time credit within the 'All Other' category, rather than being integrated into segment-level performance metrics. Thus, the $102 million gain influences overall operating income but is excluded from the evaluation of segment profitability.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm's QTL segment generates 'substantially all' of its revenue through licensing agreements recognized over time, primarily from royalties tied to mobile handset sales (page 73). However, the financial statements note that these licensing revenues are subject to recognition constraints, including the risk of significant revenue reversals, enforceability disputes, and licensee underreporting (page 69). To manage these risks, Qualcomm applies revenue constraints, recognizing less than contractually owed amounts when necessary to mitigate reversal risk. This indicates a strategic balance\u2014while licensing remains central to QTL\u2019s model, the company proactively adjusts revenue recognition to reflect real-world legal and contractual uncertainties.",

Cash collected from customers prior to a contract existing is recorded to other customer-related liabilities in other current liabilities.\n\nFrom time to time, regulatory authorities investigate our business practices, particularly with respect to our licensing business, and institute proceedings against us. Depending on the matter, various remedies that could result from an unfavorable resolution include, among others, the loss of our ability to enforce one or more of our patents; injunctions; monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money; the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices, such as requiring us to reduce our royalty rates, reduce the base on which our royalties are calculated, grant patent licenses to chipset manufacturers, sell chipsets to unlicensed original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) or modify or renegotiate some or all of our existing license agreements; and determinations that some or all of our license agreements are invalid or unenforceable. Additionally, from time to time, companies initiate various strategies in an attempt to negotiate, renegotiate, reduce and/or eliminate their need to pay royalties to us for the use of our intellectual property, which may include disputing, underreporting, underpaying, not reporting and/or not paying royalties owed to us under their license agreements with us, or reporting to us in a manner that is not in compliance with their contractual obligations. In such cases, we estimate and recognize licensing revenues only when we have a contract, as defined in the revenue recognition guidance, which includes, among other items, evaluating whether our license agreements remain valid and enforceable and evaluating licensees' conduct and whether they remain committed to perform their respective obligations. We also estimate and recognize licensing revenues only to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenues recognized will not occur, which includes, among other items, determining the expected impact, if any, to revenues of any license agreements that may be renegotiated and/or are newly entered into. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal considering both the likelihood and magnitude of the reversal and, if necessary, constrain the amount of estimated revenues recognized in order to mitigate this risk, which may result in recognizing revenues less than amounts contractually owed to us. These aforementioned estimates may require significant judgment.\n\nWe measure revenues (including our estimates of sales-based royalties) based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for products or services. We record reductions to revenues for customer incentive arrangements, including volume-related and other pricing rebates and cost reimbursements for marketing and other activities involving certain of our products and technologies, in the period that the related revenues are earned. For certain QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies) customer incentive arrangements, there is complexity in applying certain contractual terms to determine the amount recorded as a reduction to revenues. For the periods presented, no significant reversals of revenues have been made related to such amounts previously recorded. The amounts accrued for customer incentive arrangements are recorded as a reduction to accounts receivable, net or as other current liabilities based on whether we have the intent and contractual right of offset. Certain amounts recorded as a reduction to revenues for customer incentive arrangements are considered variable consideration and are included in the transaction price primarily based on estimating the most likely amount expected to be provided to the customer/licensee.\n\nAdjustments made to revenues in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available are included in our disclosure of revenues recognized from previously satisfied performance obligations (Note 2).\n\nRevenues recognized from sales of our products and sales-based royalties are generally included in accounts receivable, net (including unbilled receivables) based on our unconditional right to payment for satisfied or partially satisfied performance obligations.\n\nConcentrations. A significant portion of our revenues are concentrated with a small number of customers/licensees of our QCT and QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing) segments. The comparability of customer/licensee concentrations for the periods presented are impacted by the timing of customer/licensees device launches and/or innovation cycles and other seasonal trends, among other fluctuations in demand.

      "answer": "Intel positions the DCAI segment as a key growth driver, particularly through its focus on AI capabilities and infrastructure processing units (page 103). The internal foundry model, effective in 2024, creates a formalized relationship between Intel Products (which includes DCAI) and Intel Foundry, where intersegment manufacturing charges are applied (page 70). This structure exposes DCAI to financial risks outlined in the Loss Contingencies section, such as liabilities related to product defects and warranty claims. If a loss from such contingencies is deemed 'probable and reasonably estimable,' it would directly impact the DCAI segment\u2019s financials through these intersegment charges. This interdependency highlights how strategic growth in DCAI could be constrained by operational risks tied to manufacturing dependencies under the new model.",

A  discussion regarding our consolidated results of operations for 2023 relative to 2022 is included in our 2023 Form 10-K. \"Note 3: Operating Segments\" within Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Form 10-K reconciles our segment and consolidated results for each of the periods presented.\n\nSee \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" w ithin MD&amp;A. 1\n\n## Operating Segment Trends and Results\n\n## Intel Products\n\nIntel Products consists substantially of the design, development, marketing, sale, support, and servicing of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Products is composed of three operating segments: CCG, DCAI, and NEX.\n\n## Client Computing Group\n\n## Market and Business Overview\n\n## Overview\n\nWe are committed to advancing PC experiences by delivering competitive products and deepening our relationships with industry partners to co-engineer and deliver leading platform innovation. We bring together the operating system, system architecture, hardware, and software application integration to enable industry-leading PC experiences. We embrace these opportunities by focusing on our roadmap, delivering innovative PC capabilities, and designing advanced PC experiences. By doing this, we believe we help fuel innovation across the industry, providing a solid source of IP, scale, and cash flow for Intel.\n\n## Market Trends and Strategy\n\nIn 2024, the PC market started to stabilize from a soft macroeconomic environment and inflationary pressures, with PC supply and demand levels beginning to normalize. We remain positive on the long-term outlook for PCs, as household density is stable to increasing, educational device penetration rates remain low outside of the US, and PC usage remains elevated compared to pre-pandemic rates . Commercial growth opportunities also remain as corporations expand the size of their PC fleets, while also replacing older devices. Currently, more than 200 million commercial devices are more than four years old . 1 2\n\nWe recently introduced our Intel Core Ultra processor family that serves as the CPU for the A I PC, which enables A I capabilities at the client level. We believe the A I PC is a significant potential driver of PC demand over the coming years, and believe we are well-positioned to capitalize on this trend that we expect will support a long-term PC TAM  of 300 million units . 3\n\nWe deliver value to our customers by leveraging our engineering capabilities and working with our partners across an open, innovative ecosystem to deliver technology that drives every major aspect of the computing experience, including performance, power efficiency, battery life, connectivity, graphics, and form factors, to create the most advanced PC platforms. We design our products with a philosophy of openness and choice, and seek to continually provide more competitive products with more capabilities for customers.\n\n## Products and Competition\n\nIn 2023, we introduced a significant update to our client compute brands to make it easier for customers to identify the right client solutions for their compute needs. Those brands include Intel, Intel Core and Intel Core Ultra. The Intel and Intel Core brands have been staples of the PC industry for nearly two decades and represented our highest volume products by unit sales in 2024. These products are designed to serve a broad cross-section of the customer and computing needs in the client market.\n\nThe Intel Core Ultra processor family, which we launched at the end of 2023, delivers significant advancements in graphics, A I, and multi-threaded CPU performance and introduced the AI PC to the market. In the second half of 2024, the next-generation Intel Core Ultra 200V  Series became our highest performance client processors, with increased battery life for mobile PCs. We also introduced the Intel Core Ultra 200S Series processors, catering to the desktop enthusiast market. We remain committed to delivering the most advanced processing power to support the growing demands of AI, graphics, and multithreaded workloads.\n\nWe operate in a particularly competitive market. In processors, we compete with A dvanced M icro Devices, Inc. (A M D) and vendors who design applications processors based on ARM architecture, such as Apple Inc. (A pple) with its M  series products and Qualcomm Inc. (Qualcomm) with its Snapdragon product. We expect this competitive environment to continue to intensify in 2025.\n\nWe remain committed to creating an open ecosystem to foster growth and technology innovations. We embrace and collaborate with a global ecosystem of industry partners to deliver competitive technologies together.\n\n- Source: Intel calculated PC density from industry analyst reports. 1\n- Source: Intel calculated volume of devices over four years old from industry analyst reports and internal data. 2\n- Source: Intel calculated multi-year TAM forecast derived from industry analyst reports. 3\n\nMD&amp;A",

A n estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Note 3 : Operating Segments\n\nWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utiliz e marketing, sales, and other support functions.\n\nOur internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate A ltera as a standalone business. A ltera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" A s a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. A ll prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our operating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.\n\nWe organize our business as follows:\n\n- Intel Products:\n- Client Computing Group (CCG)\n- Data Center and AI (DCAI)\n- Network and Edge (NEX)\n- Intel Foundry\n- All other:\n- Altera\n- Mobileye\n- Other\n\nCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX , A ltera, and M obileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.\n\nThe accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A  summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:\n\n## Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX\n\n- Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.\n- Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n68",

      "answer": "Intel's stake in Mobileye, valued at $10.919 billion as of December 30, 2023, indicates a strategic commitment to the autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) market. However, the non-controlling interests related to Mobileye grew significantly\u2014from $989 million in 2022 to $1.838 billion in 2024\u2014suggesting that external investors or partners have increased their equity stakes in Mobileye during this period. This increase in non-controlling interests could reflect external capital infusions or equity reallocations that diluted Intel\u2019s ownership percentage or reduced its control over Mobileye. The growth in non-controlling interests, despite Intel\u2019s unchanged direct investment, highlights a shift in the ownership structure of Mobileye and may signal growing third-party confidence in its business model or technology platform.",

Despite this loss-making trend, the company maintained a stable long-term asset allocation to Network and Edge, holding $2,809 million in assets for the segment in both 2022 and 2023.

      "answer": "Health & Public Service generated $13.8B in FY24, representing approximately 21.3% of ACN's total FY24 revenue of $64.9B. This segment is strategically positioned with 69% of its revenue coming from the public sector, including defense, public safety, justice, education, and transportation agencies. Compared to other industry groups like Communications, Media & Technology ($10.8B, 16.7% of total revenue) and Financial Services ($11.6B, 18.0%), Health & Public Service is ACN\u2019s largest segment and has the highest public sector exposure. This positioning suggests a strategic emphasis on stable, long-term government and institutional contracts, which differentiates ACN\u2019s revenue base and may provide resilience during economic uncertainty.",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm's QSI segment contributing $104 million to earnings before taxes in 2024 reflect the strategic value of its investments, particularly when weighed against the company's substantial unallocated expenses that same year?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm's QSI segment, which focuses on strategic investments, contributed $104 million to earnings before taxes (EBT) in 2024, a significant turnaround from a loss of $12 million in 2023 (as shown in the segment EBT table). This positive shift highlights the growing strategic value of QSI's investment portfolio. However, when viewed alongside the broader unallocated expenses\u2014such as unallocated R&D ($2,277 million), selling, general and administrative expenses ($781 million), and interest expense ($697 million)\u2014the overall financial burden of these unallocated costs, which totaled $3,322 million in 2024, raises questions about the relative impact of QSI\u2019s contribution within the broader context of the company\u2019s operating performance. Despite QSI's improvement, the significant unallocated expenses suggest that the segment's positive EBT contribution was modest in comparison to the overall corporate cost structure.",

        "Hop 1: [QCOM](page_82) \u2192 [QSI]: QSI is described as Qualcomm's strategic investments segment, reflecting long-term strategic goals and managed separately from core operations.",

        "Hop 3: [EBT] \u2190 [QCOM](page_83): EBT is influenced by a range of unallocated corporate expenses, including $2,277 million in unallocated R&D and $697 million in interest expense, which collectively outweighed QSI\u2019s contribution."

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

      "answer": "Cisco's lease receivables as of July 30, 2022, totaled $313 million, with $152 million rated in the lowest internal credit risk category (1 to 4), and $151 million in the moderate category (5 to 6). These receivables are described as primarily consisting of sales-type leases tied to Cisco's and third-party products, often collateralized by the underlying assets. However, in the broader lease classifications listed in the 10-K, sales-type leases are presented only as a general category without any specific financial exposure details. This contrast reveals that while Cisco actively manages a significant and structured financial exposure through sales-type leases, the lack of granular credit risk disclosure in the lease classification section masks the potential financial volatility tied to these arrangements, especially for lower-rated receivables.",

      "answer": "QTL's revenue increased by 5% in fiscal 2024, primarily due to higher estimated sales of 3G/4G/5G-based multimode products. This revenue growth positively impacted its EBT contribution, which rose to $4,027 million in 2024 from $3,628 million in 2023. In contrast, QSI reported a much smaller revenue base with a decline from $28 million in 2023 to $18 million in 2024, and its EBT contribution was only $104 million in 2024, compared to a loss of $12 million in the prior year. This indicates that while QTL remains a strong and profitable contributor to Qualcomm\u2019s overall performance, QSI continues to operate at a smaller scale with significantly lower profitability. Thus, QTL's performance in both revenue growth and EBT contribution far surpasses that of the QSI segment.",

      "answer": "The Analog segment had $4,158 million in goodwill allocated to it as of the most recent disclosure. Over the past two years, the segment contributed $8,425 million to gross profit in 2023 and $10,749 million in 2022. This indicates a decline in its gross profit contribution year-over-year, despite the significant goodwill value. This contrast suggests potential overvaluation or concerns about the segment's ability to maintain prior performance levels, especially given the high asset valuation relative to recent earnings performance.",

      "answer": "Intel's 2024 capital expenditures totaled $23.9 billion, reflecting its continued heavy investment in manufacturing and fabrication capabilities. A key source of financing for these investments comes from SCIP partner contributions, with Arizona SCIP alone contributing $1.511 billion in 2024. Despite Intel maintaining a 49% non-controlling ownership stake in Arizona SCIP since 2022, the significant partner contributions highlight a strategic shift toward shared funding of large-scale semiconductor projects. This aligns with Intel's broader capital strategy to offset cash outflows through external financing sources, as evidenced by the increased cash provided by financing activities in 2024 driven by higher SCIP partner contributions.",

Our investing capital expenditures were $23.9 billion in 2024 ($25.8 billion in 2023 and $24.8 billion in 2022).\n\nThe decrease in cash used for investing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to lower purchases of short-term investments, lower capital expenditures, higher proceeds from capital-related government incentives, and higher sales of equity investments. These 2024 cash favorable activities were partially  offset by  lower maturities and sales of short-term inv estments and higher 2024 cash used in other investing activities.\n\n## Financing Activities\n\nFinancing cash flows consist primarily of proceeds from strategic initiatives, including partner contributions and equity-related issuances, issuance and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms, and payment of dividends to stockholders.\n\nThe increase in cash provided by financing activities in 2024 compared to 2023 was primarily due to higher SCIP partner contributions, reduced dividend payments, and other cash favorable financing activities in 2024. These 2024 cash favorable financing activities were partially offset by lower proceeds from debt issuances, net of repayments; the absence of proceeds from sales of subsidiary shares; and higher financing for capital expenditures with non-standard payment terms in 2024.",

      "answer": "The $947 million revenue generated by the Other segment in 2024 includes DLP products, calculators, and ASICs, but also incorporates corporate-level items such as environmental costs, which are not used in evaluating or allocating resources to the segment. This means that while the revenue figure appears substantial, the segment's performance is not assessed based on this total revenue alone, but rather by excluding non-operational items like environmental costs. Therefore, the true operational performance of the Other segment may be lower than what the headline revenue suggests, as environmental costs are treated as separate from the segment\u2019s core business evaluation.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue. The accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the significant accounting policies and practices.\n\nThe CODM assesses the performance of our segments and decides how to allocate resources based on each segment's rev enue growth, gross margin and operating profit. The CODM utilizes these metrics by comparing budget v ersus actual results as well as benchmarking to our competitors.\n\n## Segment information\n\n",

      "question": "How does Qualcomm reconcile QSI's $104 million EBT in 2024 with its description of the segment as a vehicle for strategic investments, especially considering the segment's declining revenues from $31 million in 2022 to $18 million in 2024?",
      "answer": "Qualcomm reports that QSI generated $104 million in EBT in 2024, a significant turnaround from its $12 million loss in 2023 and $279 million loss in 2022, while also showing a consistent decline in revenues from $31 million in 2022 to $18 million in 2024. Despite these fluctuating financials, Qualcomm describes QSI as a segment dedicated to making strategic investments, suggesting that the company is willing to tolerate lower or inconsistent financial returns in exchange for long-term strategic benefits. This implies that QSI's value is not solely measured by its current financial performance but by its potential to generate future growth opportunities or technological synergies aligned with Qualcomm\u2019s broader corporate strategy.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

In contrast, TXN's overall cost of revenue was $6,547 million on total revenue of $15,641 million, representing a cost of revenue ratio of 41.9%.

According to the financial statements, this growth was primarily driven by investments in commercial sales and LinkedIn.

Research and development expenses also include third-party development  and  programming  costs,  localization  costs  incurred  to  translate  software  for  international  markets,  and  the amortization  of  purchased  software  code  and  services  content.  Such  costs  related  to  software  development  are  included  in research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is generally  shortly  before  the  products  are  released  to  production.  Once  technological  feasibility  is  reached,  such  costs  are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.\n\n## Sales and Marketing\n\nSales  and  marketing  expenses  include  payroll,  employee  benefits,  stock-based  compensation  expense,  and  other  headcountrelated expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.6 billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n\n## Stock-Based Compensation\n\nCompensation  cost  for  stock  awards,  which  include  restricted  stock  units  ('RSUs')  and  performance  stock  units  ('PSUs'),  is measured at the fair value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo  valuation  model.  Compensation  cost  for  RSUs  is  recognized  using  the  straight-line  method  and  for  PSUs  is  recognized using the accelerated method.\n\nCompensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan ('ESPP') is measured as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of purchase.\n\n## Income Taxes\n\nIncome tax expense includes U.S. and international income taxes, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely  than  not  that  a  tax  benefit  will  not  be  realized. All  deferred  income  taxes  are  classified  as  long-term  in  our  consolidated balance sheets.\n\n## Financial Instruments\n\n## Investments\n\nWe consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.",

      "answer": "The Embedded Processing segment's operating profit contribution dropped from $1,253 million in 2022 to $1,008 million in 2023, indicating a decline in profitability. This segment also carries only $172 million in goodwill according to the balance sheet allocation, which is significantly lower than the $4,158 million in Analog. The reduced profitability relative to goodwill suggests that Embedded Processing may be generating less value from its asset base compared to other segments, raising questions about its performance efficiency or potential impairment risk.",

      "answer": "The Embedded Processing segment contributed $1,218 million to the overall gross profit of $9,094 million in 2024, representing approximately 13.4% of total gross profit. This segment also contributed $1,315 million to the total cost of revenue, which was $6,547 million for the year. The segment\u2019s cost of revenue and gross profit indicate that while it contributes a modest share of total gross profit, it accounts for a slightly higher proportion of total cost of revenue (about 20.1%), suggesting lower relative profitability compared to other business segments.",

      "answer": "The decline in Texas Instruments' operating profit from $7,331 million in 2023 to $5,465 million in 2024 is partially attributable to the weak performance of the Embedded Processing segment. Despite generating $2,533 million in revenue, this segment contributed only $352 million to the total operating profit, indicating a low operating margin. This underperformance, in the context of broader cost pressures and restructuring impacts, likely contributed to the overall drop in profitability.",

      "answer": "Intel's non-controlling interests in Mobileye increased from $989 million in 2022 to $1,838 million by 2023, indicating a growing financial stake and associated liability or equity shifts from external investors. Despite this, Intel's consolidated assets list Mobileye's value at $10,919 million as of 2023, suggesting that Intel attributes significant standalone value to Mobileye within its broader portfolio. This contrast implies that while Intel maintains strategic ownership and asset valuation of Mobileye, the increasing non-controlling interest suggests greater external influence or investment in Mobileye\u2019s equity, potentially complicating Intel's full financial alignment and control over Mobileye\u2019s future direction.",

      "question": "How does Intel's internal foundry model, which positions Intel Foundry to serve both Intel Products and external customers, reconcile with the significant year-over-year reduction in Intel Products' operating expenses, particularly given the increased intersegment manufacturing dependency outlined in the segment reporting?",
      "answer": "Intel Foundry, introduced as a separate operating model in 2024, is designed to serve both Intel Products and external customers by providing advanced manufacturing capabilities, including leading-edge process technologies like Intel 18A expected in 2025. This internal foundry model is intended to improve transparency, efficiency, and cost accountability. However, Intel Products' operating expenses dropped by $3.1 billion in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by cost-reduction measures across its segments (CCG, DCAI, NEX). Despite this reduction, the segment reporting on page 70 reveals that Intel Products continues to rely heavily on Intel Foundry for manufacturing, incurring intersegment charges for these services. This creates a tension: while Intel Products is cutting costs, it remains operationally dependent on Intel Foundry, which requires significant capital investment to maintain leading-edge capabilities. The internal foundry model may aim to offset some of these costs through third-party revenue, but the immediate financial impact shows Intel Products reducing expenses while still relying on Intel Foundry's infrastructure, suggesting a strategic balancing act between cost control and long-term manufacturing competitiveness.",

As the stewards of M oore's Law, we aim to continue to innovate and advance world-class silicon process and advanced packaging technologies. Our foundry offerings benefit from several key advantages: our robust design ecosystem with key industry partners; our systems of chips capabilities; and our secure, resilient, and sustainable supply chain. Our foundry is built on the foundation of our silicon process and advanced packaging technology offerings and enables co-optimized solutions for the A I era. We are strengthening the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain for leadingedge and mature node semiconductor products by investing in geographically balanced and more sustainable manufacturing capacity. As a foundry for the A I era, Intel Foundry brings together these critical components to help drive the next phase of technology innovation.\n\n## Market Trends and Strategy\n\nAI is driv ing transformational changes in the global market for semiconductors. A I demands an ever-increasing amount of computation performance and an everincreasing need for power efficiency. To deliver the step function changes in performant yet efficient and cost-effective systems required to enable A I, a generational shift in computer architectures is underway, built on smaller, more efficient and performant transistors. A rchitectures are shifting from general monolithic silicon chips to systems of interconnected chiplets optimized for specific workloads and market segments, requiring more advanced packaging technologies to stitch together these increasingly complex designs. The global semiconductor industry and our customers are changing the way they build chips and systems while simultaneously redesigning their supply chains to be more resilient and sustainable.\n\nOver time, the capital intensity of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing has grown meaningfully and forced most manufacturers to give up the pursuit of Moore's Law as they lacked sufficient scale to drive a positive return on investments in the next-generation process technology. Currently, we believe we are only one of three manufacturers pursuing 2nm lithography. Leading-edge foundries seek to amortize their leading-edge investments over many years. In early years, they seek to maximize volume and pricing on leading-edge designs that benefit from the most performant transistors. In later years, when the once advanced process technology becomes a mature technology, ease of design and manufacturing cost become more paramount.\n\nOur strategy builds on our history of developing leading-edge semiconductor technologies for our products. While we expect our manufacturing facilities to continue to mostly produce our own products for many years to come, we are aiming to become a major provider of semiconductor manufacturing solutions for third parties as well. A s we pursue that strategy, the volume from our own products helps provide the significant scale required for leading-edge foundry operations and helps derisk our foundry offerings for our third-party customers. The addition of third-party customers would, on the leading edge, help provide further scale to support our foundry operations and, for process nodes that are mature, enable better monetization of our technology and manufacturing facility investments. We plan to create greater independence for our foundry operations by establishing Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We expect this to provide Intel Foundry with clearer separation and independence for foundry customers and suppliers and increase our flexibility to evaluate separate sources of funding and capital structures for our foundry and product businesses.\n\n## Products, Serv ices, and Competition\n\nIntel Foundry combines technology, manufacturing, supply chain, and systems capabilities to enable systems to be optimized for their workloads while providing resilience and sustainability in the supply chain. Intel Foundry aims to deliver leading-edge process technology and to build out offerings of mature process nodes for third parties. Our factory network provides geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. Intel Foundry enables Intel Products and external customers to benefit from our advanced technologies, systems capabilities, and manufacturing network, and we expect to achieve volume production of products on our 2nm node, Intel 18A , in 2025.\n\nWe seek to address the transformational shift in the semiconductor industry being driven by A I and the demand for ever-increasing computation power by providing leading foundry capabilities to support Intel Products and external customers, delivered from a resilient, secure, and more sustainable supply chain. Intel Foundry's offerings are foundational and consist of advanced process technologies enabled by an ecosystem of electronic design automation tools, intellectual property, and design services from vendors used by our external customers. This ecosystem enables external customers to design with Intel technologies as they would with other foundries. The systems of chips capabilities include architecture, advanced packaging technologies, software, and services to accelerate time to market, and driving standards to improve system performance and power consumption.\n\nMD&amp;A",

A rchitectures are shifting from general monolithic silicon chips to systems of interconnected chiplets optimized for specific workloads and market segments, requiring more advanced packaging technologies to stitch together these increasingly complex designs. The global semiconductor industry and our customers are changing the way they build chips and systems while simultaneously redesigning their supply chains to be more resilient and sustainable.\n\nOver time, the capital intensity of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing has grown meaningfully and forced most manufacturers to give up the pursuit of Moore's Law as they lacked sufficient scale to drive a positive return on investments in the next-generation process technology. Currently, we believe we are only one of three manufacturers pursuing 2nm lithography. Leading-edge foundries seek to amortize their leading-edge investments over many years. In early years, they seek to maximize volume and pricing on leading-edge designs that benefit from the most performant transistors. In later years, when the once advanced process technology becomes a mature technology, ease of design and manufacturing cost become more paramount.\n\nOur strategy builds on our history of developing leading-edge semiconductor technologies for our products. While we expect our manufacturing facilities to continue to mostly produce our own products for many years to come, we are aiming to become a major provider of semiconductor manufacturing solutions for third parties as well. A s we pursue that strategy, the volume from our own products helps provide the significant scale required for leading-edge foundry operations and helps derisk our foundry offerings for our third-party customers. The addition of third-party customers would, on the leading edge, help provide further scale to support our foundry operations and, for process nodes that are mature, enable better monetization of our technology and manufacturing facility investments. We plan to create greater independence for our foundry operations by establishing Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We expect this to provide Intel Foundry with clearer separation and independence for foundry customers and suppliers and increase our flexibility to evaluate separate sources of funding and capital structures for our foundry and product businesses.\n\n## Products, Serv ices, and Competition\n\nIntel Foundry combines technology, manufacturing, supply chain, and systems capabilities to enable systems to be optimized for their workloads while providing resilience and sustainability in the supply chain. Intel Foundry aims to deliver leading-edge process technology and to build out offerings of mature process nodes for third parties. Our factory network provides geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. Intel Foundry enables Intel Products and external customers to benefit from our advanced technologies, systems capabilities, and manufacturing network, and we expect to achieve volume production of products on our 2nm node, Intel 18A , in 2025.\n\nWe seek to address the transformational shift in the semiconductor industry being driven by A I and the demand for ever-increasing computation power by providing leading foundry capabilities to support Intel Products and external customers, delivered from a resilient, secure, and more sustainable supply chain. Intel Foundry's offerings are foundational and consist of advanced process technologies enabled by an ecosystem of electronic design automation tools, intellectual property, and design services from vendors used by our external customers. This ecosystem enables external customers to design with Intel technologies as they would with other foundries. The systems of chips capabilities include architecture, advanced packaging technologies, software, and services to accelerate time to market, and driving standards to improve system performance and power consumption.\n\nMD&amp;A",

A n estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Note 3 : Operating Segments\n\nWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utiliz e marketing, sales, and other support functions.\n\nOur internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate A ltera as a standalone business. A ltera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" A s a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. A ll prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our operating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.\n\nWe organize our business as follows:\n\n- Intel Products:\n- Client Computing Group (CCG)\n- Data Center and AI (DCAI)\n- Network and Edge (NEX)\n- Intel Foundry\n- All other:\n- Altera\n- Mobileye\n- Other\n\nCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX , A ltera, and M obileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.\n\nThe accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A  summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:\n\n## Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX\n\n- Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.\n- Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n68",

      "answer": "The Embedded Processing segment contributed $352 million to TXN's total operating profit of $5,465 million in 2024, despite receiving $475 million in R&D investment, which exceeds its contribution to profitability. This suggests that the segment is in a high-investment phase, potentially to drive future growth. This aligns with TXN\u2019s broader trend of declining operating profit from $7,331 million in 2023 to $5,465 million in 2024, indicating that high R&D spending in segments like Embedded Processing may be part of a strategic pivot toward long-term innovation despite near-term margin pressure.",

      "question": "How does Intel's valuation of its Mobileye segment as of December 30, 2023, relate to the increase in non-controlling interests attributed to Mobileye during the same period, and what does this imply about external investment trends in Intel's autonomous driving initiatives?",
      "answer": "Intel valued its Mobileye segment at $10.919 billion as of December 30, 2023, indicating a significant strategic asset. During the same fiscal year, non-controlling interests attributed to Mobileye increased from $989 million to $1.838 billion, reflecting substantial external investment inflows. This rise in non-controlling interests suggests growing third-party confidence and participation in Mobileye\u2019s growth, particularly in Intel\u2019s autonomous driving and ADAS-focused ventures, aligning with Intel\u2019s broader strategic pivot toward mobility and AI-driven technologies.",

      "answer": "In 2023, the Analog segment was allocated $1,287 million in Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) expenses, which is significantly lower than its goodwill balance of $4,158 million disclosed on page 52. This suggests that while TXN maintains a substantial historical investment in Analog reflected through goodwill, the segment's SG&A allocation in 2023 indicates a relatively leaner investment in administrative support compared to its embedded processing and other segments. Comparing this with 2022, where Analog's SG&A was $1,212 million, the increase in 2023 is modest despite a drop in segment revenue from $15,359 million to $13,040 million, potentially signaling a strategic shift in cost management for the Analog business.",

      "answer": "The 1.7 percentage point increase in services gross margin, attributed to lower headcount-related and delivery costs, directly contributed to the improved gross margin performance of the Americas segment. According to the document, the Americas segment experienced a gross margin percentage increase due to productivity benefits, favorable product mix, and higher services gross margin, despite being partially offset by negative pricing impacts. This aligns with the broader context that the Americas segment reported $24.035 billion in revenue for fiscal year 2023, indicating that the margin improvement helped enhance profitability within the region's largest revenue base.",

In EMEA, Public Service was a growth driver, contributing to flat overall regional revenue performance in FY24 despite declines in Communications & Media and Banking & Capital Markets. This suggests that while Public Service is a strong vertical, broader regional challenges in Europe, particularly in France and the UK, constrained overall growth.

      "answer": "The significant year-over-year decline in EBT for QSI\u2014from $916 million in 2021 to a loss of $279 million in 2022\u2014highlights a shift in the performance of Qualcomm\u2019s strategic investments, which are managed through the QSI segment. Despite QSI's minimal revenue contribution of $31 million in 2022 (compared to $37.7 billion from QCT), its EBT volatility directly impacts the company's overall pre-tax earnings. This underscores the risk associated with strategic investments, which, while not core revenue drivers, can materially affect financial performance. The QSI segment's purpose, as outlined in the segment information, is to make long-term strategic bets aligned with Qualcomm's broader technology roadmap, which may involve higher risk and short-term financial unpredictability in exchange for potential future gains.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, certain share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development expenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters. Our CODM does not evaluate our operating segments using discrete asset information.",

      "answer": "Texas Instruments' operating profit declined from $7,331 million in 2023 to $5,465 million in 2024, as disclosed in the consolidated income statement (page 25). This drop is reflected in the segment-level data (page 30), where the Analog Segment, which contributes $4,608 million to the 2024 operating profit, experienced a significant reduction from its historically dominant role. Given that the Analog Segment accounts for the vast majority of the company's revenue ($12,161 million out of $15,641 million total in 2024) and its operating profit represents 84% of the total $5,465 million, the decline in its relative profitability likely drove the overall drop in company-wide operating profit.

At the same time, the segment generated $947 million in revenue out of the company's total revenue of $15,641 million, which is about 6.1% of total revenue. This indicates that the 'Other' segment's cost structure is relatively proportional to its revenue contribution, suggesting efficient cost management within this segment compared to its revenue generation.",

This segment also served as a key growth driver for the Growth Markets geographic unit, which saw a 7% local currency revenue increase in FY24, particularly in Japan and Argentina. This dual involvement highlights how a major industry group contributes not only to a core revenue segment but also to geographic expansion and performance, especially in high-growth regions.",

Description of business, including segment and geographic area information\n\nWe design and manufacture semiconductors that we sell to electronics designers and manufacturers all ov er the world. We hav e two reportable segments, Analog and Embedded Processing, each of which represents groups of products that hav e similar design and dev elopment requirements, product characteristics and manufacturing processes. Our segments reflect how our chief operating decision maker (CODM), which is our chief executiv e officer, allocates resources and measures results.\n\n- Analog semiconductors change real-world signals, such as sound, temperature, pressure or images, by conditioning them, amplifying them and often conv erting them to a stream of digital data that can be processed by other semiconductors, such as embedded processors. Analog semiconductors are also used to manage power in all electronic equipment by conv erting, distributing, storing, discharging, isolating and measuring electrical energy, whether the equipment is plugged into a wall or using a battery. Our Analog segment consists of two major product lines: Power and Signal Chain.\n- Embedded Processing products are the digital 'brains' of many types of electronic equipment. They are designed to handle specific tasks and can be optimized for v arious combinations of performance, power and cost, depending on the application.\n\nWe report the results of our remaining business activ ities in Other. Other includes operating segments that do not meet the quantitativ e thresholds for indiv idually reportable segments and cannot be aggregated with other operating segments. Other includes DLP  products, calculators and custom ASIC products. \u00ae\n\nIn Other, we also include items that are not used in ev aluating the results of or in allocating resources to our segments. Examples of these items include acquisition, integration and restructuring charges (see Note 11); and certain corporate-lev el items, such as litigation expenses, env ironmental costs, insurance settlements, and gains and losses from other activ ities, including asset dispositions. We allocate the remainder of our expenses associated with corporate activ ities to our operating segments based on specific methodologies, such as percentage of operating expenses or headcount.\n\nOur centralized manufacturing and support organizations, such as facilities, procurement and logistics, prov ide support to our operating segments, including those in Other. Costs incurred by these organizations, including depreciation, are charged to the segments on a per-unit basis. Consequently, depreciation expense is not an independently identifiable component within the segments' results and, therefore, is not prov ided.\n\nWith the exception of goodwill, we do not identify or allocate assets by operating segment, nor does the CODM ev aluate operating segments using discrete asset information. We hav e no material intersegment rev enue.

      "answer": "The 2% overall growth in North America revenues was achieved despite a decline in the Banking & Capital Markets segment, which contributes 42% of the $11.6B in Financial Services revenues. This suggests that other sectors within North America, such as Public Service and Industrial, were able to offset the weakness in financial services. Furthermore, the impending reclassification of Latin America into the North America market in Q1 fiscal 2025 indicates a strategic geographic realignment that could potentially amplify or mitigate the current regional performance depending on Latin America's contribution to the broader financial services segment.",

      "answer": "The Analog segment accounted for $4,869 million, or approximately 74.4% of Texas Instruments' total cost of revenue of $6,547 million in 2024. This aligns with the segment's dominant revenue contribution of $12,161 million, representing 77.8% of the company's total revenue of $15,641 million. This indicates that the Analog segment not only drives the majority of the company's revenue but also incurs the largest portion of the cost of revenue, reflecting its central role in TXN's operations.",

This segment generates substantially all of its revenues from licensing fees recognized over time, primarily tied to royalties from licensees' sales of mobile handsets. A reduction in licensees' sales would result in lower royalty revenues for the QTL segment, directly affecting its financial performance and potentially reducing overall licensing revenues.",

          "chunk_text": "In any potential dispute involving us and another company's patents, copyrights, trademarks or other intellectual property, our chipset foundries, semiconductor assembly and test providers and customers could also become the targets of litigation. We are contingently liable under certain product sales, services, license and other agreements to indemnify certain customers, chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers against certain types of liability and damages arising from qualifying claims of patent infringement by products sold by us, or by intellectual property provided by us to our chipset foundries and semiconductor assembly and test service providers. Reimbursements under indemnification arrangements could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. Furthermore, litigation could severely disrupt the supply of our products and the businesses of our chipset customers and their customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing a corresponding decline in our chipset or licensing revenues. Any claims, regardless of their merit, could be time consuming to address, result in costly litigation, divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, cause product release or shipment delays and/or damage to our customer relationships, any of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\n\nWe may continue to be involved in litigation and may have to appear in front of administrative bodies (such as the United States International Trade Commission) to defend against patent assertions against our products by companies, some of whom are attempting to gain competitive advantage or leverage in licensing negotiations. We may not be successful in such proceedings, and if we are not, the range of possible outcomes is very broad and may include, for example, monetary damages or fines or other orders to pay money, royalty payments, injunctions on the sale of certain of our integrated circuit products (or on the sale of our customers' devices using such products) or the issuance of orders to cease certain conduct or modify our business practices. Further, a governmental body in a particular country or region may assert, and may be successful in imposing, remedies with effects that extend beyond the borders of that country or region. In addition, a negative outcome in any such proceeding could severely disrupt the business of our customers and their wireless operator customers, which in turn could harm our relationships with them and could result in a decline in our chipset sales or a reduction in our licensees' sales, causing corresponding declines in our chipset or licensing revenues.\n\n## Our use of open source software may harm our business.\n\nCertain of our software and our suppliers' software may contain or may be derived from 'open source' software, and we have seen, and believe that we will continue to see, customers request that we develop products, including software associated with our integrated circuit products, that incorporate open source software elements and operate in an open source environment, which, under certain open source licenses, may offer accessibility to a portion of our products' source code and may expose our related intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. Licensing of such open source software may impose certain obligations on us if we were to distribute derivative works of that software. For example, these obligations may require us to make source code for the derivative works available to our customers in a manner that allows them to make such source code available to their customers, or to license such derivative works under a particular type of license that is different than what we customarily use to license our software. Furthermore, in the course of product development, we may make contributions to third-party open source projects that could subject our intellectual property to adverse licensing conditions. For example, to encourage the growth of a software ecosystem that is interoperable with our products, we may need to contribute certain implementations under the open source licensing terms that govern such projects, which may adversely impact our associated intellectual property. Developing open source products, while adequately protecting the intellectual property upon which our licensing programs depend, may prove burdensome and time-consuming under certain circumstances, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage, and we may not adequately protect our intellectual property.\n\n## GENERAL RISK FACTORS\n\nWe operate in the highly cyclical semiconductor industry, which is subject to significant downturns. We are also susceptible to declines in global, regional and local economic conditions generally. Our stock price and financial results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations due to these dynamics, among others.\n\nThe semiconductor industry is highly cyclical, volatile, subject to downturns and characterized by constant and rapid technological change, price erosion, evolving technical standards, frequent new product introductions, short product life cycles and fluctuations in product supply and demand. Periods of downturns have been characterized by diminished demand for end-user products, high inventory levels, excess or obsolete inventory adjustments or reserves, underutilization of manufacturing capacity, changes in revenue mix and erosion of average selling prices. During such downturns, our revenues have declined, and our results of operations and financial condition have been adversely impacted.

      "answer": "The QTL segment, with an asset base of $733 million as of September 24, 2023, generated $5,306 million in licensing revenues during FY2023, indicating a high asset turnover ratio and strong revenue efficiency. This contrasts with the QCT segment, which, although larger in asset size at $9,909 million, operates in a more capital-intensive semiconductor business. The QTL segment\u2019s licensing model leverages Qualcomm\u2019s extensive patent portfolio with minimal capital investment, resulting in higher margins (72% EBT as a % of revenues in FY2023) compared to the QCT segment, which faces higher operational costs due to manufacturing, R&D, and competitive pressures in the chipset market. This highlights the strategic advantage of the licensing model in delivering substantial returns with limited asset deployment.",

      "answer": "TXN reports that Embedded Processing has only $172 in goodwill, indicating limited strategic investment or acquisition emphasis in this segment relative to others like Analog, which holds $4,158 in goodwill. However, the Embedded Processing segment contributes $1,493 to the company's total $6,500 cost of revenue, representing over 22% of the total cost base. This suggests that despite being a smaller segment in terms of asset valuation or strategic emphasis (as reflected in goodwill), it plays a relatively significant role in the company's operational cost structure.

      "question": "How does Intel's internal foundry model, which creates a transactional relationship between Intel Products and Intel Foundry, reconcile with the $755 million charge recognized in 2024 related to construction delays at Fab 34 in Ireland, and what does this imply about the financial risks of Intel Foundry's strategy to become a major third-party foundry?",
      "answer": "Intel's internal foundry model, implemented in Q1 2024, establishes a formal transactional relationship between Intel Products (CCG, DCAI, NEX) and Intel Foundry, where Intel Products pays Intel Foundry for manufacturing services. This internal structure is intended to increase transparency and cost accountability. However, Intel Foundry also aims to serve external customers and expand its manufacturing footprint, including through joint ventures like the one with Apollo for Fab 34 in Ireland. In Q4 2024, Intel recognized a $755 million charge due to construction delays at Fab 34, which were tied to reduced near-term capacity requirements. This charge highlights the financial risks inherent in Intel Foundry\u2019s strategy to scale as a third-party foundry, particularly in meeting contractual obligations and managing capital-intensive projects. The internal model may improve cost discipline, but the Fab 34 penalty underscores the broader risk that external foundry expansion may not yield expected returns, especially when tied to complex partnerships and aggressive timelines.",

A n estimated loss from such contingencies is recognized as a charge to income if it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate developments that could affect prior disclosures or previously accrued liabilities, and make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being, and the estimated amount of, a loss related to such matters. If one or more of these matters were resolved against us for amounts in excess of management's estimates of losses, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n\n## Note 3 : Operating Segments\n\nWe previously announced the implementation of our internal foundry operating model, which took effect in the first quarter of 2024, and creates a foundry relationship between our Intel Products business (collectively CCG, DCA I, and NEX ) and our Intel Foundry business. Intel Products consists substantially of design and development of CPUs and related solutions for external customers. Intel Foundry consists substantially of process engineering, manufacturing, and foundry services groups that provide manufacturing, test, and assembly services to our Intel Products business and to external customers. Both businesses utiliz e marketing, sales, and other support functions.\n\nOur internal foundry model is a key component of our strategy and is designed to reshape our operational dynamics and drive greater transparency, accountability, and focus on costs and efficiency. We also previously announced our intent to operate A ltera as a standalone business. A ltera was previously included in our DCAI segment results and, beginning in the first quarter of 2024, is included in \"all other.\" A s a result of these changes, we modified our segment reporting in the first quarter of 2024 to align to this new operating model. A ll prior period segment data has been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the way our CODMs internally receive information and manage and monitor our operating segment performance. There are no changes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any prior periods.\n\nWe organize our business as follows:\n\n- Intel Products:\n- Client Computing Group (CCG)\n- Data Center and AI (DCAI)\n- Network and Edge (NEX)\n- Intel Foundry\n- All other:\n- Altera\n- Mobileye\n- Other\n\nCCG, DCAI, and Intel Foundry qualify as reportable operating segments. NEX , A ltera, and M obileye do not qualify as reportable operating segments; however, we have elected to disclose certain of their results. When we enter into federal contracts, they are aligned to the sponsoring operating segment.\n\nThe accounting policies applied to our segments follow those applied to Intel as a whole. A  summary of the basis for which we report our operating segment revenues and operating margin is as follows:\n\n## Intel Products: CCG, DCAI, and NEX\n\n- Segment revenue: Consists of revenues from external customers. Our Intel Products operating segments represent most of Intel consolidated revenue and are derived from our principal products that incorporate various components and technologies, including a microprocessor and chipset, a stand-alone SoC, or a multichip package, which are based on Intel architecture.\n- Segment expenses: Consists of intersegment charges for product manufacturing and related services from Intel Foundry, external foundry and other manufacturing expenses, product development costs, allocated expenses as described below, and direct operating expenses.\n\nFinancial Statem ents\n\nNotes to C onsolidated F inancial Statem ents\n\n68",

As the stewards of M oore's Law, we aim to continue to innovate and advance world-class silicon process and advanced packaging technologies. Our foundry offerings benefit from several key advantages: our robust design ecosystem with key industry partners; our systems of chips capabilities; and our secure, resilient, and sustainable supply chain. Our foundry is built on the foundation of our silicon process and advanced packaging technology offerings and enables co-optimized solutions for the A I era. We are strengthening the resilience of the global semiconductor supply chain for leadingedge and mature node semiconductor products by investing in geographically balanced and more sustainable manufacturing capacity. As a foundry for the A I era, Intel Foundry brings together these critical components to help drive the next phase of technology innovation.\n\n## Market Trends and Strategy\n\nAI is driv ing transformational changes in the global market for semiconductors. A I demands an ever-increasing amount of computation performance and an everincreasing need for power efficiency. To deliver the step function changes in performant yet efficient and cost-effective systems required to enable A I, a generational shift in computer architectures is underway, built on smaller, more efficient and performant transistors. A rchitectures are shifting from general monolithic silicon chips to systems of interconnected chiplets optimized for specific workloads and market segments, requiring more advanced packaging technologies to stitch together these increasingly complex designs. The global semiconductor industry and our customers are changing the way they build chips and systems while simultaneously redesigning their supply chains to be more resilient and sustainable.\n\nOver time, the capital intensity of leading-edge semiconductor manufacturing has grown meaningfully and forced most manufacturers to give up the pursuit of Moore's Law as they lacked sufficient scale to drive a positive return on investments in the next-generation process technology. Currently, we believe we are only one of three manufacturers pursuing 2nm lithography. Leading-edge foundries seek to amortize their leading-edge investments over many years. In early years, they seek to maximize volume and pricing on leading-edge designs that benefit from the most performant transistors. In later years, when the once advanced process technology becomes a mature technology, ease of design and manufacturing cost become more paramount.\n\nOur strategy builds on our history of developing leading-edge semiconductor technologies for our products. While we expect our manufacturing facilities to continue to mostly produce our own products for many years to come, we are aiming to become a major provider of semiconductor manufacturing solutions for third parties as well. A s we pursue that strategy, the volume from our own products helps provide the significant scale required for leading-edge foundry operations and helps derisk our foundry offerings for our third-party customers. The addition of third-party customers would, on the leading edge, help provide further scale to support our foundry operations and, for process nodes that are mature, enable better monetization of our technology and manufacturing facility investments. We plan to create greater independence for our foundry operations by establishing Intel Foundry as an independent subsidiary. We expect this to provide Intel Foundry with clearer separation and independence for foundry customers and suppliers and increase our flexibility to evaluate separate sources of funding and capital structures for our foundry and product businesses.\n\n## Products, Serv ices, and Competition\n\nIntel Foundry combines technology, manufacturing, supply chain, and systems capabilities to enable systems to be optimized for their workloads while providing resilience and sustainability in the supply chain. Intel Foundry aims to deliver leading-edge process technology and to build out offerings of mature process nodes for third parties. Our factory network provides geographically balanced manufacturing capacity. Intel Foundry enables Intel Products and external customers to benefit from our advanced technologies, systems capabilities, and manufacturing network, and we expect to achieve volume production of products on our 2nm node, Intel 18A , in 2025.\n\nWe seek to address the transformational shift in the semiconductor industry being driven by A I and the demand for ever-increasing computation power by providing leading foundry capabilities to support Intel Products and external customers, delivered from a resilient, secure, and more sustainable supply chain. Intel Foundry's offerings are foundational and consist of advanced process technologies enabled by an ecosystem of electronic design automation tools, intellectual property, and design services from vendors used by our external customers. This ecosystem enables external customers to design with Intel technologies as they would with other foundries. The systems of chips capabilities include architecture, advanced packaging technologies, software, and services to accelerate time to market, and driving standards to improve system performance and power consumption.\n\nMD&amp;A",

          "chunk_text": "## Our implementation of new business strategies and investments in new businesses, products, and technologies are inherently risky and do not always succeed.\n\nOur implementation of new business strategies, including our foundry strategy and our cost reduction measures, as well as our many internal structural, systems, and process changes, may subject us to a number of risks. We have entered new businesses and introduced new products and services as we seek to capitaliz e on the opportunities presented by growth in semiconductor demand, ubiquitous compute, pervasive connectivity, cloud-to-edge infrastructure, A I, and sensing. As part of our strategy, we announced plans to establish Intel Foundry as a major provider of foundry capacity to manufacture semiconductors for others and to implement an internal foundry operating model through updates to our processes, systems, and guardrails between our manufacturing and our individual product-based business units. The implementation of our internal foundry operating model requires many internal structural, system, and process changes to support the separation of the product and manufacturing sides of our business and our external foundry business, including a new enterprise resource planning system. In parallel, we are undertaking significant efforts to separate out portions of our business, such as operating Intel Foundry, A ltera and IM S, as autonomous subsidiaries that we majority own and consolidate in order to potentially raise capital and unlock value as we focus on our core product and manufacturing capabilities. Significant business changes are inherently risky and are not always successful. For example, in 2022, we wound down Intel Optane; in 2020, we agreed to sell our NA ND memory business to SK hynix; and in 2019, we exited the 5G smartphone modem business based on our determination that there was no clear path to profitability for those businesses.\n\nThese new and developing areas and products represent a significant portion of our revenue growth opportunity, and they also introduce new sources of competition in not just new and evolving markets but also in our existing markets. These new sources of competition can include established competitors with well-developed and highly competitive technologies, ecosystems, and customer bases, lower prices, margins, or costs, and greater brand recognition. These developing products and market segments require significant investment, do not always grow as projected or at all, or sometimes adopt competing technologies, and we may not realize an adequate return on our investments. For example, A I and machine learning are increasingly driving innovations in technology, but if we fail to dev elop leading products for these workloads, or if our customers use competing technologies, we may not realize a return on our investments in these areas. We may also not be successful in developing a competitive foundry business for external customers with respect to either leading-edge or mature process nodes, which would make it difficult for us to realize a favorable return on our investments in process technology and manufacturing capacity investments. To be successful, we need to cultivate relationships with customers and partners in these market segments and continue to improve our offerings. Despite our ongoing efforts, there is no guarantee that we will achieve or maintain market demand or acceptance for our products and services in these various market segments or realize an adequate return on our investments, which could lead to impairment of assets and restructuring charges, as well as opportunity costs.\n\n## Our Smart Capital approach to capital spending, alternative financing arrangements, and pursuit of government grants involves risks and may not be successful.\n\nAs we pursue our strategy, we have utilized our Smart Capital approach to capital spending in an effort to appropriately time and scale our capital investments. To support our capital investments, we have pursued alternative financing arrangements, such as our 2022 joint investment with Brookfield in the manufacturing expansion of our Arizona campus, and our 2024 joint investment with A pollo related to Fab 34 in Ireland, and may enter into similar arrangements in the future. These transactions may fail to advance our business strategy, may include unfavorable pricing or other terms such as penalties should key metrics not be attained as prescribed by our agreements, and may fail to achieve their anticipated benefits. Both arrangements include commitments we may not be able to satisfy, including commitments relating to construction and/or wafer demand or purchase, in which case we may be required to make additional payments to our partners. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized a $755 million charge related to penalties we expect to pay in connection with Ireland SCIP for construction delays we decided to make as we reduced our near-term capacity requirements. Further, both arrangements are expected to significantly and increasingly impact our net income (loss) attributable to Intel and earnings (loss) per share attributable to Intel in future periods as wafer production volumes increase at our expanded Arizona campus and at Fab 34 in Ireland. Our partners may also fail to satisfy financial or other obligations on which we rely and we may fail to resolv e any  potential disputes. A ny  of these risks, including our ability  to effectuate any  additional transactions at all, could hav e a material adv erse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition, or cash flows, which may limit our ability to raise sufficient capital for our required investments.\n\nIn addition, as part of our Smart Capital approach, we have applied for, received, and expect to receive additional grants and incentives from domestic and foreign local, regional, and national governments. Legislation in the US and EU has been adopted to provide government funding for semiconductor manufacturing expansions in those regions. However, any amounts, if any, we may receive under any agreements enabled by such legislation may not be sufficient in amount or timeliness to support our capital investment plans and offset the higher costs of operations in many of the locations of our facilities as compared to those of many of our competitors, we may be unable to comply with the requirements and limitations of any such grants and incentives, or such agreements may contain restrictions that limit our flex ibility  to pursue changes in business strategy  or transactions that may enhance stockholder value. For example, in November 2024 we entered into a direct funding agreement with the US Department of Commerce under the CHIPS Act that contains detailed milestones we must achieve for us to receive the funds, including with respect to achievement of various milestones with respect to capital expenditures, facility completion, process technology development, wafer production, Intel products insourcing, and external foundry customer acquisitions. It also contains restrictions on certain 'change of control' transactions we are permitted to engage in, a requirement that we share with the US government project returns above specified thresholds, and various termination rights and remedies if we were to breach the agreement, including potential repayment of some or all of the awards. To the extent funding is below our expectations, we elect not to accept any grants or incentives due to burdensome compliance requirements, we are required to return any amounts received from any grants or incentives due to an inability to comply with any requirements or limitations contained therein, we are subject to restrictions as a result of any awards we have accepted, or the US government delays or does not provide any awards",

      "question": "How might AMD's $48 million licensing gain from royalty income in 2024 support its increased R&D spending on AI and restructuring efforts?",
      "answer": "AMD reported a $48 million licensing gain from royalty income in 2024, stemming from its intellectual property licensing to the THATIC JV. This non-operational revenue stream contributed to AMD's overall income and may have helped offset some of the increased costs associated with its strategic initiatives. Specifically, the company invested $6.5 billion in R&D in 2024, a $584 million increase from the prior year, largely driven by its AI strategy. Additionally, AMD incurred $186 million in restructuring charges as part of the 2024 Restructuring Plan, which aimed to align resources with growth opportunities in AI and enterprise markets. The licensing gain, while not directly funding these initiatives, provided incremental financial flexibility during a year of significant strategic investment.",

      "answer": "QTL, which licenses OFDMA-based 5G/4G/3G technologies, generated $5,572 million in revenue and $4,027 million in EBT in fiscal 2024, compared to QCT's $33,196 million in revenue and $9,527 million in EBT. This indicates that while QTL contributes significantly less in absolute revenue than QCT, it maintains a much higher profit margin (~72% vs ~29%). This aligns with QTL\u2019s strategic focus on high-margin patent licensing, particularly for OFDMA-based technologies, despite legal challenges that could potentially disrupt its licensing model. The high EBT margin underscores the profitability of the licensing model, even as the company faces risks related to ongoing legal and regulatory scrutiny of its licensing practices.",

The licenses granted under our existing license agreements generally cover multimode CDMA/OFDMA (3G/4G/5G) devices, and our licensees are obligated to pay royalties under their license agreements for their sales of such devices.\n\nStandards bodies have been informed that we hold patents that might be essential for all 3G standards that are based on CDMA, patents that are potentially essential for 4G technologies and patents and pending patent applications that are potentially essential for 5G technologies. We have committed to such standards bodies that we will offer to license our essential patents for these standards consistent with our commitments to those bodies. We have made similar commitments with respect to certain other technologies implemented in industry standards.\n\nQTL licensing revenues include per-unit royalties and, to a lesser extent, lump sum payments (i.e., license fees, substantially all of which were recognized prior to fiscal 2024). Licensees pay quarterly royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property. Per-unit royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items), with certain products subject to per unit minimums and/or per unit caps. Certain products may also have a fixed royalty amount per unit.\n\nThe vast majority of QTL revenues have been generated through our licensees' sales of OFDMA-based products (including 3G/4G and 3G/4G/5G multimode devices), such as smartphones and other devices. We have invested in both the acquisition and development of, and continue to invest in the development of, OFDMA technology and intellectual property and have generated the industry leading patent portfolio applicable to LTE, LTE Advanced, LTE Advanced Pro and 5G NR. Some of our inventions that serve as foundational technologies for 3G and 4G also serve as foundational technologies for 5G. We have invested and continue to invest in the development of 5G and continue to play a significant role in driving advancements of 5G. Nevertheless, we face competition in the development of intellectual property for future generations of digital wireless communications technologies and services.\n\nOur license agreements also may provide us with rights to use certain of our licensees' technology and intellectual property to manufacture, sell and/or use certain components (e.g., application-specific integrated circuits) and related software, cellular devices and/or infrastructure equipment.\n\nWe have been in the past, currently are, and may in the future be subject to certain legal proceedings and/or governmental investigations challenging our patent licensing practices, including certain matters described in this Annual Report under the heading 'Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 7. Commitments and Contingencies.' Such governmental investigations and/or legal proceedings could require us to change our patent licensing practices, as described herein in 'Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors' under the heading ' Changes in our patent licensing practices, whether due to governmental investigations, legal challenges or otherwise, could adversely impact our business and results of operations. '\n\nQSI Segment. QSI makes strategic investments primarily through our Qualcomm Ventures arm that are focused on expanding or opening new opportunities for our technologies as well as supporting the design and introduction of new products and services (or enhancing existing products or services). Many of these strategic investments are in early-stage companies in a variety of industries and applications, including but not limited to 5G, AI, automotive, consumer, enterprise, cloud, IoT and XR. Investments primarily include non-marketable equity securities and, to a lesser extent, marketable equity securities and convertible debt instruments. In addition, QSI segment results include revenues and related costs associated with certain development contracts with one of our investees. As part of our strategic investment activities, we generally intend to pursue various exit strategies for each of our QSI investments in the foreseeable future.\n\nOther Businesses. Nonreportable segments include our QGOV business and our cloud computing processing initiative. QGOV provides development and other services and sells related products to U.S. government agencies and their contractors.\n\nSeasonality. Information regarding seasonality is provided in this Annual Report in 'Part II, Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations' in the 'Our Business and Operating Segments' section under the heading 'Seasonality.'\n\n## Corporate Structure\n\nWe operate our businesses through our parent company, QUALCOMM Incorporated, and multiple direct and indirect subsidiaries. We have developed our corporate structure in order to address various legal, regulatory, tax , contractual compliance, operational and other matters. Substantially all of our products and services businesses, including QCT, and substantially all of our engineering and research and development functions, are operated by Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. (QTI), a subsidiary of QUALCOMM Incorporated, and QTI's subsidiaries. QTL is operated by QUALCOMM Incorporated, which owns the vast majority of our patent portfolio. Snapdragon and Qualcomm branded products are products of QTI and/or its subsidiaries. Qualcomm patents are licensed by QUALCOMM Incorporated. Neither QTI nor any of its subsidiaries has any right, power or authority to grant any licenses or other rights under or to any patents owned by QUALCOMM Incorporated.",

      "question": "Given the significant goodwill attributed to the Analog segment in the balance sheet, how does the company's recent R&D spending trend on Analog products reflect the strategic importance of this segment, especially when comparing 2023 to 2022?",
      "answer": "The company attributed $4,158 million in goodwill specifically to the Analog segment in 2023, highlighting its strategic importance. This is supported by the company's R&D spending, which increased from $1,178 million in 2022 to $1,317 million in 2023 for the Analog segment, indicating a continued investment in innovation for this segment. Despite a decline in Analog revenue from $15,359 million in 2022 to $13,040 million in 2023, the increase in R&D spending suggests that the company is prioritizing long-term growth and product development in Analog, aligning with the high goodwill valuation.",

      "answer": "Oracle reported a 79% increase in foreign currency losses, which reached $199 million in fiscal 2022, contributing significantly to the total non-operating expense swing from $282 million income in 2021 to $522 million expense in 2022. Given this volatility, Oracle's decision to exclude non-operating expenses\u2014including foreign exchange impacts\u2014from segment margin reporting (as disclosed on page 106) suggests an effort to provide more stable and comparable performance metrics across reporting periods. By removing these fluctuating items, Oracle aims to reflect the core operational performance of its business segments without distortion from unpredictable foreign currency movements and other non-operating factors.",

Externally, Microsoft reports that Server Products and Cloud Services is a key component of the broader Microsoft Cloud revenue, which reached $111.6 billion in fiscal year 2023. This suggests that while Intelligent Cloud is a major internal segment, it is part of a larger externally defined cloud revenue category that spans multiple segments, including Office 365 Commercial, LinkedIn, and Dynamics 365.

      "question": "Given Intel Foundry Services' increasing operating losses from $281 million in 2022 to $482 million in 2023, what does the segment's continued inclusion in Intel's operating structure suggest about the company's strategic approach to its foundry business despite near-term financial underperformance?",
      "answer": "The continued inclusion of Intel Foundry Services (IFS) as a distinct operating segment in Intel's organizational structure, despite its growing operating losses increasing from $281 million in 2022 to $482 million in 2023, suggests that the company maintains a long-term strategic commitment to the foundry business. This decision indicates that Intel's leadership, specifically the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), views IFS as integral to its broader business transformation and future growth potential, even as the segment currently detracts from overall profitability. The deliberate retention of IFS within the operating segments framework, as opposed to consolidating it into 'All other' or discontinuing operations, implies an expectation that the segment will eventually contribute positively to Intel's strategic positioning in semiconductor manufacturing.",

        "Hop 1: INTC(page_88) \u2192 Total Operating Income: Discloses that Intel Foundry Services had operating losses of $482 million in 2023, up from $281 million in 2022, indicating worsening financial performance.",
        "Hop 2: Total Operating Income \u2192 Intel Foundry Services: The financial performance of IFS is directly tied to the segment's operating income, which is disclosed in the income statement, showing a significant deterioration in 2023.",
        "Hop 3: Intel Foundry Services \u2190 INTC(page_87): Despite the segment's losses, IFS is maintained as a distinct operating segment in Intel's organizational structure, suggesting strategic importance and long-term investment intent."

      "answer": "The 10-K filing shows that QCT, Qualcomm\u2019s largest segment, generated $33.196 billion in revenues and contributed $9.527 billion to EBT in fiscal 2024, reflecting its core role in handset and automotive chip sales. Meanwhile, QSI reported only $18 million in revenues but a positive $104 million EBT, a significant turnaround from a $(12) million EBT in fiscal 2023. However, the consolidated EBT of $10.336 billion is notably reduced by $3.322 billion in reconciling items, which likely include intersegment eliminations and corporate-level adjustments. This implies that while QCT drives most of the profitability, QSI\u2019s positive EBT may be influenced by internal transfers or cost allocations that are offset in reconciling items, suggesting a complex interplay between segments in consolidated reporting.",

However, this segment also absorbs various corporate-level expenses not used in evaluating or allocating resources to the main operating segments, including environmental costs. Since these environmental costs are not allocated to the main segments like Analog or Embedded Processing and are instead included in Other, they reduce the segment's profitability. This affects how the $1.11 billion in revenue should be interpreted\u2014while it appears substantial, it may be partially offset by unitemized corporate expenses such as environmental costs, making the segment less profitable than revenue figures alone suggest.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm's QCT segment recognizes substantially all of its equipment revenues at a point in time, typically upon shipment (as disclosed in the segment revenue disaggregation on page 73). However, in the broader revenue recognition policy section (page 68), the company explains that it estimates sales-based royalties using preliminary licensee reports and adjusts these estimates in subsequent periods as actual sales data becomes available. This creates a mixed revenue recognition framework where the QCT segment's hardware sales follow a point-in-time model, while the licensing-driven revenue adjustments occur over time as licensee reporting cycles evolve. The company reconciles this by distinguishing between the timing of shipment-based revenue recognition for products and the estimation-based approach for royalties, which are adjusted as more complete data becomes available from licensees.",

          "chunk_text": "## QUALCOMM Incorporated\n\n## NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n\nindefinite-lived intangible assets are quantitatively assessed for impairment, if necessary, by comparing their estimated fair values to their carrying values. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, the difference is recorded as an impairment. Our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to goodwill, other indefinite-lived assets and longlived assets may be based on operational performance of our businesses, market conditions, expected selling price and/or other factors. Although there are inherent uncertainties in this assessment process, the estimates and assumptions we use, including estimates of future cash flows and discount rates, are consistent with our internal planning, when appropriate. If these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record an impairment charge on a portion or all of such assets. Furthermore, we cannot predict the occurrence of future impairment-triggering events nor the impact such events might have on our reported asset values.\n\nLong-lived assets, such as property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization, are reviewed for impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group. If the carrying amount of an asset or asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or asset group exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset or asset group. Long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale are reported at the lower of their carrying amounts or their estimated fair values less costs to sell and are not depreciated.\n\nRevenue Recognition. We derive revenues principally from sales of integrated circuit products and licensing of our intellectual property. We also generate revenues from licensing system software and by performing development and other services and from other product sales. The timing of revenue recognition and the amount of revenue actually recognized in each case depends upon a variety of factors, including the specific terms of each arrangement and the nature of our performance obligations.\n\nRevenues from sales of our products are recognized upon transfer of control to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment. Revenues from providing services are typically recognized over time as our performance obligation is satisfied. Revenues from providing services and licensing system software were each less than 5% of total revenues for all periods presented.\n\nWe grant licenses or otherwise provide rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which, among other rights, includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture, sale or use of certain wireless products. Licensees pay royalties based on their sales of products incorporating or using our licensed intellectual property and may also pay a fixed license fee in one or more installments. Sales-based royalties are generally based upon a percentage of the wholesale (i.e., licensee's) selling price of complete licensed products, net of certain permissible deductions (including transportation, insurance, packing costs and other items). We broadly provide per unit royalty caps that apply to certain categories of complete wireless devices, such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and smartwatches, and provide for a maximum royalty amount payable per device. We estimate and recognize sales-based royalties on such licensed products in the period in which the associated sales occur, considering all relevant information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us. Our estimates of sales-based royalties are based largely on preliminary royalty estimates provided by our licensees and, to a lesser extent, an assessment of the volume of devices supplied into the market that incorporate or use our licensed intellectual property, combined with an estimate of the mix of such sales on a licensee-by-licensee basis, as well as the licensees' average wholesale prices of such products. In the periods presented, we have recognized immaterial differences between preliminary royalty estimates provided to us by licensees and actual amounts reported and paid by licensees, which are generally received the following quarter, as licensees have not completed their royalty reporting process at the time estimates are provided to us, and in certain cases, they do not provide all necessary information in order for us to calculate an estimate of royalties due, which requires us to independently estimate certain information. We also consider in our estimates of sales-based royalties any changes in pricing we plan or expect to make and certain constraints on our ability to estimate such royalties. As a result of recognizing revenues in the period in which the licensees' sales occur using estimates, adjustments to revenues are required in subsequent periods to reflect changes in estimates as new information becomes available, primarily resulting from actual amounts reported by our licensees.\n\nLicense agreements that require payment of license fees contain a single performance obligation that represents ongoing access to a portfolio of intellectual property over the license term since such agreements provide the licensee the right to access a portfolio of intellectual property that exists at inception of the license agreement and to updates and new intellectual property that is added to the licensed portfolio during the term of the agreement that are highly interdependent or interrelated. Since we expect to expend efforts to develop and transfer updates to our licensed portfolio on an even basis, license fees are recognized as revenues on a straight-line basis over the estimated period of benefit of the license to the licensee.\n\nWe account for a contract with a customer/licensee when it is legally enforceable, the parties are committed to perform their respective obligations, the rights of the parties regarding the goods and/or services to be transferred are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of substantially all of the consideration is probable, which for product sales, is generally when a customer purchase order is executed and for licensing revenues, is generally upon execution of a license agreement.

According to the segment reporting methodology, unallocated expenses\u2014including certain interest expenses\u2014are excluded from segment EBT evaluations and are instead considered at the corporate level. This implies that while QTL's standalone EBT appears strong, the company's overall profitability is meaningfully affected by these non-allocated charges, which are centrally managed and not borne by individual segments like QTL.

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software with advanced connectivity and high-performance, low-power computing technologies for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices, industrial devices and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud computing processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate ex penses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to certain corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development",

      "answer": "EMEA revenues were flat in fiscal 2024, with declines in the Banking & Capital Markets segment being a key contributing factor, particularly in France and the United Kingdom. This is notable because Banking & Capital Markets is a critical component of ACN's global Financial Services industry group, which generated $11.6B in FY24 revenues, with 69% of that group\u2019s revenue tied to Banking & Capital Markets clients. The regional underperformance in a strategically important vertical raises concerns about ACN's ability to translate its global focus and industry expertise into consistent growth within EMEA, especially in key financial services markets.",

Specifically, $4.2 billion in amortization, stock-based compensation, and acquisition-related costs from Xilinx are excluded from the operating income of the Embedded and Data Center segments and instead recorded under the All Other category.

      "question": "Given the Analog segment's dominant revenue position in 2024, how did its margin performance contribute to the overall gross margin contraction from 2022 to 2024?",
      "answer": "TXN's gross margin declined from $13,771 million in 2022 to $9,094 million in 2024, representing a significant contraction in profitability. In 2024, the Analog segment contributed $12,161 million in revenue (77.8% of total revenue) and incurred $4,869 million in cost of revenue, resulting in a gross profit of $7,292 million. While the Analog segment maintained a strong gross profit margin of approximately 60% (7,292 / 12,161), this was likely insufficient to offset the overall margin decline, especially considering the drop in total revenue from $20,028 million in 2022 to $15,641 million in 2024. The segment's dominant revenue share means its margin performance had a disproportionately large impact on the company's overall gross profit trend, suggesting that the decline in both total revenue and gross margin was significantly influenced by the Analog segment's 2024 performance relative to its earlier, stronger years.",

      "answer": "Qualcomm's overall EBT declined from $10,274 million in 2021 to $14,998 million in 2022, but this masks significant internal shifts. QCT, Qualcomm's semiconductor business, saw its EBT grow from $7,763 million to $12,837 million, a 65% increase, driven by strong demand across mobile, automotive, and IoT markets. However, this was partially offset by a sharp decline in QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives), which swung from a $916 million profit in 2021 to a $279 million loss in 2022. The QCT segment, which is central to Qualcomm\u2019s core operations and described in detail on page 83 as the driver of integrated circuits and system software across key industries, absorbed much of the burden of QSI's underperformance, highlighting the resilience of Qualcomm\u2019s core semiconductor business despite strategic investment losses.",

        "Hop 2: QSI (EBT) \u2192 QCT (SEGMENT): QCT's EBT rose from $7,763 million in 2021 to $12,837 million in 2022, directly offsetting QSI's decline in the consolidated EBT calculation.",

Our operating segments reflect the way our businesses and management/reporting structure are organized internally and the way our Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM), who is our CEO, reviews financial information, makes operating decisions and assesses business performance. We also consider, among other items, the way budgets and forecasts are prepared and reviewed and the basis on which executive compensation is determined, as well as the similarities and the level of centralized resource planning within our operating segments, such as the nature of products, the level of shared products, technology and other resources, production processes and customer base. We conduct business primarily through our QCT semiconductor business and our QTL licensing business. QCT develops and supplies integrated circuits and system software based on 3G/4G/5G and other technologies, including RFFE, for use in mobile devices; automotive systems for connectivity, digital cockpit and ADAS/AD; and IoT including consumer electronic devices; industrial devices; and edge networking products. QTL grants licenses or otherwise provides rights to use portions of our intellectual property portfolio, which includes certain patent rights essential to and/or useful in the manufacture and sale of certain wireless products. Our QSI (Qualcomm Strategic Initiatives) reportable segment makes strategic investments. We also have nonreportable segments, including QGOV (Qualcomm Government Technologies) and our cloud AI inference processing initiative.\n\nOur CODM allocates resources to and evaluates the performance of our segments based on revenues and earnings (loss) before income taxes (EBT). Segment EBT includes the allocation of certain corporate expenses to the segments, including depreciation and amortization expense related to unallocated corporate assets. Certain income and charges are not allocated to segments in our management reports because they are not considered in evaluating the segments' operating performance. Unallocated income and charges include certain interest expense, certain net investment income, certain share-based compensation, gains and losses on our deferred compensation plan liabilities and related assets and certain research and development expenses, certain selling, general and administrative expenses and other expenses or income that were deemed to be not directly related to the businesses of the segments. Additionally, unallocated charges include recognition of the step-up of inventories and property, plant and equipment to fair value, amortization of certain intangible assets and certain other acquisition-related charges, third-party acquisition and integration services costs and certain other items, which may include major restructuring and restructuring-related costs, asset impairment charges and awards, settlements and/or damages arising from legal or regulatory matters.
