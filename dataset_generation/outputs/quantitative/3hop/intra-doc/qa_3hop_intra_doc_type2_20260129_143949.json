      "question": "How do the financial impacts of Linde's merger-related divestitures compare across its segment sales reporting, detailed divestiture disclosures, and cash flow from investing activities?",
      "answer": "The merger-related divestitures had a measurable impact across Linde\u2019s financial reporting: in 2019, $65 million of sales from these divestitures were excluded from segment reporting (APAC segment), as disclosed in the sales breakdown. The full scope of these divestitures included $2.9 billion from the Americas industrial gases business sale to Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners, $1.2 billion from Linde South Korea, $193 million from Linde India, and $98 million from Linde China. These proceeds were reflected in the company\u2019s investing activities, where 2020 divestiture proceeds included $98 million from the China divestiture and approximately $130 million from a non-core Scandinavian business, contributing to a total of $482 million in divestiture proceeds that year. This shows a consistent thread from strategic divestiture execution to financial reporting and cash flow impact.",

The new standard is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020, with early adoption permitted. The adoption of this standard did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial statements.\n- Reference  Rate  Reform -  In  March  2020  with  amendments  in  2021,  the  FASB  issued  guidance  related  to reference  rate  reform  which  provides  practical  expedients  and  exceptions  for  applying  U.S.  GAAP  to  contract modifications,  hedging  relationships  and  other  transactions  that  the  reference  London  Interbank  Offered  Rate ('LIBOR') and other interbank offered rates. This update is applicable to our contracts and hedging relationships that reference LIBOR and other interbank offered rates. The amendments may be applied to impacted contracts and hedges prospectively through December 31, 2022. The application of this guidance did not materially impact the company's consolidated financial statements.\n\n## NOTE 2. Business Combination and Divestitures\n\n## Merger of Praxair, Inc. and Linde AG\n\nOn October 31, 2018 Praxair and Linde AG combined their respective businesses through an all-stock transaction and became subsidiaries of the company.\n\n## Linde AG Merger-Related Divestitures - Primarily Americas Industrial Gases Business\n\nAs a condition of the U.S. regulatory approval of the merger, Linde AG agreed to sell the majority of its industrial gases business in the Americas, as described below:\n\n- The Linde AG Americas Sales and Purchase Agreement, dated July 16, 2018, as and further amended on September 22, 2018, October 19, 2018, and February 20, 2019 whereby Linde AG and Praxair, Inc. entered into an agreement with a consortium comprising companies of the German industrial gases manufacturer Messer Group and CVC Capital Partners Fund  VII  to  sell  the  majority  of  Linde  AG's  industrial  gases  business  in  North  America  and  certain  industrial  gases business activities of Linde AG's in South America for $2.9 billion in cash consideration after purchase price adjustments for certain items relating to assets and liabilities of the sold businesses. In addition, divestitures include $0.5 billion of proceeds for incremental plant sales within the Americas under other agreements. These transactions were completed on March 1, 2019.\n- On April 30, 2019, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde South Korea with the sale price of $1.2 billion to IMM Private Equity Inc., to satisfy requirements of the Korea Fair Trade Commission. The assets divested include bulk and on-site business in Giheung, Pohang and Seosan sites as well as oxygen and nitrogen on-site generators.\n- On December 16, 2019, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde India with a sale price of $193 million.\n- In March 2020, Linde completed the sale of select assets of Linde China with a sale price of $98 million.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

      "question": "How does Linde's treatment of cost reduction programs in its operating profit compare with the cash flow adjustments and capital allocation impacts, and what does this reveal about the company's efficiency initiatives and financial discipline?",
      "answer": "Linde's cost reduction programs are reflected as a direct deduction from operating profit, with charges of $273 million in 2021, indicating a material impact on profitability. However, in the cash flow statement, the adjustments for cost reduction programs and other charges show a net inflow of $98 million in 2021, suggesting that not all program costs were cash outflows during the year. This divergence implies that some charges were non-cash or accrued over time. Furthermore, when viewed alongside capital allocation metrics \u2014 including $3,086 million in capital expenditures and $4,612 million in share repurchases \u2014 the relatively modest cash impact of cost reduction efforts in 2021 indicates disciplined execution of efficiency initiatives without significantly constraining strategic investments or shareholder returns.",

      "question": "How do Linde's disclosures on Cost Reduction Programs and Other Charges across its segment reporting, adjusted earnings metrics, and deconsolidation of a joint venture reflect differing financial impacts and strategic framing of these charges across the company's reporting?",
      "answer": "Linde's disclosures show that Cost Reduction Programs and Other Charges were $273 million in 2021 (with $279 million after tax and noncontrolling interests) and were broken down by segment in the footnotes. These charges were added back to calculate Adjusted Operating Profit, increasing it from $4,984 million to $7,176 million in 2021, indicating a significant normalization adjustment for operational performance. Additionally, the deconsolidation of an APAC joint venture in 2021 resulted in a $52 million gain recorded within Cost Reduction Programs and Other Charges, revealing that part of the charge category includes restructuring gains, not just costs. Together, these perspectives show that while the company incurred substantial restructuring charges, certain actions like divestitures also yielded gains within the same category, reflecting a mix of cost-cutting initiatives and strategic realignments.",

          "chunk_text": "\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 there were no material amounts of capital expenditures or significant operating or investing non-cash items related to discontinued operations.\n\n## Non-Merger Related Acquisitions\n\nNon-merger related acquisitions of $88 million, $68 million and $225 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were primarily related to the Americas and are not material, individually or in the aggregate.\n\n## Non-Merger Related Divestitures\n\nEffective  January  1,  2021,  Linde  deconsolidated  a  joint  venture  with  operations  in  APAC,  due  to  the  expiration  of  certain contractual rights that the parties mutually agreed not to renew. From the effective date, the joint venture is reflected as an equity investment on Linde's consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding results reflected in income from equity investments on the consolidated statement of income.\n\nThe fair value of the joint venture at January 1, 2021 was determined using a discounted cash flow model and approximated the carrying  amount  of  its  net  assets.  The  net  carrying  value  of  $852  million  was  mainly  comprised  of  assets  of  approximately $1.9 billion (primarily Other intangibles and Property plant and equipment - net), net of liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion. Upon  deconsolidation  an  equity  investment  was  recorded  representing  Linde's  share  of  the  joint  venture's  net  assets.  The deconsolidation resulted in a gain of $52 million recorded within cost reduction programs and other charges (see Note 3) related to the release of the CTA balance recorded within AOCI. The company did not receive any consideration, cash or otherwise, as part of the deconsolidation.\n\nThe joint venture contributed sales of approximately $600 million in 2020. Future earnings per share will not be affected as the ownership percent remains the same.\n\n## NOTE 3. COST REDUCTION PROGRAMS AND OTHER CHARGES\n\nCost  reduction  programs  and  other  charges  were  $273  million,  $506  million,  and  $567  million  for  the  12  months  ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

      "answer": "Linde adjusted for Bond Redemption in its interest expense, income taxes, and diluted EPS calculations, reducing the impact of this non-recurring item to present a more normalized financial performance. In 2021, the company removed $16 million from adjusted interest expense, $4 million from adjusted income taxes, and 0.02 from adjusted diluted EPS. These adjustments suggest a deliberate effort to smooth financial results and highlight underlying profitability by excluding one-time bond-related costs, indicating a capital structure strategy that prioritizes long-term stability over short-term accounting volatility.",

      "question": "How does Linde's significant increase in net purchases of ordinary shares in 2021, relative to 2020, reflect in both its financing activities and overall cash flow management, and what does this indicate about its capital allocation priorities?",
      "answer": "Linde spent $4,562 million on net purchases of ordinary shares in 2021, a significant increase from $2,410 million in 2020. This outflow was a major component of its $7,588 million in total cash used for financing activities, which also included increased dividends of $2,189 million. Despite strong operating cash flow of $9,725 million, the company's cash balance still decreased by $931 million due to the large outflows for share repurchases and dividends. This indicates that Linde prioritized returning capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, even as it maintained capital expenditures and reduced net debt, suggesting a balanced but shareholder-focused capital allocation strategy.",

Volume growth across all end markets and project start-ups increased sales by 8% . Higher pricing across all geographic segments contributed 3% to sales. Favorable currency translation and higher cost pass-through increased sales by 5%, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC which decreased sales by 3% .\n- Reported operating profit of $4,984 million was 50% above 2020. Adjusted operating profit of $7,176 million was 24% above 2020. The increase in both reported and adjusted operating profit was primarily driven by higher volume and price and the benefit of cost reduction programs and other charges and productivity initiatives, partially offset by the deconsolidation of a joint venture with operations in APAC.*\n- Income from continuing operations of $3,821 million and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $7.32 increased from $2,497 million and $4.70, respectively in 2020. Adjusted income from continuing operations of $5,579 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of $10.69 were 28% and 30%, respectively above 2020 adjusted amounts.*\n- Cash flow from operations of $9,725 million was 31% above 2020. Capital expenditures were $3,086 million; dividends paid were $2,189 million; net purchases of ordinary shares of $4,562 million; and debt repayments, net were $514 million.\n\n*A reconciliation of the adjusted amounts can be found in the \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section in this MD&amp;A.\n\n## 2022 Outlook\n\nLinde provides quarterly updates on operating results, material trends that may affect financial performance, and financial guidance via earnings releases and investor teleconferences.

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\n## Investing\n\n## 2021 compared with 2020\n\nNet cash used for investing activities was $3,007 million in 2021 compared to $2,986 million in 2020. The increase was primarily driven by lower proceeds from divestitures in 2021, largely offset by lower capital expenditures.\n\nCapital expenditures in 2021 were $3,086 million, a decrease of $314 million from 2020. Capital expenditures during 2021 related primarily to investments in new plant and production equipment for growth. Approximately 42% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 32% in the APAC segment and the rest primarily in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt  December 31,  2021  ,  Linde's  sale  of  gas  backlog  of  large  projects  under  construction  was  approximately  $3.5  billion.  This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisition expenditures in 2021 were $88 million, an increase of $20 million from 2020 and related primarily to acquisitions in the Americas and EMEA. Acquisitions for the year ended December 31, 2020 were $68 million and related to acquisitions in the Americas and APAC.\n\nDivestitures  and  asset  sales  in  2021  totaled  $167  million  as  compared  to  $482  million  in  2020.  The  2020  period  includes  net proceeds  from  merger-related  divestitures  of  $98  million  from  the  sale  of  selected  assets  of  Linde  China  and  proceeds  of approximately $130 million related to the divestiture of a non-core business in Scandinavia.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and  intercompany  funding  to  minimize  the  total  cost  of  funds  and  to  manage  and  centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As deemed necessary, Linde manages its exposure to interest-rate changes through the use of financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $7,588 million in 2021 compared to $3,345 million in 2020. Cash used for debt was $514 million in 2021 versus cash provided by debt of $1,313 million in 2020 primarily due to lower proceeds from debt issuances and decreased commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower debt repayments. Net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,562 million in 2021 versus $2,410 million in 2020. Cash dividends increased to $2,189 million in 2021 versus $2,028 million in 2020 driven primarily by a 10% increase in dividends per share from $3.852 per share to $4.24 per share. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $323 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 versus cash used of $220 million for the respective 2020 period primarily due to the settlement of the buyout of minority interests in the Republic of South Africa in January of 2021.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs around the world. At December 31, 2021, Linde's credit ratings as reported by Standard &amp; Poor's and Moody's were A-1 and P-1 for short-term debt, respectively, and A and A2 for long-term debt, respectively.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity in 2021, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments.  Linde's  credit  facilities  are  with  major  financial  institutions  and  are  non-cancelable  until  maturity.  Therefore,  the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe company maintains a $5 billion unsecured and undrawn revolving credit agreement with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreement as of December 31, 2021. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nLinde's  total  net  debt  outstanding  at  December  31,  2021  was  $11,384  million,  $1,016  million  lower  than  $12,400  million  at December  31,  2020.  The  December  31,  2021  net  debt  balance  includes  $13,069  million  in  public  securities,  $1,138  million representing  primarily  worldwide  bank  borrowings,  net  of  $2,823  million  of  cash.  Linde's  global  effective  borrowing  rate  was approximately 1.4% for 2021.",

The increase was driven by higher  net  income  adjusted  for  non-cash  charges  and  lower  working  capital  requirements,  including  an  increase  in  contract liabilities due to engineering customer advanced payments, which more than offset higher cash taxes. Cost reduction programs and other charges, net of payments was $98 million and $258 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, representing charges of $273 million and $506 million net of related cash outflows of $175 million and $248 million, respectively, in each period.",

These charges are also reflected in the long-term liabilities section (page 63), where the balance for cost reduction programs and other charges stood at $66 million as of December 31, 2024, indicating that not all costs have been fully settled and some remain accrued.

      "answer": "Linde reported $145 million in cost reduction program and other charges for 2024 (page_54), which included $165 million in severance costs and a $43 million benefit from an APAC divestiture. These charges were reconciled against segment operating profit on page_25, where they were subtracted from the $9,720 million total segment operating profit to arrive at the reported $8,635 million operating profit. Meanwhile, page_20 notes that despite cost inflation, productivity gains helped reduce cost of sales as a percentage of sales from 53.2% to 51.9%, indicating that the cost reduction program contributed to broader cost management efforts. The 2024 charges were significantly higher than the prior year\u2019s $40 million, which had primarily related to Engineering segment severance and intercompany reorganization, suggesting a more aggressive restructuring effort in 2024 aimed at sustaining profitability amid flat sales.",

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nThe fair value of the previously held equity interest was based upon a purchase price valuation (excluding debt) multiplied by the company's previously held ownership interest adjusted by a discount for lack of marketability.  The fair value of property, plant &amp; equipment, net was based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset, based on the most advantageous market for the asset (i.e., its highest and best use). The cost approach, adjusted for the age and condition of the property, plant and equipment, was used to estimate fair value.\n\nIdentifiable intangible assets primarily consisted of customer relationships of approximately $245 million that will be amortized over their estimated useful life of 20 years. The fair value of the customer relationships intangible asset was valued using a multi-period excess earnings method, a form of the income approach, which incorporates the estimated future cash flows to be generated from nexAir, LLC's existing customer base. There were no indefinite-lived intangible assets identified in conjunction with the acquisition.\n\nThe excess of the consideration for the acquisition over the preliminary fair value of net assets acquired was recorded as goodwill. The acquisition resulted in $485 million of goodwill, the majority of which is ex pected to be deductible for tax  purposes. The goodwill balance is primarily attributable to the assembled workforce and operating synergies expected to result from the acquisition. The goodwill recorded as a result of the acquisition was allocated to the Americas reportable segment, which represents the reportable segment anticipated to experience operating synergies as a result of the acquisition.\n\n## Divestitures\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales were $170 million, $70 million, and $195 million for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## 2022 Sale of GIST business\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, the company completed the sale of its GIST business. Proceeds from the sale were $184 million, net of cash divested of $75 million, for net proceeds of $109 million. The sale resulted in a loss of $21 million (benefit of $3 million, after tax ), recorded within cost reduction program and other charges in the consolidated statement of income (see Note 3).\n\n## NOTE 3. COST REDUCTION PROGRAM AND OTHER CHARGES\n\n## 2024 Charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $145 million for the year ended December 31, 2024. Costs include severance of $165 million, other cost reduction charges of $23 million, and a benefit of $43 million related to a divestiture in APAC. Cost reduction program and other charges for 2024 included an income tax benefit of $35 million.\n\n## 2023 Charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. Costs primarily related to severance in the Engineering segment and expenses incurred due to the intercompany reorganization for the year ended December 31, 2023. Cost reduction program and other charges for 2023 included an income tax benefit of $81 million primarily comprised of a benefit of $124 million related to the resolution of an income tax audit, partially offset by an accrual of $85 million for the potential settlement of an international income tax  matter.\n\n## 2022 Charges\n\nCost  reduction  program  and  other  charges  were  $1  billion  ($896  million,  after  tax   and  noncontrolling  interests)  for  the  year  ended  December  31,  2022,  largely attributable to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.\n\n## Russia-Ukraine Conflict\n\nIn response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, multiple jurisdictions, including Europe and the U.S., have imposed several tranches of economic sanctions on Russia. As a result, Linde reassessed its ability to control its Russian subsidiaries and determined that as of June 30, 2022 it can no longer ex ercise control over these entities. As such, Linde deconsolidated its Russian gas and engineering business entities as of June 30, 2022. The deconsolidation of the company's Russian gas and engineering business entities resulted in a loss of $787 million ($730 million after tax ).\n\nThe fair value of Linde's Russian subsidiaries was determined using a probability weighted discounted cash flow model, which resulted in the recognition of a $407 million loss on deconsolidation when compared to the carrying value of the entities. This loss is recorded within cost reduction program and other charges in the consolidated statements of income.",

          "chunk_text": "\n## 2024 Compared With 2023\n\n## Sales\n\nLinde sales were flat for the 2024 year versus 2023. Sales grew 2% from higher price attainment. Volumes were flat, as new project start-ups were largely offset by base volume declines. Cost pass-through, representing the contractual billing of energy cost variances primarily to onsite customers decreased sales by 1%, with minimal impact on operating profit. Currency translation decreased sales by 1%, primarily due to the weakening of the Brazilian real, Chinese yuan, and Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.\n\n## Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization\n\nCost of sales, ex clusive of depreciation and amortization, decreased $349 million, or 2%, for the year primarily due to lower cost pass-through and productivity gains, which more than offset cost inflation. Cost of sales, exclusive of depreciation and amortization, was 51.9% and 53.2% of sales, in 2024 and 2023, respectively. The decrease as a percentage of sales was primarily due to higher pricing and lower cost pass-through.\n\n## Selling, general and administrative expenses\n\nSelling, general and administrative expense (\"SG &amp;A\") increased $42 million, or 1%, from $3,295 million in 2023 to $3,337 million in 2024 driven by higher costs. SG &amp;A was 10.1% of sales in 2024 versus 10.0% in 2023. Currency impacts decreased SG&amp;A by approximately $28 million in 2024.\n\n## Depreciation and amortization\n\nReported depreciation and amortization expense decreased $36 million, or 1%, versus 2023. The decrease is due to lower depreciation and amortization of assets acquired in the merger partially offset by the net impact of new project start ups.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, depreciation and amortization expense increased $32 million, or 1%, versus 2023. Currency impacts decreased depreciation and amortization by $17 million in 2024. Ex cluding currency, underlying depreciation and amortization increased due to the net impact of new project start ups.\n\n## Cost reduction program and other charges\n\nCost reduction program and other charges were $145 million and $40 million for 2024 and 2023, respectively. 2024 includes severance charges of $165 million, other cost reduction charges of $23 million, and other benefit of $43 million related to a divestiture in APAC. In 2023, the costs primarily related to severance in the Engineering segment and expenses incurred due to the intercompany reorganization.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, these charges have been excluded in both periods.\n\n## Other income (expense) - net\n\nReported other income (expense) - net was a benefit of $185 million in 2024 and expense of $41 million in 2023. In 2024, other income included a benefit of $41 million related to a settlement with a supplier in the Americas and $45 million in insurance recoveries primarily within the Other segment (Note 7).\n\n## Operating profit",

      "question": "How does Linde's treatment of its Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges in the income statement adjustments, operating cash flows, and EBITDA reconciliation collectively reflect its financial strategy and operational impact across 2024?",
      "answer": "Linde's Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges are presented differently across three financial contexts: in the income statement adjustments, they are used to derive Adjusted EBITDA, where a charge of $145 million is added back to EBITDA, signaling a strategic focus on excluding these charges for performance evaluation. In the operating cash flows, the charges amounted to $31 million in 2024, indicating a smaller operational cash impact compared to prior years. Meanwhile, in the reconciliation of EPS, the charges contributed positively with $0.26 per share in 2024, suggesting that these charges, while present, had a mitigated effect on earnings per share. Together, these perspectives show that while the program is material enough to be itemized in disclosures, its financial impact was relatively modest in 2024 and was strategically adjusted to reflect underlying performance.",

        "Hop 1: [Linde](page_41) \u2192 Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges: Disclosed in Note 3 of the financial statements, indicating its materiality and the need for detailed accounting treatment.",
        "Hop 2: [Linde](page_48) \u2192 Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges: Reflected in the cash flow statement under operating activities with a $31 million adjustment in 2024, showing its operational cash impact.",
        "Hop 3: [Linde](page_37) \u2192 Cost Reduction Program and Other Charges: Appears in both the EPS reconciliation (+$0.26/share) and EBITDA adjustment (+$145 million), indicating strategic exclusion from performance metrics to reflect core earnings."

      "question": "How does Linde's significant increase in cash used for noncontrolling interest transactions in 2024, compared to 2023, align with its overall financing activity trends and its capital structure management strategy, particularly in relation to debt issuance and share repurchases?",
      "answer": "Linde's cash used for noncontrolling interest transactions increased to $420 million in 2024 from $53 million in 2023, reflecting a substantial shift in financing-related activities. This increase occurred alongside a rise in net debt issuances to $3,167 million in 2024, which was used to fund capital expenditures ($4,497 million), share repurchases ($4,451 million), and higher dividend payments. Despite the significant outflow related to noncontrolling interest transactions, Linde maintained a strong liquidity position with $4,850 million in cash and access to $6.5 billion in undrawn credit facilities, indicating that the company managed this increase without compromising its financial flexibility or credit profile.",
      "reasoning_steps": [
        "Hop 1: LIN(page_48) \u2192 Noncontrolling Interest Transactions: The cash flow statement shows that cash used for noncontrolling interest transactions was $420 million in 2024, a significant increase from $53 million in 2023.",
        "Hop 2: LIN(page_31) \u2192 Noncontrolling Interest Transactions: The financing section notes that the $420 million outflow was primarily driven by financing-related derivative activities, indicating a strategic or operational shift in how Linde manages its noncontrolling interests.",
        "Hop 3: LIN(page_30) \u2192 Noncontrolling Interest Transactions: The comparative cash flow table confirms the $420 million outflow under financing activities and places it in the context of Linde's broader financing activities, including net debt increases and share repurchases."

          "chunk_text": "## Table of Contents\n\nApproximately 58% of the capital expenditures were in the Americas segment with 22% in the APAC segment and the rest largely in the EMEA segment.\n\nAt December 31, 2024, Linde's sale of gas backlog of large projects under construction was approximately $7.1 billion. This represents the total estimated capital cost of large plants under construction.\n\nAcquisitions, net of cash acquired for 2024 were $317 million, a decrease of $636 million from 2023. In 2024, acquisitions were primarily related to packaged gas businesses  in  the Americas. Acquisitions  in  the  prior  year  were  $953  million  related  primarily  to  the  acquisition  of  nexAir  in  the Americas  (see  Note  2  to  the consolidated financial statements).\n\nDivestitures, net of cash divested and asset sales in 2024 were $170 million compared with $70 million in 2023. Divestiture proceeds in 2024 include $69 million in net proceeds for a divestiture in APAC and a settlement with a supplier in the Americas.\n\n## Financing\n\nLinde's financing strategy is to secure long-term committed funding by issuing public notes and debentures and commercial paper backed by a long-term bank credit agreement. Linde's international operations are funded through a combination of local borrowing and intercompany funding to minimize the total cost of funds and to manage and centralize  currency  exchange  exposures. As  deemed  necessary,  Linde  manages  its  exposure  to  interest-rate  changes  through  the  use  of  financial derivatives (see Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk).\n\nCash used for financing activities was $4,359 million in 2024 compared to $5,400 million in 2023. Cash provided by debt was $3,167 million in 2024 versus $1,060 million in 2023, driven primarily by higher net debt issuances partially offset by lower commercial paper issuances in 2024. In February 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac550 million of 1.20% notes that became due and issued \u20ac700 million of 3.00% notes due in 2028, \u20ac850 million of 3.20% notes due in 2031 and \u20ac700 million of 3.40% notes due in 2036. In May 2024, Linde repaid \u20ac300 million of 1.875% notes that became due. In June 2024, Linde issued \u20ac750 million of 3.375% notes due in 2030, \u20ac750 million of 3.500% notes due in 2034 and \u20ac700 million of 3.75% notes due in 2044. In December 2024, Linde repaid $300 million of 4.800% notes that became due.\n\nIn February 2025, Linde issued \u20ac850 million of 2.625% notes due in 2029, \u20ac750 million of 3.00% notes due in 2033 and \u20ac650 million of 3.25% notes due in 2037. Linde redeemed $600 million of 4.70% notes that were due in 2025.\n\nNet purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million in 2024 versus $3,925 million in 2023. For additional information related to share repurchase programs, see Part II Item 5. Market for Registrant's Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities.\n\nCash dividends increased to $2,655 million in 2024 versus $2,482 million in 2023 driven primarily by a 9% increase in dividends per share to $5.56 per share from $5.10 per share, partially offset by lower shares outstanding. Cash used for Noncontrolling interest transactions and other was $420 million for the year ended December 31, 2024 versus cash used of $53 million for the respective 2023 period, primarily driven by financing related derivative outflows.\n\nLinde's total net debt outstanding at December 31, 2024 was $16,773 million, $2,064 million higher than $14,709 million at December 31, 2023. The December 31, 2024 net debt balance includes $21,140 million in public securities, and $483 million representing primarily worldwide bank borrowings, net of $4,850 million of cash. Linde's global effective borrowing rate was approximately 2.5% for 2024.\n\nThe company believes that it has sufficient operating flexibility, cash reserves, and funding sources to maintain adequate amounts of liquidity to meet its business needs  around  the  world. At  December  31,  2024,  Linde's  credit  ratings  as  reported  by  Standard  &amp;  Poor's  and  Moody's  were A-1  and  P-1  for  short-term  debt, respectively,  and A  and A2  for  long-term  debt,  respectively.  The  company  maintains  a  $5  billion  and  a  $1.5  billion  unsecured  and  undrawn  revolving  credit agreements with no associated financial covenants. No borrowings were outstanding under the credit agreements as of December 31, 2024. The company does not anticipate any limitations on its ability to access the debt capital markets and/or other external funding sources and remains committed to its strong ratings from Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor's.\n\nNote 11 to the consolidated financial statements includes information with respect to the company's debt activity, current debt position, debt covenants and the available credit facilities; and Note 12 includes information relating to derivative financial instruments. Linde's credit facilities are with major financial institutions and are non-cancelable until maturity. Therefore, the company believes the risk of the financial institutions being unable to make required loans under the credit facilities, if requested, to be low. Linde's major bank credit and long-term debt agreements contain standard covenants. The company was in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2024 and expects to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future.",

      "question": "How does Linde plc's net issuance or purchase of ordinary shares in 2024 reconcile across the cash flow statement, the shareholder equity statement, and the financing activities summary, and what does this reveal about the company's capital allocation strategy?",
      "answer": "Linde plc's net purchases of ordinary shares were $4,451 million in 2024 according to the financing activities summary, which aligns with the $4,459 million net cash used for share purchases in the cash flow statement. The shareholder equity statement shows that the company repurchased 10,076 million treasury shares at a cost of $4,459 million during the year. This consistent portrayal across all three sections indicates a deliberate capital allocation strategy focused on returning value to shareholders through share repurchases, despite maintaining a relatively small level of new share issuances for employee incentive plans.",

      "question": "How does Linde plc's use of non-GAAP adjustments for purchase accounting impacts related to Linde AG affect its adjusted net income, adjusted net debt, and tax-adjusted operating metrics, and what does this reveal about the financial implications of the merger on performance evaluation and capital structure?",
      "answer": "Linde plc adjusts its financial metrics for purchase accounting impacts related to Linde AG to provide a clearer view of operational performance. In 2023, the company added $818 million in purchase accounting impacts to reported net income of $6,199 million, resulting in an adjusted net income of $6,989 million. This adjustment supports management\u2019s evaluation of performance and variable compensation, which is based on results excluding these impacts. Meanwhile, purchase accounting impacts also reduce adjusted net debt, with a balance of $(7) million in 2023 compared to $(22) million in 2022, indicating a smaller offset to debt in the current year. On the tax side, purchase accounting impacts contributed $232 million to adjusted income taxes, influencing the adjusted effective tax rate calculation. These adjustments reflect the company's belief that purchase accounting distortions\u2014primarily from depreciation and amortization of fair value step-ups\u2014should be excluded to ensure comparability across segments and against peers.",

      "question": "How do Linde's reported operating profit, adjusted net debt, and adjusted operating margin reflect the evolving impact of purchase accounting adjustments related to Linde AG, and what does this suggest about the company's underlying financial performance and leverage position?",
      "answer": "Linde's reported operating profit in 2023 was $8,024 million, which includes a negative adjustment of $1,006 million due to purchase accounting impacts from Linde AG. This adjustment is significantly smaller than in prior years, indicating a declining influence of past acquisitions on current earnings. In contrast, the company's adjusted net debt in 2023 was $14,702 million, which reflects a minimal reduction of $7 million due to purchase accounting impacts\u2014down sharply from $22 million in 2022\u2014suggesting a reduced amortization or run-off of acquisition-related liabilities. Furthermore, the adjusted operating margin of 27.6% in 2023, which adds back the $1,006 million purchase accounting impact, shows a stronger operational performance compared to the reported margin of 24.4%. Together, these figures indicate that while the company's financial statements are increasingly less affected by historical purchase accounting adjustments, its underlying profitability has improved, and its leverage remains stable despite rising net debt.",

      "question": "How does the decline in income from equity investments in 2023 compared to 2022, as reported in the income statement, reconcile with the adjusted performance metrics and the stated impact of regional investment performance, particularly in APAC?",
      "answer": "In 2023, reported income from equity investments declined to $167 million from $172 million in 2022. On an adjusted basis, the decline was more pronounced, falling to $239 million from $247 million, with the decrease attributed to weaker performance of investments in the APAC region. This aligns with the broader income statement context where income from equity investments contributed minimally to overall income from continuing operations, which stood at $6,341 million in 2023 versus $4,281 million in 2022. Despite the drop in equity investment income, overall net income increased significantly, indicating that core operational improvements offset the decline in investment returns.",

        "Hop 2: [LIN](page_22) \u2192 [Income from Equity Investments]: The comparative performance metrics table confirms the $167 million figure for 2023 and notes a 3% decline from 2022, placing the metric in the context of overall net income growth of 49%.",

      "answer": "Linde evaluates the performance of its Engineering segment using segment operating profit, which excludes purchase accounting impacts from the Linde AG merger, intercompany royalties, and non-recurring items. This metric is used consistently by the Chief Operating Decision Maker to assess performance and allocate resources. Although the Engineering segment accounts for only 10% of total sales, it operates on a worldwide basis across all geographic regions (Americas, EMEA, and APAC), distinguishing it from the regionally managed industrial gases segments. The global nature of the Engineering business necessitates a centralized performance evaluation approach, despite its relatively smaller revenue contribution.",
